THE HISTORY OF WHITTINGTON Dick Whittington was a very little boy when his father and mother died ; so little , indeed , that he never knew them , nor the place where he was born .
He strolled about the country as ragged as a colt , till he met with a wagoner who was going to London , and who gave him leave to walk all the way by the side of his wagon without paying anything for his passage .
This pleased little Whittington very much , as he wanted to see London sadly , for he had heard that the streets were paved with gold , and he was willing to get a bushel of it ; but how great was his disappointment , poor boy !
when he saw the streets covered with dirt instead of gold , and found himself in a strange place , without a friend , without food , and without money .
Though the wagoner was so charitable as to let him walk up by the side of the wagon for nothing , he took care not to know him when he came to town , and the poor boy was , in a little time , so cold and hungry that he wished himself in a good kitchen and by a warm fire in the country .
In his distress he asked charity of several people , and one of them bid him `` Go to work for an idle rogue . ''
`` That I will , '' said Whittington , `` with all my heart ; I will work for you if you will let me . ''
The man , who thought this savored of wit and impertinence -LRB- though the poor lad intended only to show his readiness to work -RRB- , gave him a blow with a stick which broke his head so that the blood ran down .
In this situation , and fainting for want of food , he laid himself down at the door of one Mr. Fitzwarren , a merchant , where the cook saw him , and , being an ill-natured hussy , ordered him to go about his business or she would scald him .
At this time Mr. Fitzwarren came from the Exchange , and began also to scold at the poor boy , bidding him to go to work .
Whittington answered that he should be glad to work if anybody would employ him , and that he should be able if he could get some victuals to eat , for he had had nothing for three days , and he was a poor country boy , and knew nobody , and nobody would employ him .
He then endeavored to get up , but he was so very weak that he fell down again , which excited so much compassion in the merchant that he ordered the servants to take him in and give him some meat and drink , and let him help the cook to do any dirty work that she had to set him about .
People are too apt to reproach those who beg with being idle , but give themselves no concern to put them in the way of getting business to do , or considering whether they are able to do it , which is not charity .
But we return to Whittington , who could have lived happy in this worthy family had he not been bumped about by the cross cook , who must be always roasting and basting , or when the spit was idle employed her hands upon poor Whittington !
At last Miss Alice , his master 's daughter , was informed of it , and then she took compassion on the poor boy , and made the servants treat him kindly .
Besides the crossness of the cook , Whittington had another difficulty to get over before he could be happy .
He had , by order of his master , a flock-bed placed for him in a garret , where there was a number of rats and mice that often ran over the poor boy 's nose and disturbed him in his sleep .
After some time , however , a gentleman who came to his master 's house gave Whittington a penny for brushing his shoes .
This he put into his pocket , being determined to lay it out to the best advantage ; and the next day , seeing a woman in the street with a cat under her arm , he ran up to know the price of it .
The woman -LRB- as the cat was a good mouser -RRB- asked a deal of money for it , but on Whittington 's telling her he had but a penny in the world , and that he wanted a cat sadly , she let him have it .
This cat Whittington concealed in the garret , for fear she should be beat about by his mortal enemy the cook , and here she soon killed or frightened away the rats and mice , so that the poor boy could now sleep as sound as a top .
Soon after this the merchant , who had a ship ready to sail , called for his servants , as his custom was , in order that each of them might venture something to try their luck ; and whatever they sent was to pay neither freight nor custom , for he thought justly that God Almighty would bless him the more for his readiness to let the poor partake of his fortune .
All the servants appeared but poor Whittington , who , having neither money nor goods , could not think of sending anything to try his luck ; but his good friend Miss Alice , thinking his poverty kept him away , ordered him to be called .
She then offered to lay down something for him , but the merchant told his daughter that would not do , it must be something of his own .
Upon which poor Whittington said he had nothing but a cat which he bought for a penny that was given him .
`` Fetch thy cat , boy , '' said the merchant , `` and send her . ''
Whittington brought poor puss and delivered her to the captain , with tears in his eyes , for he said he should now be disturbed by the rats and mice as much as ever .
All the company laughed at the adventure but Miss Alice , who pitied the poor boy , and gave him something to buy another cat .
While puss was beating the billows at sea , poor Whittington was severely beaten at home by his tyrannical mistress the cook , who used him so cruelly , and made such game of him for sending his cat to sea , that at last the poor boy determined to run away from his place , and having packed up the few things he had , he set out very early in the morning on All-Hallows day .
He traveled as far as Holloway , and there sat down on a stone to consider what course he should take ; but while he was thus ruminating , Bow bells , of which there were only six , began to ring ; and he thought their sounds addressed him in this manner : `` Turn again , Whittington , Thrice Lord Mayor of London . ''
`` Lord Mayor of London ! ''
said he to himself , `` what would not one endure to be Lord Mayor of London , and ride in such a fine coach ?
Well , I 'll go back again , and bear all the pummelling and ill-usage of Cicely rather than miss the opportunity of being Lord Mayor ! ''
So home he went , and happily got into the house and about his business before Mrs. Cicely made her appearance .
We must now follow Miss Puss to the coast of Africa .
How perilous are voyages at sea , how uncertain the winds and the waves , and how many accidents attend a naval life !
The ship that had the cat on board was long beaten at sea , and at last , by contrary winds , driven on a part of the coast of Barbary which was inhabited by Moors unknown to the English .
These people received our countrymen with civility , and therefore the captain , in order to trade with them , showed them the patterns of the goods he had on board , and sent some of them to the King of the country , who was so well pleased that he sent for the captain and the factor to come to his palace , which was about a mile from the sea .
Here they were placed , according to the custom of the country , on rich carpets , flowered with gold and silver ; and the King and Queen being seated at the upper end of the room , dinner was brought in , which consisted of many dishes ; but no sooner were the dishes put down but an amazing number of rats and mice came from all quarters and devoured all the meat in an instant .
The factor , in surprise , turned round to the nobles and asked if these vermin were not offensive .
`` Oh !
yes , '' said they , `` very offensive ; and the King would give half his treasure to be freed of them , for they not only destroy his dinner , as you see , but they assault him in his chamber , and even in bed , so that he is obliged to be watched while he is sleeping , for fear of them . ''
The factor jumped for joy ; he remembered poor Whittington and his cat , and told the King he had a creature on board the ship that would despatch all these vermin immediately .
The King 's heart heaved so high at the joy which this news gave him that his turban dropped off his head .
`` Bring this creature to me , '' said he ; `` vermin are dreadful in a court , and if she will perform what you say I will load your ship with gold and jewels in exchange for her . ''
The factor , who knew his business , took this opportunity to set forth the merits of Miss Puss .
He told his Majesty that it would be inconvenient to part with her , as , when she was gone , the rats and mice might destroy the goods in the ship -- but to oblige his Majesty he would fetch her .
`` Run , run , '' said the Queen ; `` I am impatient to see the dear creature . ''
Away flew the factor , while another dinner was providing , and returned with the cat just as the rats and mice were devouring that also .
He immediately put down Miss Puss , who killed a great number of them .
The King rejoiced greatly to see his old enemies destroyed by so small a creature , and the Queen was highly pleased , and desired the cat might be brought near that she might look at her .
Upon which the factor called `` Pussy , pussy , pussy ! ''
and she came to him .
He then presented her to the Queen , who started back , and was afraid to touch a creature who had made such havoc among the rats and mice ; however , when the factor stroked the cat and called `` Pussy , pussy ! ''
the Queen also touched her and cried `` Putty , putty ! ''
for she had not learned English .
He then put her down on the Queen 's lap , where she , purring , played with her Majesty 's hand , and then sang herself to sleep .
The King , having seen the exploits of Miss Puss , and being informed that her kittens would stock the whole country , bargained with the captain and factor for the whole ship 's cargo , and then gave them ten times as much for the cat as all the rest amounted to .
On which , taking leave of their Majesties and other great personages at court , they sailed with a fair wind for England , whither we must now attend them .
The morn had scarcely dawned when Mr. Fitzwarren arose to count over the cash and settle the business for that day .
He had just entered the counting-house , and seated himself at the desk , when somebody came , tap , tap , at the door .
`` Who 's there ? ''
said Mr. Fitzwarren .
`` A friend , '' answered the other .
`` What friend can come at this unseasonable time ? ''
`` A real friend is never unseasonable , '' answered the other .
`` I come to bring you good news of your ship Unicorn . ''
The merchant bustled up in such a hurry that he forgot his gout ; instantly opened the door , and who should be seen waiting but the captain and factor , with a cabinet of jewels , and a bill of lading , for which the merchant lifted up his eyes and thanked heaven for sending him such a prosperous voyage .
Then they told him the adventures of the cat , and showed him the cabinet of jewels which they had brought for Mr. Whittington .
Upon which he cried out with great earnestness , but not in the most poetical manner : `` Go , send him in , and tell him of his fame , And call him Mr. Whittington by name . ''
It is not our business to animadvert upon these lines ; we are not critics , but historians .
It is sufficient for us that they are the words of Mr. Fitzwarren ; and though it is beside our purpose , and perhaps not in our power to prove him a good poet , we shall soon convince the reader that he was a good man , which was a much better character ; for when some who were present told him that this treasure was too much for such a poor boy as Whittington , he said : `` God forbid that I should deprive him of a penny ; it is his own , and he shall have it to a farthing . ''
He then ordered Mr. Whittington in , who was at this time cleaning the kitchen and would have excused himself from going into the counting-house , saying the room was swept and his shoes were dirty and full of hob-nails .
The merchant , however , made him come in , and ordered a chair to be set for him .
Upon which , thinking they intended to make sport of him , as had been too often the case in the kitchen , he besought his master not to mock a poor simple fellow , who intended them no harm , but let him go about his business .
The merchant , taking him by the hand , said : `` Indeed , Mr. Whittington , I am in earnest with you , and sent for you to congratulate you on your great success .
Your cat has procured you more money than I am worth in the world , and may you long enjoy it and be happy ! ''
At length , being shown the treasure , and convinced by them that all of it belonged to him , he fell upon his knees and thanked the Almighty for his providential care of such a poor and miserable creature .
He then laid all the treasure at his master 's feet , who refused to take any part of it , but told him he heartily rejoiced at his prosperity , and hoped the wealth he had acquired would be a comfort to him , and would make him happy .
He then applied to his mistress , and to his good friend Miss Alice , who refused to take any part of the money , but told him she heartily rejoiced at his good success , and wished him all imaginable felicity .
He then gratified the captain , factor , and the ship 's crew for the care they had taken of his cargo .
He likewise distributed presents to all the servants in the house , not forgetting even his old enemy the cook , though she little deserved it .
After this Mr. Fitzwarren advised Mr. Whittington to send for the necessary people and dress himself like a gentleman , and made him the offer of his house to live in till he could provide himself with a better .
Now it came to pass when Mr. Whittington 's face was washed , his hair curled , and he dressed in a rich suit of clothes , that he turned out a genteel young fellow ; and , as wealth contributes much to give a man confidence , he in a little time dropped that sheepish behavior which was principally occasioned by a depression of spirits , and soon grew a sprightly and good companion , insomuch that Miss Alice , who had formerly pitied him , now fell in love with him .
When her father perceived they had this good liking for each other he proposed a match between them , to which both parties cheerfully consented , and the Lord Mayor , Court of Aldermen , Sheriffs , the Company of Stationers , the Royal Academy of Arts , and a number of eminent merchants attended the ceremony , and were elegantly treated at an entertainment made for that purpose .
History further relates that they lived very happy , had several children , and died at a good old age .
Mr. Whittington served as Sheriff of London and was three times Lord Mayor .
In the last year of his mayoralty he entertained King Henry V and his Queen , after his conquest of France , upon which occasion the King , in consideration of Whittington 's merit , said : `` Never had prince such a subject '' ; which being told to Whittington at the table , he replied : `` Never had subject such a king . ''
His Majesty , out of respect to his good character , conferred the honor of knighthood on him soon after .
Sir Richard many years before his death constantly fed a great number of poor citizens , built a church and a college to it , with a yearly allowance for poor scholars , and near it erected a hospital .
He also built Newgate for criminals , and gave liberally to St. Bartholomew 's Hospital and other public charities .
THE WONDERFUL SHEEP Once upon a time -- in the days when the fairies lived -- there was a king who had three daughters , who were all young , and clever , and beautiful ; but the youngest of the three , who was called Miranda , was the prettiest and the most beloved .
The King , her father , gave her more dresses and jewels in a month than he gave the others in a year ; but she was so generous that she shared everything with her sisters , and they were all as happy and as fond of one another as they could be .
Now , the King had some quarrelsome neighbors , who , tired of leaving him in peace , began to make war upon him so fiercely that he feared he would be altogether beaten if he did not make an effort to defend himself .
So he collected a great army and set off to fight them , leaving the Princesses with their governess in a castle where news of the war was brought every day -- sometimes that the King had taken a town , or won a battle , and , at last , that he had altogether overcome his enemies and chased them out of his kingdom , and was coming back to the castle as quickly as possible , to see his dear little Miranda whom he loved so much .
The three Princesses put on dresses of satin , which they had had made on purpose for this great occasion , one green , one blue , and the third white ; their jewels were the same colors .
The eldest wore emeralds , the second turquoises , and the youngest diamonds , and thus adorned they went to meet the King , singing verses which they had composed about his victories .
When he saw them all so beautiful and so gay he embraced them tenderly , but gave Miranda more kisses than either of the others .
Presently a splendid banquet was served , and the King and his daughters sat down to it , and as he always thought that there was some special meaning in everything , he said to the eldest : `` Tell me why you have chosen a green dress . ''
`` Sire , '' she answered , `` having heard of your victories I thought that green would signify my joy and the hope of your speedy return . ''
`` That is a very good answer , '' said the King ; `` and you , my daughter , '' he continued , `` why did you take a blue dress ? ''
`` Sire , '' said the Princess , `` to show that we constantly hoped for your success , and that the sight of you is as welcome to me as the sky with its most beautiful stars . ''
`` Why , '' said the King , `` your wise answers astonish me , and you , Miranda .
What made you dress yourself all in white ?
`` Because , sire , '' she answered , `` white suits me better than anything else . ''
`` What ! ''
said the King angrily , `` was that all you thought of , vain child ? ''
`` I thought you would be pleased with me , '' said the Princess ; `` that was all . ''
The King , who loved her , was satisfied with this , and even pretended to be pleased that she had not told him all her reasons at first .
`` And now , '' said he , `` as I have supped well , and it is not time yet to go to bed , tell me what you dreamed last night . ''
The eldest said she had dreamed that he brought her a dress , and the precious stones and gold embroidery on it were brighter than the sun .
The dream of the second was that the King had brought her a spinning wheel and a distaff , that she might spin him some shirts .
But the youngest said : `` I dreamed that my second sister was to be married , and on her wedding-day , you , father , held a golden ewer and said : ` Come , Miranda , and I will hold the water that you may dip your hands in it . ' ''
The King was very angry indeed when he heard this dream , and frowned horribly ; indeed , he made such an ugly face that everyone knew how angry he was , and he got up and went off to bed in a great hurry ; but he could not forget his daughter 's dream .
`` Does the proud girl wish to make me her slave ? ''
he said to himself .
`` I am not surprised at her choosing to dress herself in white satin without a thought of me .
She does not think me worthy of her consideration !
But I will soon put an end to her pretensions ! ''
He rose in a fury , and although it was not yet daylight , he sent for the Captain of his Bodyguard , and said to him : `` You have heard the Princess Miranda 's dream ?
I consider that it means strange things against me , therefore I order you to take her away into the forest and kill her , and , that I may be sure it is done , you must bring me her heart and her tongue .
If you attempt to deceive me you shall be put to death ! ''
The Captain of the Guard was very much astonished when he heard this barbarous order , but he did not dare to contradict the King for fear of making him still more angry , or causing him to send someone else , so he answered that he would fetch the Princess and do as the King had said .
When he went to her room they would hardly let him in , it was so early , but he said that the King had sent for Miranda , and she got up quickly and came out ; a little black girl called Patypata held up her train , and her pet monkey and her little dog ran after her .
The monkey was called Grabugeon , and the little dog Tintin .
The Captain of the Guard begged Miranda to come down into the garden where the King was enjoying the fresh air , and when they got there , he pretended to search for him , but as he was not to be found , he said : `` No doubt his Majesty has strolled into the forest , '' and he opened the little door that led to it and they went through .
By this time the daylight had begun to appear , and the Princess , looking at her conductor , saw that he had tears in his eyes and seemed too sad to speak .
`` What is the matter ? ''
she said in the kindest way .
`` You seem very sorrowful . ''
`` Alas !
Princess , '' he answered , `` who would not be sorrowful who was ordered to do such a terrible thing as I am ?
The King has commanded me to kill you here , and carry your heart and your tongue to him , and if I disobey I shall lose my life . ''
The poor Princess was terrified , she grew very pale and began to cry softly .
Looking up at the Captain of the Guard with her beautiful eyes , she said gently : `` Will you really have the heart to kill me ?
I have never done you any harm , and have always spoken well of you to the King .
If I had deserved my father 's anger I would suffer without a murmur , but , alas !
he is unjust to complain of me , when I have always treated him with love and respect . ''
`` Fear nothing , Princess , '' said the Captain of the Guard .
`` I would far rather die myself than hurt you ; but even if I am killed you will not be safe : we must find some way of making the King believe that you are dead . ''
`` What can we do ? ''
said Miranda ; `` unless you take him my heart and my tongue he will never believe you . ''
The Princess and the Captain of the Guard were talking so earnestly that they did not think of Patypata , but she had overheard all they said , and now came and threw herself at Miranda 's feet .
`` Madam , '' she said , `` I offer you my life ; let me be killed , I shall be only too happy to die for such a kind mistress . ''
`` Why , Patypata , '' cried the Princess , kissing her , `` that would never do ; your life is as precious to me as my own , especially after such a proof of your affection as you have just given me . ''
`` You are right , Princess , '' said Grabugeon , coming forward , `` to love such a faithful slave as Patypata ; she is of more use to you than I am , I offer you my tongue and my heart most willingly , especially as I wish to make a great name for myself in Goblin Land . ''
`` No , no , my little Grabugeon , '' replied Miranda , `` I can not bear the thought of taking your life . ''
`` Such a good little dog as I am , '' cried Tintin , `` could not think of letting either of you die for his mistress .
If anyone is to die for her it must be me . ''
And then began a great dispute between Patypata , Grabugeon , and Tintin , and they came to high words , until at last Grabugeon , who was quicker than the others , ran up to the very top of the nearest tree , and let herself fall , head first , to the ground , and there she lay -- quite dead !
The Princess was very sorry , but as Grabugeon was really dead , she allowed the Captain of the Guard to take her tongue ; but , alas !
it was such a little one -- not bigger than the Princess 's thumb -- that they decided sorrowfully that it was of no use at all : the King would not have been taken in by it for a moment !
`` Alas !
my little monkey , '' cried the Princess , `` I have lost you , and yet I am no better off than I was before . ''
`` The honor of saving your life is to be mine , '' interrupted Patypata , and , before they could prevent her , she had picked up a knife and cut her head off in an instant .
But when the Captain of the Guard would have taken her tongue it turned out to be quite black , so that would not have deceived the King either .
`` Am I not unlucky ? ''
cried the poor Princess ; `` I lose everything I love , and am none the better for it . ''
`` If you had accepted my offer , '' said Tintin , `` you would only have had me to regret , and I should have had all your gratitude . ''
Miranda kissed her little dog , crying so bitterly , that at last she could bear it no longer , and turned away into the forest .
When she looked back the Captain of the Guard was gone , and she was alone , except for Patypata , Grabugeon , and Tintin , who lay upon the ground .
She could not leave the place until she had buried them in a pretty little mossy grave at the foot of a tree , and she wrote their names upon the bark of the tree , and how they had all died to save her life .
And then she began to think where she could go for safety -- for this forest was so close to her father 's castle that she might be seen and recognized by the first passer-by , and , besides that , it was full of lions and wolves , who would have snapped up a princess just as soon as a stray chicken .
So she began to walk as fast as she could , but the forest was so large and the sun was so hot that she nearly died of heat and terror and fatigue ; look which way she would there seemed to be no end to the forest , and she was so frightened that she fancied every minute that she heard the King running after her to kill her .
You may imagine how miserable she was , and how she cried as she went on , not knowing which path to follow , and with the thorny bushes scratching her dreadfully and tearing her pretty frock to pieces .
At last she heard the bleating of a sheep , and said to herself : `` No doubt there are shepherds here with their flocks ; they will show me the way to some village where I can live disguised as a peasant girl .
Alas !
it is not always kings and princes who are the happiest people in the world .
Who could have believed that I should ever be obliged to run away and hide because the King , for no reason at all , wishes to kill me ? ''
So saying she advanced toward the place where she heard the bleating , but what was her surprise when , in a lovely little glade quite surrounded by trees , she saw a large sheep ; its wool was as white as snow , and its horns shone like gold ; it had a garland of flowers round its neck , and strings of great pearls about its legs , and a collar of diamonds ; it lay upon a bank of orange-flowers , under a canopy of cloth of gold which protected it from the heat of the sun .
Nearly a hundred other sheep were scattered about , not eating the grass , but some drinking coffee , lemonade , or sherbet , others eating ices , strawberries and cream , or sweetmeats , while others , again , were playing games .
Many of them wore golden collars with jewels , flowers , and ribbons .
Miranda stopped short in amazement at this unexpected sight , and was looking in all directions for the shepherd of this surprising flock , when the beautiful sheep came bounding toward her .
`` Approach , lovely Princess , '' he cried ; `` have no fear of such gentle and peaceable animals as we are . ''
`` What a marvel ! ''
cried the Princess , starting back a little .
`` Here is a sheep that can talk . ''
`` Your monkey and your dog could talk , madam , '' said he ; `` are you more astonished at us than at them ? ''
`` A fairy gave them the power to speak , '' replied Miranda .
`` So I was used to them . ''
`` Perhaps the same thing has happened to us , '' he said , smiling sheepishly .
`` But , Princess , what can have led you here ? ''
`` A thousand misfortunes , Sir Sheep , '' she answered .
`` I am the unhappiest princess in the world , and I am seeking a shelter against my father 's anger . ''
`` Come with me , madam , '' said the Sheep ; `` I offer you a hiding-place which you only will know of , and where you will be mistress of everything you see . ''
`` I really can not follow you , '' said Miranda , `` for I am too tired to walk another step . ''
The Sheep with the golden horns ordered that his chariot should be fetched , and a moment after appeared six goats , harnessed to a pumpkin , which was so big that two people could quite well sit in it , and was all lined with cushions of velvet and down .
The Princess stepped into it , much amused at such a new kind of carriage , the King of the Sheep took his place beside her , and the goats ran away with them at full speed , and only stopped when they reached a cavern , the entrance to which was blocked by a great stone .
This the King touched with his foot , and immediately it fell down , and he invited the Princess to enter without fear .
Now , if she had not been so alarmed by everything that had happened , nothing could have induced her to go into this frightful cave , but she was so afraid of what might be behind her that she would have thrown herself even down a well at this moment .
So , without hesitation , she followed the Sheep , who went before her , down , down , down , until she thought they must come out at the other side of the world -- indeed , she was not sure that he was n't leading her into Fairyland .
At last she saw before her a great plain , quite covered with all sorts of flowers , the scent of which seemed to her nicer than anything she had ever smelled before ; a broad river of orange-flower water flowed round it and fountains of wine of every kind ran in all directions and made the prettiest little cascades and brooks .
The plain was covered with the strangest trees , there were whole avenues where partridges , ready roasted , hung from every branch , or , if you preferred pheasants , quails , turkeys , or rabbits , you had only to turn to the right hand or to the left and you were sure to find them .
In places the air was darkened by showers of lobster-patties , white puddings , sausages , tarts , and all sorts of sweetmeats , or with pieces of gold and silver , diamonds and pearls .
This unusual kind of rain , and the pleasantness of the whole place , would , no doubt , have attracted numbers of people to it , if the King of the Sheep had been of a more sociable disposition , but from all accounts it is evident that he was as grave as a judge .
As it was quite the nicest time of the year when Miranda arrived in this delightful land the only palace she saw was a long row of orange trees , jasmines , honeysuckles , and musk-roses , and their interlacing branches made the prettiest rooms possible , which were hung with gold and silver gauze , and had great mirrors and candlesticks , and most beautiful pictures .
The Wonderful Sheep begged that the Princess would consider herself queen over all that she saw , and assured her that , though for some years he had been very sad and in great trouble , she had it in her power to make him forget all his grief .
`` You are so kind and generous , noble Sheep , '' said the Princess , `` that I can not thank you enough , but I must confess that all I see here seems to me so extraordinary that I do n't know what to think of it . ''
As she spoke a band of lovely fairies came up and offered her amber baskets full of fruit , but when she held out her hands to them they glided away , and she could feel nothing when she tried to touch them .
`` Oh ! ''
she cried , `` what can they be ?
Whom am I with ? ''
and she began to cry .
At this instant the King of the Sheep came back to her , and was so distracted to find her in tears that he could have torn his wool .
`` What is the matter , lovely Princess ? ''
he cried .
`` Has anyone failed to treat you with due respect ? ''
`` Oh !
no , '' said Miranda ; `` only I am not used to living with sprites and with sheep that talk , and everything here frightens me .
It was very kind of you to bring me to this place , but I shall be even more grateful to you if you will take me up into the world again . ''
`` Do not be afraid , '' said the Wonderful Sheep ; `` I entreat you to have patience , and listen to the story of my misfortunes .
I was once a king , and my kingdom was the most splendid in the world .
My subjects loved me , my neighbors envied and feared me .
I was respected by everyone , and it was said that no king ever deserved it more .
`` I was very fond of hunting , and one day , while chasing a stag , I left my attendants far behind ; suddenly I saw the animal leap into a pool of water , and I rashly urged my horse to follow it , but before we had gone many steps I felt an extraordinary heat , instead of the coolness of the water ; the pond dried up , a great gulf opened before me , out of which flames of fire shot up , and I fell helplessly to the bottom of a precipice .
`` I gave myself up for lost , but presently a voice said : ` Ungrateful Prince , even this fire is hardly enough to warm your cold heart ! ' ''
` Who complains of my coldness in this dismal place ? '
I cried . ''
` An unhappy being who loves you hopelessly , ' replied the voice , and at the same moment the flames began to flicker and cease to burn , and I saw a fairy , whom I had known as long as I could remember , and whose ugliness had always horrified me .
She was leaning upon the arm of a most beautiful young girl , who wore chains of gold on her wrists and was evidently her slave . ''
` Why , Ragotte , ' I said , for that was the fairy 's name , ` what is the meaning of all this ?
Is it by your orders that I am here ? ' ''
` And whose fault is it , ' she answered , ` that you have never understood me until now ?
Must a powerful fairy like myself condescend to explain her doings to you who are no better than an ant by comparison , though you think yourself a great king ? ' ''
` Call me what you like , ' I said impatiently ; ` but what is it that you want -- my crown , or my cities , or my treasures ? ' ''
` Treasures ! '
said the fairy , disdainfully .
` If I chose I could make any one of my scullions richer and more powerful than you .
I do not want your treasures , but , ' she added softly , ` if you will give me your heart -- if you will marry me -- I will add twenty kingdoms to the one you have already ; you shall have a hundred castles full of gold and five hundred full of silver , and , in short , anything you like to ask me for . ' ''
` Madam Ragotte , ' said I , ` when one is at the bottom of a pit where one has fully expected to be roasted alive , it is impossible to think of asking such a charming person as you are to marry one !
I beg that you will set me at liberty , and then I shall hope to answer you fittingly . ' ''
` Ah ! '
said she , ` if you really loved me you would not care where you were -- a cave , a wood , a fox-hole , a desert , would please you equally well .
Do not think that you can deceive me ; you fancy you are going to escape , but I assure you that you are going to stay here and the first thing I shall give you to do will be to keep my sheep -- they are very good company and speak quite as well as you do .
`` As she spoke she advanced , and led me to this plain where we now stand , and showed me her flock , but I paid little attention to it or to her .
`` To tell the truth , I was so lost in admiration of her beautiful slave that I forgot everything else , and the cruel Ragotte , perceiving this , turned upon her so furious and terrible a look that she fell lifeless to the ground .
`` At this dreadful sight I drew my sword and rushed at Ragotte , and should certainly have cut off her head had she not by her magic arts chained me to the spot on which I stood ; all my efforts to move were useless , and at last , when I threw myself down on the ground in despair , she said to me , with a scornful smile : '' ' I intend to make you feel my power .
It seems that you are a lion at present , I mean you to be a sheep . '
`` So saying , she touched me with her wand , and I became what you see .
I did not lose the power of speech , or of feeling the misery of my present state . ''
` For five years , ' she said , ` you shall be a sheep , and lord of this pleasant land , while I , no longer able to see your face , which I loved so much , shall be better able to hate you as you deserve to be hated . '
`` She disappeared as she finished speaking , and if I had not been too unhappy to care about anything I should have been glad that she was gone .
`` The talking sheep received me as their king , and told me that they , too , were unfortunate princes who had , in different ways , offended the revengeful fairy , and had been added to her flock for a certain number of years ; some more , some less .
From time to time , indeed , one regains his own proper form and goes back again to his place in the upper world ; but the other beings whom you saw are the rivals or the enemies of Ragotte , whom she has imprisoned for a hundred years or so ; though even they will go back at last .
The young slave of whom I told you about is one of these ; I have seen her often , and it has been a great pleasure to me .
She never speaks to me , and if I were nearer to her I know I should find her only a shadow , which would be very annoying .
However , I noticed that one of my companions in misfortune was also very attentive to this little sprite , and I found out that he had been her lover , whom the cruel Ragotte had taken away from her long before ; since then I have cared for , and thought of , nothing but how I might regain my freedom .
I have often been in the forest ; that is where I have seen you , lovely Princess , sometimes driving your chariot , which you did with all the grace and skill in the world ; sometimes riding to the chase on so spirited a horse that it seemed as if no one but yourself could have managed it , and sometimes running races on the plain with the Princesses of your Court -- running so lightly that it was you always who won the prize .
Oh !
Princess , I have loved you so long , and yet how dare I tell you of my love !
what hope can there be for an unhappy sheep like myself ? ''
Miranda was so surprised and confused by all that she had heard that she hardly knew what answer to give to the King of the Sheep , but she managed to make some kind of little speech , which certainly did not forbid him to hope , and said that she should not be afraid of the shadows now she knew that they would some day come to life again .
`` Alas ! ''
she continued , `` if my poor Patypata , my dear Grabugeon , and pretty little Tintin , who all died for my sake , were equally well off , I should have nothing left to wish for here ! ''
Prisoner though he was , the King of the Sheep had still some powers and privileges .
`` Go , '' said he to his Master of the Horse , `` go and seek the shadows of the little black girl , the monkey , and the dog : they will amuse our Princess . ''
And an instant afterward Miranda saw them coming toward her , and their presence gave her the greatest pleasure , though they did not come near enough for her to touch them .
The King of the Sheep was so kind and amusing , and loved Miranda so dearly , that at last she began to love him too .
Such a handsome sheep , who was so polite and considerate , could hardly fail to please , especially if one knew that he was really a king , and that his strange imprisonment would soon come to an end .
So the Princess 's days passed very gaily while she waited for the happy time to come .
The King of the Sheep , with the help of all the flock , got up balls , concerts , and hunting parties , and even the shadows joined in all the fun , and came , making believe to be their own real selves .
One evening , when the couriers arrived -LRB- for the King sent most carefully for news -- and they always brought the very best kinds -RRB- , it was announced that the sister of the Princess Miranda was going to be married to a great Prince , and that nothing could be more splendid than all the preparations for the wedding .
`` Ah ! ''
cried the young Princess , `` how unlucky I am to miss the sight of so many pretty things !
Here am I imprisoned under the earth , with no company but sheep and shadows , while my sister is to be adorned like a queen and surrounded by all who love and admire her , and everyone but myself can go to wish her joy ! ''
`` Why do you complain , Princess ? ''
said the King of the Sheep .
`` Did I say that you were not to go to the wedding ?
Set out as soon as you please ; only promise me that you will come back , for I love you too much to be able to live without you . ''
Miranda was very grateful to him , and promised faithfully that nothing in the world should keep her from coming back .
The King caused an escort suitable to her rank to be got ready for her , and she dressed herself splendidly , not forgetting anything that could make her more beautiful .
Her chariot was of mother-of-pearl , drawn by six dun-colored griffins just brought from the other side of the world , and she was attended by a number of guards in splendid uniforms , who were all at least eight feet high and had come from far and near to ride in the Princess 's train .
Miranda reached her father 's palace just as the wedding ceremony began , and everyone , as soon as she came in , was struck with surprise at her beauty and the splendor of her jewels .
She heard exclamations of admiration on all sides ; and the King her father looked at her so attentively that she was afraid he must recognize her ; but he was so sure that she was dead that the idea never occurred to him .
However , the fear of not getting away made her leave before the marriage was over .
She went out hastily , leaving behind her a little coral casket set with emeralds .
On it was written in diamond letters : `` Jewels for the Bride , '' and when they opened it , which they did as soon as it was found , there seemed to be no end to the pretty things it contained .
The King , who had hoped to join the unknown Princess and find out who she was , was dreadfully disappointed when she disappeared so suddenly , and gave orders that if she ever came again the doors were to be shut that she might not get away so easily .
Short as Miranda 's absence had been , it had seemed like a hundred years to the King of the Sheep .
He was waiting for her by a fountain in the thickest part of the forest , and the ground was strewn with splendid presents which he had prepared for her to show his joy and gratitude at her coming back .
As soon as she was in sight he rushed to meet her , leaping and bounding like a real sheep .
He caressed her tenderly , throwing himself at her feet and kissing her hands , and told her how uneasy he had been in her absence , and how impatient for her return , with an eloquence which charmed her .
After some time came the news that the King 's second daughter was going to be married .
When Miranda heard it she begged the King of the Sheep to allow her to go and see the wedding as before .
This request made him feel very sad , as if some misfortune must surely come of it , but his love for the Princess being stronger than anything else he did not like to refuse her .
`` You wish to leave me , Princess , '' said he ; `` it is my unhappy fate -- you are not to blame .
I consent to your going , but , believe me , I can give you no stronger proof of my love than by so doing . ''
The Princess assured him that she would only stay a very short time , as she had done before , and begged him not to be uneasy , as she would be quite as much grieved if anything detained her as he could possibly be .
So , with the same escort , she set out , and reached the palace as the marriage ceremony began .
Everybody was delighted to see her ; she was so pretty that they thought she must be some fairy princess , and the Princes who were there could not take their eyes off her .
The King was more glad than anyone else that she had come again , and gave orders that the doors should all be shut and bolted that very minute .
When the wedding was all but over the Princess got up quickly , hoping to slip away unnoticed among the crowd , but , to her great dismay , she found every door fastened .
She felt more at ease when the King came up to her , and with the greatest respect begged her not to run away so soon , but at least to honor him by staying for the splendid feast which was prepared for the Princes and Princesses .
He led her into a magnificent hall , where all the Court was assembled , and himself taking up the golden bowl full of water , he offered it to her that she might dip her pretty fingers into it .
At this the Princess could no longer contain herself ; throwing herself at the King 's feet , she cried out : `` My dream has come true after all -- you have offered me water to wash my hands on my sister 's wedding day , and it has not vexed you to do it . ''
The King recognized her at once -- indeed , he had already thought several times how much like his poor little Miranda she was .
`` Oh !
my dear daughter , '' he cried , kissing her , `` can you ever forget my cruelty ?
I ordered you to be put to death because I thought your dream portended the loss of my crown .
And so it did , '' he added , `` for now your sisters are both married and have kingdoms of their own -- and mine shall be for you . ''
So saying he put his crown on the Princess 's head and cried : `` Long live Queen Miranda ! ''
All the Court cried : `` Long live Queen Miranda ! ''
after him , and the young Queen 's two sisters came running up , and threw their arms round her neck , and kissed her a thousand times , and then there was such a laughing and crying , talking and kissing , all at once , and Miranda thanked her father , and began to ask after everyone -- particularly the Captain of the Guard , to whom she owed so much ; but , to her great sorrow , she heard that he was dead .
Presently they sat down to the banquet , and the King asked Miranda to tell them all that had happened to her since the terrible morning when he had sent the Captain of the Guard to fetch her .
This she did with so much spirit that all the guests listened with breathless interest .
But while she was thus enjoying herself with the King and her sisters , the King of the Sheep was waiting impatiently for the time of her return , and when it came and went , and no Princess appeared , his anxiety became so great that he could bear it no longer .
`` She is not coming back any more , '' he cried .
`` My miserable sheep 's face displeases her , and without Miranda what is left to me , wretched creature that I am !
Oh !
cruel Ragotte ; my punishment is complete . ''
For a long time he bewailed his sad fate like this , and then , seeing that it was growing dark , and that still there was no sign of the Princess , he set out as fast as he could in the direction of the town .
When he reached the palace he asked for Miranda , but by this time everyone had heard the story of her adventures , and did not want her to go back again to the King of the Sheep , so they refused sternly to let him see her .
In vain he begged and prayed them to let him in ; though his entreaties might have melted hearts of stone they did not move the guards of the palace , and at last , quite broken-hearted , he fell dead at their feet .
In the meantime the King , who had not the least idea of the sad thing that was happening outside the gate of his palace , proposed to Miranda that she should be driven in her chariot all round the town , which was to be illuminated with thousands and thousands of torches , placed in windows and balconies , and in all the grand squares .
But what a sight met her eyes at the very entrance of the palace !
There lay her dear , kind sheep , silent and motionless , upon the pavement !
She threw herself out of the chariot and ran to him , crying bitterly , for she realized that her broken promise had cost him his life , and for a long , long time she was so unhappy that they thought she would have died too .
So you see that even a princess is not always happy -- especially if she forgets to keep her word ; and the greatest misfortunes often happen to people just as they think they have obtained their heart 's desires !

LITTLE THUMB There was , once upon a time , a man and his wife fagot-makers by trade , who had several children , all boys .
The eldest was but ten years old , and the youngest only seven .
They were very poor , and their seven children incommoded them greatly , because not one of them was able to earn his bread .
That which gave them yet more uneasiness was that the youngest was of a very puny constitution , and scarce ever spoke a word , which made them take that for stupidity which was a sign of good sense .
He was very little , and when born no bigger than one 's thumb , which made him be called Little Thumb .
The poor child bore the blame of whatsoever was done amiss in the house , and , guilty or not , was always in the wrong ; he was , notwithstanding , more cunning and had a far greater share of wisdom than all his brothers put together ; and , if he spake little , he heard and thought the more .
There happened now to come a very bad year , and the famine was so great that these poor people resolved to rid themselves of their children .
One evening , when they were all in bed and the fagot-maker was sitting with his wife at the fire , he said to her , with his heart ready to burst with grief : `` Thou seest plainly that we are not able to keep our children , and I can not see them starve to death before my face ; I am resolved to lose them in the wood to-morrow , which may very easily be done ; for , while they are busy in tying up fagots , we may run away , and leave them , without their taking any notice . ''
`` Ah ! ''
cried his wife ; `` and canst thou thyself have the heart to take thy children out along with thee on purpose to lose them ? ''
In vain did her husband represent to her their extreme poverty : she would not consent to it ; she was indeed poor , but she was their mother .
However , having considered what a grief it would be to her to see them perish with hunger , she at last consented , and went to bed all in tears .
Little Thumb heard every word that had been spoken ; for observing , as he lay in his bed , that they were talking very busily , he got up softly , and hid himself under his father 's stool , that he might hear what they said without being seen .
He went to bed again , but did not sleep a wink all the rest of the night , thinking on what he had to do .
He got up early in the morning , and went to the river-side , where he filled his pockets full of small white pebbles , and then returned home .
They all went abroad , but Little Thumb never told his brothers one syllable of what he knew .
They went into a very thick forest , where they could not see one another at ten paces distance .
The fagot-maker began to cut wood , and the children to gather up the sticks to make fagots .
Their father and mother , seeing them busy at their work , got away from them insensibly , and ran away from them all at once , along a by-way through the winding bushes .
When the children saw they were left alone , they began to cry as loud as they could .
Little Thumb let them cry on , knowing very well how to get home again , for , as he came , he took care to drop all along the way the little white pebbles he had in his pockets .
Then he said to them : `` Be not afraid , brothers ; father and mother have left us here , but I will lead you home again , only follow me . ''
They did so , and he brought them home by the very same way they came into the forest .
They dared not go in , but sat themselves down at the door , listening to what their father and mother were saying .
The very moment the fagot-maker and his wife reached home the lord of the manor sent them ten crowns , which he had owed them a long while , and which they never expected .
This gave them new life , for the poor people were almost famished .
The fagot-maker sent his wife immediately to the butcher 's .
As it was a long while since they had eaten a bit , she bought thrice as much meat as would sup two people .
When they had eaten , the woman said : `` Alas !
where are now our poor children ?
they would make a good feast of what we have left here ; but it was you , William , who had a mind to lose them : I told you we should repent of it .
What are they now doing in the forest ?
Alas !
dear God , the wolves have perhaps already eaten them up ; thou art very inhuman thus to have lost thy children . ''
The fagot-maker grew at last quite out of patience , for she repeated it above twenty times , that they should repent of it , and that she was in the right of it for so saying .
He threatened to beat her if she did not hold her tongue .
It was not that the fagot-maker was not , perhaps , more vexed than his wife , but that she teased him , and that he was of the humor of a great many others , who love wives to speak well , but think those very importunate who are continually doing so .
She was half-drowned in tears , crying out : `` Alas !
where are now my children , my poor children ? ''
She spoke this so very loud that the children , who were at the gate , began to cry out all together : `` Here we are !
Here we are ! ''
She ran immediately to open the door , and said , hugging them : `` I am glad to see you , my dear children ; you are very hungry and weary ; and my poor Peter , thou art horribly bemired ; come in and let me clean thee . ''
Now , you must know that Peter was her eldest son , whom she loved above all the rest , because he was somewhat carroty , as she herself was .
They sat down to supper , and ate with such a good appetite as pleased both father and mother , whom they acquainted how frightened they were in the forest , speaking almost always all together .
The good folks were extremely glad to see their children once more at home , and this joy continued while the ten crowns lasted ; but , when the money was all gone , they fell again into their former uneasiness , and resolved to lose them again ; and , that they might be the surer of doing it , to carry them to a much greater distance than before .
They could not talk of this so secretly but they were overheard by Little Thumb , who made account to get out of this difficulty as well as the former ; but , though he got up very early in the morning to go and pick up some little pebbles , he was disappointed , for he found the house-door double-locked , and was at a stand what to do .
When their father had given each of them a piece of bread for their breakfast , Little Thumb fancied he might make use of this instead of the pebbles by throwing it in little bits all along the way they should pass ; and so he put the bread in his pocket .
Their father and mother brought them into the thickest and most obscure part of the forest , when , stealing away into a by-path , they there left them .
Little Thumb was not very uneasy at it , for he thought he could easily find the way again by means of his bread , which he had scattered all along as he came ; but he was very much surprised when he could not find so much as one crumb ; the birds had come and had eaten it up , every bit .
They were now in great affliction , for the farther they went the more they were out of their way , and were more and more bewildered in the forest .
Night now came on , and there arose a terribly high wind , which made them dreadfully afraid .
They fancied they heard on every side of them the howling of wolves coming to eat them up .
They scarce dared to speak or turn their heads .
After this , it rained very hard , which wetted them to the skin ; their feet slipped at every step they took , and they fell into the mire , whence they got up in a very dirty pickle ; their hands were quite benumbed .
Little Thumb climbed up to the top of a tree , to see if he could discover anything ; and having turned his head about on every side , he saw at last a glimmering light , like that of a candle , but a long way from the forest .
He came down , and , when upon the ground , he could see it no more , which grieved him sadly .
However , having walked for some time with his brothers toward that side on which he had seen the light , he perceived it again as he came out of the wood .
They came at last to the house where this candle was , not without an abundance of fear : for very often they lost sight of it , which happened every time they came into a bottom .
They knocked at the door , and a good woman came and opened it ; she asked them what they would have .
Little Thumb told her they were poor children who had been lost in the forest , and desired to lodge there for God 's sake .
The woman , seeing them so very pretty , began to weep , and said to them : `` Alas !
poor babies ; whither are ye come ?
Do ye know that this house belongs to a cruel ogre who eats up little children ? ''
`` Ah !
dear madam , '' answered Little Thumb -LRB- who trembled every joint of him , as well as his brothers -RRB- , `` what shall we do ?
To be sure the wolves of the forest will devour us to-night if you refuse us to lie here ; and so we would rather the gentleman should eat us ; and perhaps he may take pity upon us , especially if you please to beg it of him . ''
The Ogre 's wife , who believed she could conceal them from her husband till morning , let them come in , and brought them to warm themselves at a very good fire ; for there was a whole sheep upon the spit , roasting for the Ogre 's supper .
As they began to be a little warm they heard three or four great raps at the door ; this was the Ogre , who had come home .
Upon this she hid them under the bed and went to open the door .
The Ogre presently asked if supper was ready and the wine drawn , and then sat himself down to table .
The sheep was as yet all raw and bloody ; but he liked it the better for that .
He sniffed about to the right and left , saying : `` I smell fresh meat . ''
`` What you smell so , '' said his wife , `` must be the calf which I have just now killed and flayed . ''
`` I smell fresh meat , I tell thee once more , '' replied the Ogre , looking crossly at his wife ; `` and there is something here which I do not understand . ''
As he spoke these words he got up from the table and went directly to the bed .
`` Ah , ah ! ''
said he ; `` I see then how thou wouldst cheat me , thou cursed woman ; I know not why I do not eat thee up too , but it is well for thee that thou art a tough old carrion .
Here is good game , which comes very quickly to entertain three ogres of my acquaintance who are to pay me a visit in a day or two . ''
With that he dragged them out from under the bed one by one .
The poor children fell upon their knees , and begged his pardon ; but they had to do with one of the most cruel ogres in the world , who , far from having any pity on them , had already devoured them with his eyes , and told his wife they would be delicate eating when tossed up with good savory sauce .
He then took a great knife , and , coming up to these poor children , whetted it upon a great whet-stone which he held in his left hand .
He had already taken hold of one of them when his wife said to him : `` Why need you do it now ?
Is it not time enough to-morrow ? ''
`` Hold your prating , '' said the Ogre ; `` they will eat the tenderer .
`` But you have so much meat already , '' replied his wife , `` you have no occasion ; here are a calf , two sheep , and half a hog . ''
`` That is true , '' said the Ogre ; `` give them their belly full that they may not fall away , and put them to bed . ''
The good woman was overjoyed at this , and gave them a good supper ; but they were so much afraid they could not eat a bit .
As for the Ogre , he sat down again to drink , being highly pleased that he had got wherewithal to treat his friends .
He drank a dozen glasses more than ordinary , which got up into his head and obliged him to go to bed .
The Ogre had seven daughters , all little children , and these young ogresses had all of them very fine complexions , because they used to eat fresh meat like their father ; but they had little gray eyes , quite round , hooked noses , and very long sharp teeth , standing at a good distance from each other .
They were not as yet over and above mischievous , but they promised very fair for it , for they had already bitten little children , that they might suck their blood .
They had been put to bed early , with every one a crown of gold upon her head .
There was in the same chamber a bed of the like bigness , and it was into this bed the Ogre 's wife put the seven little boys , after which she went to bed to her husband .
Little Thumb , who had observed that the Ogre 's daughters had crowns of gold upon their heads , and was afraid lest the Ogre should repent his not killing them , got up about midnight , and , taking his brothers ' bonnets and his own , went very softly and put them upon the heads of the seven little ogresses , after having taken off their crowns of gold , which he put upon his own head and his brothers ' , that the Ogre might take them for his daughters , and his daughters for the little boys whom he wanted to kill .
All this succeeded according to his desire ; for , the Ogre waking about midnight , and sorry that he deferred to do that till morning which he might have done over-night , threw himself hastily out of bed , and , taking his great knife , `` Let us see , '' said he , `` how our little rogues do , and not make two jobs of the matter . ''
He then went up , groping all the way , into his daughters ' chamber , and , coming to the bed where the little boys lay , and who were every soul of them fast asleep , except Little Thumb , who was terribly afraid when he found the Ogre fumbling about his head , as he had done about his brothers ' , the Ogre , feeling the golden crowns , said : `` I should have made a fine piece of work of it , truly ; I find I drank too much last night . ''
Then he went to the bed where the girls lay ; and , having found the boys ' little bonnets , `` Ah ! ''
said he , `` my merry lads , are you there ?
Let us work as we ought . ''
And saying these words , without more ado , he cut the throats of all his seven daughters .
Well pleased with what he had done , he went to bed again to his wife .
So soon as Little Thumb heard the Ogre snore , he waked his brothers , and bade them all put on their clothes presently and follow him .
They stole down softly into the garden , and got over the wall .
They kept running about all night , and trembled all the while , without knowing which way they went .
The Ogre , when he awoke , said to his wife : `` Go upstairs and dress those young rascals who came here last night . ''
The wife was very much surprised at this goodness of her husband , not dreaming after what manner she should dress them ; but , thinking that he had ordered her to go and put on their clothes , she went up , and was strangely astonished when she perceived her seven daughters killed , and weltering in their blood .
She fainted away , for this is the first expedient almost all women find in such cases .
The Ogre , fearing his wife would be too long in doing what he had ordered , went up himself to help her .
He was no less amazed than his wife at this frightful spectacle .
`` Ah !
what have I done ? ''
cried he .
`` The wretches shall pay for it , and that instantly . ''
He threw a pitcher of water upon his wife 's face , and , having brought her to herself , said : `` Give me quickly my boots of seven leagues , that I may go and catch them . ''
He went out , and , having run over a vast deal of ground , both on this side and that , he came at last into the very road where the poor children were , and not above a hundred paces from their father 's house .
They espied the Ogre , who went at one step from mountain to mountain , and over rivers as easily as the narrowest kennels .
Little Thumb , seeing a hollow rock near the place where they were , made his brothers hide themselves in it , and crowded into it himself , minding always what would become of the Ogre .
The Ogre , who found himself much tired with his long and fruitless journey -LRB- for these boots of seven leagues greatly fatigued the wearer -RRB- , had a great mind to rest himself , and , by chance , went to sit down upon the rock where the little boys had hid themselves .
As it was impossible he could be more weary than he was , he fell asleep , and , after reposing himself some time , began to snore so frightfully that the poor children were no less afraid of him than when he held up his great knife and was going to cut their throats .
Little Thumb was not so much frightened as his brothers , and told them that they should run away immediately toward home while the Ogre was asleep so soundly , and that they should not be in any pain about him .
They took his advice , and got home presently .
Little Thumb came up to the Ogre , pulled off his boots gently and put them on his own legs .
The boots were very long and large , but , as they were fairies , they had the gift of becoming big and little , according to the legs of those who wore them ; so that they fitted his feet and legs as well as if they had been made on purpose for him .
He went immediately to the Ogre 's house , where he saw his wife crying bitterly for the loss of the Ogre 's murdered daughters .
`` Your husband , '' said Little Thumb , `` is in very great danger , being taken by a gang of thieves , who have sworn to kill him if he does not give them all his gold and silver .
The very moment they held their daggers at his throat he perceived me , and desired me to come and tell you the condition he is in , and that you should give me whatsoever he has of value , without retaining any one thing ; for otherwise they will kill him without mercy ; and , as his case is very pressing , he desired me to make use -LRB- you see I have them on -RRB- of his boots , that I might make the more haste and to show you that I do not impose upon you . ''
The good woman , being sadly frightened , gave him all she had : for this Ogre was a very good husband , though he used to eat up little children .
Little Thumb , having thus got all the Ogre 's money , came home to his father 's house , where he was received with abundance of joy .
There are many people who do not agree in this circumstance , and pretend that Little Thumb never robbed the Ogre at all , and that he only thought he might very justly , and with a safe conscience , take off his boots of seven leagues , because he made no other use of them but to run after little children .
These folks affirm that they are very well assured of this , and the more as having drunk and eaten often at the fagot-maker 's house .
They aver that when Little Thumb had taken off the Ogre 's boots he went to Court , where he was informed that they were very much in pain about a certain army , which was two hundred leagues off , and the success of a battle .
He went , say they , to the King , and told him that , if he desired it , he would bring him news from the army before night .
The King promised him a great sum of money upon that condition .
Little Thumb was as good as his word , and returned that very same night with the news ; and , this first expedition causing him to be known , he got whatever he pleased , for the King paid him very well for carrying his orders to the army .
After having for some time carried on the business of a messenger , and gained thereby great wealth , he went home to his father , where it was impossible to express the joy they were all in at his return .
He made the whole family very easy , bought places for his father and brothers , and , by that means , settled them very handsomely in the world , and , in the meantime , made his court to perfection .

THE FORTY THIEVES In a town in Persia there dwelt two brothers , one named Cassim , the other Ali Baba .
Cassim was married to a rich wife and lived in plenty , while Ali Baba had to maintain his wife and children by cutting wood in a neighboring forest and selling it in the town .
One day , when Ali Baba was in the forest , he saw a troop of men on horseback , coming toward him in a cloud of dust .
He was afraid they were robbers , and climbed into a tree for safety .
When they came up to him and dismounted , he counted forty of them .
They unbridled their horses and tied them to trees .
The finest man among them , whom Ali Baba took to be their captain , went a little way among some bushes , and said : `` Open , Sesame ! ''
-LRB- 1 -RRB- so plainly that Ali Baba heard him .
A door opened in the rocks , and having made the troop go in , he followed them , and the door shut again of itself .
They stayed some time inside , and Ali Baba , fearing they might come out and catch him , was forced to sit patiently in the tree .
At last the door opened again , and the Forty Thieves came out .
As the Captain went in last he came out first , and made them all pass by him ; he then closed the door , saying : `` Shut , Sesame ! ''
Every man bridled his horse and mounted , the Captain put himself at their head , and they returned as they came .
-LRB- 1 -RRB- Sesame is a kind of grain .
Then Ali Baba climbed down and went to the door concealed among the bushes , and said : `` Open , Sesame ! ''
and it flew open .
Ali Baba , who expected a dull , dismal place , was greatly surprised to find it large and well lighted , hollowed by the hand of man in the form of a vault , which received the light from an opening in the ceiling .
He saw rich bales of merchandise -- silk , stuff-brocades , all piled together , and gold and silver in heaps , and money in leather purses .
He went in and the door shut behind him .
He did not look at the silver , but brought out as many bags of gold as he thought his asses , which were browsing outside , could carry , loaded them with the bags , and hid it all with fagots .
Using the words : `` Shut , Sesame ! ''
he closed the door and went home .
Then he drove his asses into the yard , shut the gates , carried the money-bags to his wife , and emptied them out before her .
He bade her keep the secret , and he would go and bury the gold .
`` Let me first measure it , '' said his wife .
`` I will go borrow a measure of someone , while you dig the hole . ''
So she ran to the wife of Cassim and borrowed a measure .
Knowing Ali Baba 's poverty , the sister was curious to find out what sort of grain his wife wished to measure , and artfully put some suet at the bottom of the measure .
Ali Baba 's wife went home and set the measure on the heap of gold , and filled it and emptied it often , to her great content .
She then carried it back to her sister , without noticing that a piece of gold was sticking to it , which Cassim 's wife perceived directly her back was turned .
She grew very curious , and said to Cassim when he came home : `` Cassim , your brother is richer than you .
He does not count his money , he measures it . ''
He begged her to explain this riddle , which she did by showing him the piece of money and telling him where she found it .
Then Cassim grew so envious that he could not sleep , and went to his brother in the morning before sunrise .
`` Ali Baba , '' he said , showing him the gold piece , `` you pretend to be poor and yet you measure gold . ''
By this Ali Baba perceived that through his wife 's folly Cassim and his wife knew their secret , so he confessed all and offered Cassim a share .
`` That I expect , '' said Cassim ; `` but I must know where to find the treasure , otherwise I will discover all , and you will lose all . ''
Ali Baba , more out of kindness than fear , told him of the cave , and the very words to use .
Cassim left Ali Baba , meaning to be beforehand with him and get the treasure for himself .
He rose early next morning , and set out with ten mules loaded with great chests .
He soon found the place , and the door in the rock .
He said : `` Open , Sesame ! ''
and the door opened and shut behind him .
He could have feasted his eyes all day on the treasures , but he now hastened to gather together as much of it as possible ; but when he was ready to go he could not remember what to say for thinking of his great riches .
Instead of `` Sesame , '' he said : `` Open , Barley ! ''
and the door remained fast .
He named several different sorts of grain , all but the right one , and the door still stuck fast .
He was so frightened at the danger he was in that he had as much forgotten the word as if he had never heard it .
About noon the robbers returned to their cave , and saw Cassim 's mules roving about with great chests on their backs .
This gave them the alarm ; they drew their sabres , and went to the door , which opened on their Captain 's saying : `` Open , Sesame ! ''
Cassim , who had heard the trampling of their horses ' feet , resolved to sell his life dearly , so when the door opened he leaped out and threw the Captain down .
In vain , however , for the robbers with their sabres soon killed him .
On entering the cave they saw all the bags laid ready , and could not imagine how anyone had got in without knowing their secret .
They cut Cassim 's body into four quarters , and nailed them up inside the cave , in order to frighten anyone who should venture in , and went away in search of more treasure .
As night drew on Cassim 's wife grew very uneasy , and ran to her brother-in-law , and told him where her husband had gone .
Ali Baba did his best to comfort her , and set out to the forest in search of Cassim .
The first thing he saw on entering the cave was his dead brother .
Full of horror , he put the body on one of his asses , and bags of gold on the other two , and , covering all with some fagots , returned home .
He drove the two asses laden with gold into his own yard , and led the other to Cassim 's house .
The door was opened by the slave Morgiana , whom he knew to be both brave and cunning .
Unloading the ass , he said to her : `` This is the body of your master , who has been murdered , but whom we must bury as though he had died in his bed .
I will speak with you again , but now tell your mistress I am come . ''
The wife of Cassim , on learning the fate of her husband , broke out into cries and tears , but Ali Baba offered to take her to live with him and his wife if she would promise to keep his counsel and leave everything to Morgiana ; whereupon she agreed , and dried her eyes .
Morgiana , meanwhile , sought an apothecary and asked him for some lozenges .
`` My poor master , '' she said , `` can neither eat nor speak , and no one knows what his distemper is . ''
She carried home the lozenges and returned next day weeping , and asked for an essence only given to those just about to die .
Thus , in the evening , no one was surprised to hear the wretched shrieks and cries of Cassim 's wife and Morgiana , telling everyone that Cassim was dead .
The day after Morgiana went to an old cobbler near the gates of the town who opened his stall early , put a piece of gold in his hand , and bade him follow her with his needle and thread .
Having bound his eyes with a handkerchief , she took him to the room where the body lay , pulled off the bandage , and bade him sew the quarters together , after which she covered his eyes again and led him home .
Then they buried Cassim , and Morgiana his slave followed him to the grave , weeping and tearing her hair , while Cassim 's wife stayed at home uttering lamentable cries .
Next day she went to live with Ali Baba , who gave Cassim 's shop to his eldest son .
The Forty Thieves , on their return to the cave , were much astonished to find Cassim 's body gone and some of their money-bags .
`` We are certainly discovered , '' said the Captain , `` and shall be undone if we can not find out who it is that knows our secret .
Two men must have known it ; we have killed one , we must now find the other .
To this end one of you who is bold and artful must go into the city dressed as a traveler , and discover whom we have killed , and whether men talk of the strange manner of his death .
If the messenger fails he must lose his life , lest we be betrayed . ''
One of the thieves started up and offered to do this , and after the rest had highly commended him for his bravery he disguised himself , and happened to enter the town at daybreak , just by Baba Mustapha 's stall .
The thief bade him good-day , saying : `` Honest man , how can you possibly see to stitch at your age ? ''
`` Old as I am , '' replied the cobbler , `` I have very good eyes , and will you believe me when I tell you that I sewed a dead body together in a place where I had less light than I have now . ''
The robber was overjoyed at his good fortune , and , giving him a piece of gold , desired to be shown the house where he stitched up the dead body .
At first Mustapha refused , saying that he had been blindfolded ; but when the robber gave him another piece of gold he began to think he might remember the turnings if blindfolded as before .
This means succeeded ; the robber partly led him , and was partly guided by him , right in front of Cassim 's house , the door of which the robber marked with a piece of chalk .
Then , well pleased , he bade farewell to Baba Mustapha and returned to the forest .
By and by Morgiana , going out , saw the mark the robber had made , quickly guessed that some mischief was brewing , and fetching a piece of chalk marked two or three doors on each side , without saying anything to her master or mistress .
The thief , meantime , told his comrades of his discovery .
The Captain thanked him , and bade him show him the house he had marked .
But when they came to it they saw that five or six of the houses were chalked in the same manner .
The guide was so confounded that he knew not what answer to make , and when they returned he was at once beheaded for having failed .
Another robber was dispatched , and , having won over Baba Mustapha , marked the house in red chalk ; but Morgiana being again too clever for them , the second messenger was put to death also .
The Captain now resolved to go himself , but , wiser than the others , he did not mark the house , but looked at it so closely that he could not fail to remember it .
He returned , and ordered his men to go into the neighboring villages and buy nineteen mules , and thirty-eight leather jars , all empty except one , which was full of oil .
The Captain put one of his men , fully armed , into each , rubbing the outside of the jars with oil from the full vessel .
Then the nineteen mules were loaded with thirty-seven robbers in jars , and the jar of oil , and reached the town by dusk .
The Captain stopped his mules in front of Ali Baba 's house , and said to Ali Baba , who was sitting outside for coolness : `` I have brought some oil from a distance to sell at to-morrow 's market , but it is now so late that I know not where to pass the night , unless you will do me the favor to take me in . ''
Though Ali Baba had seen the Captain of the robbers in the forest , he did not recognize him in the disguise of an oil merchant .
He bade him welcome , opened his gates for the mules to enter , and went to Morgiana to bid her prepare a bed and supper for his guest .
He brought the stranger into his hall , and after they had supped went again to speak to Morgiana in the kitchen , while the Captain went into the yard under pretense of seeing after his mules , but really to tell his men what to do .
Beginning at the first jar and ending at the last , he said to each man : `` As soon as I throw some stones from the window of the chamber where I lie , cut the jars open with your knives and come out , and I will be with you in a trice . ''
He returned to the house , and Morgiana led him to his chamber .
She then told Abdallah , her fellow-slave , to set on the pot to make some broth for her master , who had gone to bed .
Meanwhile her lamp went out , and she had no more oil in the house .
`` Do not be uneasy , '' said Abdallah ; `` go into the yard and take some out of one of those jars . ''
Morgiana thanked him for his advice , took the oil pot , and went into the yard .
When she came to the first jar the robber inside said softly : `` Is it time ? ''
Any other slave but Morgiana , on finding a man in the jar instead of the oil she wanted , would have screamed and made a noise ; but she , knowing the danger her master was in , bethought herself of a plan , and answered quietly : `` Not yet , but presently . ''
She went to all the jars , giving the same answer , till she came to the jar of oil .
She now saw that her master , thinking to entertain an oil merchant , had let thirty-eight robbers into his house .
She filled her oil pot , went back to the kitchen , and , having lit her lamp , went again to the oil jar and filled a large kettle full of oil .
When it boiled she went and poured enough oil into every jar to stifle and kill the robber inside .
When this brave deed was done she went back to the kitchen , put out the fire and the lamp , and waited to see what would happen .
In a quarter of an hour the Captain of the robbers awoke , got up , and opened the window .
As all seemed quiet , he threw down some little pebbles which hit the jars .
He listened , and as none of his men seemed to stir he grew uneasy , and went down into the yard .
On going to the first jar and saying , `` Are you asleep ? ''
he smelt the hot boiled oil , and knew at once that his plot to murder Ali Baba and his household had been discovered .
He found all the gang was dead , and , missing the oil out of the last jar , became aware of the manner of their death .
He then forced the lock of a door leading into a garden , and climbing over several walls made his escape .
Morgiana heard and saw all this , and , rejoicing at her success , went to bed and fell asleep .
At daybreak Ali Baba arose , and , seeing the oil jars still there , asked why the merchant had not gone with his mules .
Morgiana bade him look in the first jar and see if there was any oil .
Seeing a man , he started back in terror .
`` Have no fear , '' said Morgiana ; `` the man can not harm you : he is dead . ''
Ali Baba , when he had recovered somewhat from his astonishment , asked what had become of the merchant .
`` Merchant ! ''
said she , `` he is no more a merchant than I am ! ''
and she told him the whole story , assuring him that it was a plot of the robbers of the forest , of whom only three were left , and that the white and red chalk marks had something to do with it .
Ali Baba at once gave Morgiana her freedom , saying that he owed her his life .
They then buried the bodies in Ali Baba 's garden , while the mules were sold in the market by his slaves .
The Captain returned to his lonely cave , which seemed frightful to him without his lost companions , and firmly resolved to avenge them by killing Ali Baba .
He dressed himself carefully , and went into the town , where he took lodgings in an inn .
In the course of a great many journeys to the forest he carried away many rich stuffs and much fine linen , and set up a shop opposite that of Ali Baba 's son .
He called himself Cogia Hassan , and as he was both civil and well dressed he soon made friends with Ali Baba 's son , and through him with Ali Baba , whom he was continually asking to sup with him .
Ali Baba , wishing to return his kindness , invited him into his house and received him smiling , thanking him for his kindness to his son .
When the merchant was about to take his leave Ali Baba stopped him , saying : `` Where are you going , sir , in such haste ?
Will you not stay and sup with me ? ''
The merchant refused , saying that he had a reason ; and , on Ali Baba 's asking him what that was , he replied : `` It is , sir , that I can eat no victuals that have any salt in them . ''
`` If that is all , '' said Ali Baba , `` let me tell you that there shall be no salt in either the meat or the bread that we eat to-night . ''
He went to give this order to Morgiana , who was much surprised .
`` Who is this man , '' she said , `` who eats no salt with his meat ? ''
`` He is an honest man , Morgiana , '' returned her master ; `` therefore do as I bid you . ''
But she could not withstand a desire to see this strange man , so she helped Abdallah to carry up the dishes , and saw in a moment that Cogia Hassan was the robber Captain , and carried a dagger under his garment .
`` I am not surprised , '' she said to herself , `` that this wicked man , who intends to kill my master , will eat no salt with him ; but I will hinder his plans . ''
She sent up the supper by Abdallah , while she made ready for one of the boldest acts that could be thought on .
When the dessert had been served , Cogia Hassan was left alone with Ali Baba and his son , whom he thought to make drunk and then to murder them .
Morgiana , meanwhile , put on a head-dress like a dancing-girl 's , and clasped a girdle round her waist , from which hung a dagger with a silver hilt , and said to Abdallah : `` Take your tabor , and let us go and divert our master and his guest . ''
Abdallah took his tabor and played before Morgiana until they came to the door , where Abdallah stopped playing and Morgiana made a low courtesy .
`` Come in , Morgiana , '' said Ali Baba , `` and let Cogia Hassan see what you can do '' ; and , turning to Cogia Hassan , he said : `` She 's my slave and my housekeeper . ''
Cogia Hassan was by no means pleased , for he feared that his chance of killing Ali Baba was gone for the present ; but he pretended great eagerness to see Morgiana , and Abdallah began to play and Morgiana to dance .
After she had performed several dances she drew her dagger and made passes with it , sometimes pointing it at her own breast , sometimes at her master 's , as if it were part of the dance .
Suddenly , out of breath , she snatched the tabor from Abdallah with her left hand , and , holding the dagger in her right hand , held out the tabor to her master .
Ali Baba and his son put a piece of gold into it , and Cogia Hassan , seeing that she was coming to him , pulled out his purse to make her a present , but while he was putting his hand into it Morgiana plunged the dagger into his heart .
`` Unhappy girl ! ''
cried Ali Baba and his son , `` what have you done to ruin us ? ''
`` It was to preserve you , master , not to ruin you , '' answered Morgiana .
`` See here , '' opening the false merchant 's garment and showing the dagger ; `` see what an enemy you have entertained !
Remember , he would eat no salt with you , and what more would you have ?
Look at him !
he is both the false oil merchant and the Captain of the Forty Thieves . ''
Ali Baba was so grateful to Morgiana for thus saving his life that he offered her to his son in marriage , who readily consented , and a few days after the wedding was celebrated with greatest splendor .
At the end of a year Ali Baba , hearing nothing of the two remaining robbers , judged they were dead , and set out to the cave .
The door opened on his saying : `` Open Sesame ! ''
He went in , and saw that nobody had been there since the Captain left it .
He brought away as much gold as he could carry , and returned to town .
He told his son the secret of the cave , which his son handed down in his turn , so the children and grandchildren of Ali Baba were rich to the end of their lives .
-LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- 1 -RRB- Arabian Nights .
HANSEL AND GRETTEL Once upon a time there dwelt on the outskirts of a large forest a poor woodcutter with his wife and two children ; the boy was called Hansel and the girl Grettel .
He had always little enough to live on , and once , when there was a great famine in the land , he could n't even provide them with daily bread .
One night , as he was tossing about in bed , full of cares and worry , he sighed and said to his wife : `` What 's to become of us ?
how are we to support our poor children , now that we have nothing more for ourselves ? ''
`` I 'll tell you what , husband , '' answered the woman ; `` early to-morrow morning we 'll take the children out into the thickest part of the wood ; there we shall light a fire for them and give them each a piece of bread ; then we 'll go on to our work and leave them alone .
They wo n't be able to find their way home , and we shall thus be rid of them . ''
`` No , wife , '' said her husband , `` that I wo n't do ; how could I find it in my heart to leave my children alone in the wood ?
The wild beasts would soon come and tear them to pieces . ''
`` Oh !
you fool , '' said she , `` then we must all four die of hunger , and you may just as well go and plane the boards for our coffins '' ; and she left him no peace till he consented .
`` But I ca n't help feeling sorry for the poor children , '' added the husband .
The children , too , had not been able to sleep for hunger , and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father .
Grettel wept bitterly and spoke to Hansel : `` Now it 's all up with us . ''
`` No , no , Grettel , '' said Hansel , `` do n't fret yourself ; I 'll be able to find a way to escape , no fear . ''
And when the old people had fallen asleep he got up , slipped on his little coat , opened the back door and stole out .
The moon was shining clearly , and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like bits of silver .
Hansel bent down and filled his pocket with as many of them as he could cram in .
Then he went back and said to Grettel : `` Be comforted , my dear little sister , and go to sleep : God will not desert us '' ; and he lay down in bed again .
At daybreak , even before the sun was up , the woman came and woke the two children : `` Get up , you lie-abeds , we 're all going to the forest to fetch wood . ''
She gave them each a bit of bread and said : `` There 's something for your luncheon , but do n't you eat it up before , for it 's all you 'll get . ''
Grettel took the bread under her apron , as Hansel had the stones in his pocket .
Then they all set out together on the way to the forest .
After they had walked for a little , Hansel stood still and looked back at the house , and this maneuver he repeated again and again .
His father observed him , and said : `` Hansel , what are you gazing at there , and why do you always remain behind ?
Take care , and do n't lose your footing . ''
`` Oh !
father , '' said Hansel , `` I am looking back at my white kitten , which is sitting on the roof , waving me a farewell . ''
The woman exclaimed : `` What a donkey you are !
that is n't your kitten , that 's the morning sun shining on the chimney . ''
But Hansel had not looked back at his kitten , but had always dropped one of the white pebbles out of his pocket on to the path .
When they had reached the middle of the forest the father said : `` Now , children , go and fetch a lot of wood , and I 'll light a fire that you may not feel cold . ''
Hansel and Grettel heaped up brushwood till they had made a pile nearly the size of a small hill .
The brushwood was set fire to , and when the flames leaped high the woman said : `` Now lie down at the fire , children , and rest yourselves : we are going into the forest to cut down wood ; when we 've finished we 'll come back and fetch you . ''
Hansel and Grettel sat down beside the fire , and at midday ate their little bits of bread .
They heard the strokes of the axe , so they thought their father was quite near .
But it was no axe they heard , but a bough he had tied on a dead tree , and that was blown about by the wind .
And when they had sat for a long time their eyes closed with fatigue , and they fell fast asleep .
When they awoke at last it was pitch dark .
Grettel began to cry , and said : `` How are we ever to get out of the wood ? ''
But Hansel comforted her .
`` Wait a bit , '' he said , `` till the moon is up , and then we 'll find our way sure enough . ''
And when the full moon had risen he took his sister by the hand and followed the pebbles , which shone like new threepenny bits , and showed them the path .
They walked on through the night , and at daybreak reached their father 's house again .
They knocked at the door , and when the woman opened it she exclaimed : `` You naughty children , what a time you 've slept in the wood !
we thought you were never going to come back . ''
But the father rejoiced , for his conscience had reproached him for leaving his children behind by themselves .
Not long afterward there was again great dearth in the land , and the children heard their mother address their father thus in bed one night : `` Everything is eaten up once more ; we have only half a loaf in the house , and when that 's done it 's all up with us .
The children must be got rid of ; we 'll lead them deeper into the wood this time , so that they wo n't be able to find their way out again .
There is no other way of saving ourselves . ''
The man 's heart smote him heavily , and he thought : `` Surely it would be better to share the last bite with one 's children ! ''
But his wife would n't listen to his arguments , and did nothing but scold and reproach him .
If a man yields once he 's done for , and so , because he had given in the first time , he was forced to do so the second .
But the children were awake , and had heard the conversation .
When the old people were asleep Hansel got up , and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles again , as he had done the first time ; but the woman had barred the door , and Hansel could n't get out .
But he consoled his little sister , and said : `` Do n't cry , Grettel , and sleep peacefully , for God is sure to help us . ''
At early dawn the woman came and made the children get up .
They received their bit of bread , but it was even smaller than the time before .
On the way to the wood Hansel crumbled it in his pocket , and every few minutes he stood still and dropped a crumb on the ground .
`` Hansel , what are you stopping and looking about you for ? ''
said the father .
`` I 'm looking back at my little pigeon , which is sitting on the roof waving me a farewell , '' answered Hansel .
`` Fool ! ''
said the wife ; `` that is n't your pigeon , it 's the morning sun glittering on the chimney . ''
But Hansel gradually threw all his crumbs on the path .
The woman led the children still deeper into the forest farther than they had ever been in their lives before .
Then a big fire was lit again , and the mother said : `` Just sit down there , children , and if you 're tired you can sleep a bit ; we 're going into the forest to cut down wood , and in the evening when we 're finished we 'll come back to fetch you . ''
At midday Grettel divided her bread with Hansel , for he had strewn his all along their path .
Then they fell asleep , and evening passed away , but nobody came to the poor children .
They did n't awake till it was pitch dark , and Hansel comforted his sister , saying : `` Only wait , Grettel , till the moon rises , then we shall see the bread-crumbs I scattered along the path ; they will show us the way back to the house . ''
When the moon appeared they got up , but they found no crumbs , for the thousands of birds that fly about the woods and fields had picked them all up .
`` Never mind , '' said Hansel to Grettel ; `` you 'll see we 'll find a way out '' ; but all the same they did not .
They wandered about the whole night , and the next day , from morning till evening , but they could not find a path out of the wood .
They were very hungry , too , for they had nothing to eat but a few berries they found growing on the ground .
And at last they were so tired that their legs refused to carry them any longer , so they lay down under a tree and fell fast asleep .
On the third morning after they had left their father 's house they set about their wandering again , but only got deeper and deeper into the wood , and now they felt that if help did not come to them soon they must perish .
At midday they saw a beautiful little snow-white bird sitting on a branch , which sang so sweetly that they stopped still and listened to it .
And when its song was finished it flapped its wings and flew on in front of them .
They followed it and came to a little house , on the roof of which it perched ; and when they came quite near they saw that the cottage was made of bread and roofed with cakes , while the window was made of transparent sugar .
`` Now we 'll set to , '' said Hansel , `` and have a regular blow-out .
-LRB- 1 -RRB- I 'll eat a bit of the roof , and you , Grettel , can eat some of the window , which you 'll find a sweet morsel . ''
Hansel stretched up his hand and broke off a little bit of the roof to see what it was like , and Grettel went to the casement and began to nibble at it .
Thereupon a shrill voice called out from the room inside : `` Nibble , nibble , little mouse , Who 's nibbling my house ? ''
The children answered : `` Tis Heaven 's own child , The tempest wild , '' and went on eating , without putting themselves about .
Hansel , who thoroughly appreciated the roof , tore down a big bit of it , while Grettel pushed out a whole round window-pane , and sat down the better to enjoy it .
Suddenly the door opened , and an ancient dame leaning on a staff hobbled out .
Hansel and Grettel were so terrified that they let what they had in their hands fall .
But the old woman shook her head and said : `` Oh , ho !
you dear children , who led you here ?
Just come in and stay with me , no ill shall befall you . ''
She took them both by the hand and let them into the house , and laid a most sumptuous dinner before them -- milk and sugared pancakes , with apples and nuts .
After they had finished , two beautiful little white beds were prepared for them , and when Hansel and Grettel lay down in them they felt as if they had got into heaven .
-LRB- 1 -RRB- He was a vulgar boy !
The old woman had appeared to be most friendly , but she was really an old witch who had waylaid the children , and had only built the little bread house in order to lure them in .
When anyone came into her power she killed , cooked , and ate him , and held a regular feast-day for the occasion .
Now witches have red eyes , and can not see far , but , like beasts , they have a keen sense of smell , and know when human beings pass by .
When Hansel and Grettel fell into her hands she laughed maliciously , and said jeeringly : `` I 've got them now ; they sha 'n' t escape me . ''
Early in the morning , before the children were awake , she rose up , and when she saw them both sleeping so peacefully , with their round rosy cheeks , she muttered to herself : `` That 'll be a dainty bite . ''
Then she seized Hansel with her bony hand and carried him into a little stable , and barred the door on him ; he might scream as much as he liked , it did him no good .
Then she went to Grettel , shook her till she awoke , and cried : `` Get up , you lazy-bones , fetch water and cook something for your brother .
When he 's fat I 'll eat him up . ''
Grettel began to cry bitterly , but it was of no use ; she had to do what the wicked witch bade her .
So the best food was cooked for poor Hansel , but Grettel got nothing but crab-shells .
Every morning the old woman hobbled out to the stable and cried : `` Hansel , put out your finger , that I may feel if you are getting fat . ''
But Hansel always stretched out a bone , and the old dame , whose eyes were dim , could n't see it , and thinking always it was Hansel 's finger , wondered why he fattened so slowly .
When four weeks had passed and Hansel still remained thin , she lost patience and determined to wait no longer .
`` Hi , Grettel , '' she called to the girl , `` be quick and get some water .
Hansel may be fat or thin , I 'm going to kill him to-morrow and cook him . ''
Oh !
how the poor little sister sobbed as she carried the water , and how the tears rolled down her cheeks !
`` Kind heaven help us now ! ''
she cried ; `` if only the wild beasts in the wood had eaten us , then at least we should have died together . ''
`` Just hold your peace , '' said the old hag ; `` it wo n't help you . ''
Early in the morning Grettel had to go out and hang up the kettle full of water , and light the fire .
`` First we 'll bake , '' said the old dame ; `` I 've heated the oven already and kneaded the dough . ''
She pushed Grettel out to the oven , from which fiery flames were already issuing .
`` Creep in , '' said the witch , `` and see if it 's properly heated , so that we can shove in the bread . ''
For when she had got Grettel in she meant to close the oven and let the girl bake , that she might eat her up too .
But Grettel perceived her intention , and said : `` I do n't know how I 'm to do it ; how do I get in ? ''
`` You silly goose ! ''
said the hag , `` the opening is big enough ; see , I could get in myself , '' and she crawled toward it , and poked her head into the oven .
Then Grettel gave her a shove that sent her right in , shut the iron door , and drew the bolt .
Gracious !
how she yelled , it was quite horrible ; but Grettel fled , and the wretched old woman was left to perish miserably .
Grettel flew straight to Hansel , opened the little stable-door , and cried : `` Hansel , we are free ; the old witch is dead . ''
Then Hansel sprang like a bird out of a cage when the door is opened .
How they rejoiced , and fell on each other 's necks , and jumped for joy , and kissed one another !
And as they had no longer any cause for fear , they went in the old hag 's house , and here they found , in every corner of the room , boxes with pearls and precious stones .
`` These are even better than pebbles , '' said Hansel , and crammed his pockets full of them ; and Grettel said : `` I too will bring something home , '' and she filled her apron full .
`` But now , '' said Hansel , `` let 's go and get well away from the witch 's wood . ''
When they had wandered about for some hours they came to a big lake .
`` We ca n't get over , '' said Hansel ; `` I see no bridge of any sort or kind . ''
`` Yes , and there 's no ferry-boat either , '' answered Grettel ; `` but look , there swims a white duck ; if I ask her she 'll help us over , '' and she called out : `` Here are two children , mournful very , Seeing neither bridge nor ferry ; Take us upon your white back , And row us over , quack , quack ! ''
The duck swam toward them , and Hansel got on her back and bade his little sister sit beside him .
`` No , '' answered Grettel , `` we should be too heavy a load for the duck : she shall carry us across separately . ''
The good bird did this , and when they were landed safely on the other side , and had gone for a while , the wood became more and more familiar to them , and at length they saw their father 's house in the distance .
Then they set off to run , and bounding into the room fell on their father 's neck .
The man had not passed a happy hour since he left them in the wood , but the woman had died .
Grettel shook out her apron so that the pearls and precious stones rolled about the room , and Hansel threw down one handful after the other out of his pocket .
Thus all their troubles were ended , and they lived happily ever afterward .
My story is done .
See !
there runs a little mouse ; anyone who catches it may make himself a large fur cap out of it .

SNOW-WHITE AND ROSE-RED A poor widow once lived in a little cottage with a garden in front of it , in which grew two rose trees , one bearing white roses and the other red .
She had two children , who were just like the two rose trees ; one was called Snow-white and the other Rose-red , and they were the sweetest and best children in the world , always diligent and always cheerful ; but Snow-white was quieter and more gentle than Rose-red .
Rose-red loved to run about the fields and meadows , and to pick flowers and catch butterflies ; but Snow-white sat at home with her mother and helped her in the household , or read aloud to her when there was no work to do .
The two children loved each other so dearly that they always walked about hand in hand whenever they went out together , and when Snow-white said , `` We will never desert each other , '' Rose-red answered : `` No , not as long as we live '' ; and the mother added : `` Whatever one gets she shall share with the other . ''
They often roamed about in the woods gathering berries and no beast offered to hurt them ; on the contrary , they came up to them in the most confiding manner ; the little hare would eat a cabbage leaf from their hands , the deer grazed beside them , the stag would bound past them merrily , and the birds remained on the branches and sang to them with all their might .
No evil ever befell them ; if they tarried late in the wood and night overtook them , they lay down together on the moss and slept till morning , and their mother knew they were quite safe , and never felt anxious about them .
Once , when they had slept all night in the wood and had been wakened by the morning sun , they perceived a beautiful child in a shining white robe sitting close to their resting-place .
The figure got up , looked at them kindly , but said nothing , and vanished into the wood .
And when they looked round about them they became aware that they had slept quite close to a precipice , over which they would certainly have fallen had they gone on a few steps further in the darkness .
And when they told their mother of their adventure , she said what they had seen must have been the angel that guards good children .
Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother 's cottage so beautifully clean and neat that it was a pleasure to go into it .
In summer Rose-red looked after the house , and every morning before her mother awoke she placed a bunch of flowers before the bed , from each tree a rose .
In winter Snow-white lit the fire and put on the kettle , which was made of brass , but so beautifully polished that it shone like gold .
In the evening when the snowflakes fell their mother said : `` Snow-white , go and close the shutters , '' and they drew round the fire , while the mother put on her spectacles and read aloud from a big book and the two girls listened and sat and span .
Beside them on the ground lay a little lamb , and behind them perched a little white dove with its head tucked under its wings .
One evening as they sat thus cosily together someone knocked at the door as though he desired admittance .
The mother said : `` Rose-red , open the door quickly ; it must be some traveler seeking shelter . ''
Rose-red hastened to unbar the door , and thought she saw a poor man standing in the darkness outside ; but it was no such thing , only a bear , who poked his thick black head through the door .
Rose-red screamed aloud and sprang back in terror , the lamb began to bleat , the dove flapped its wings , and Snow-white ran and hid behind her mother 's bed .
But the bear began to speak , and said : `` Do n't be afraid : I wo n't hurt you .
I am half frozen , and only wish to warm myself a little . ''
`` My poor bear , '' said the mother , `` lie down by the fire , only take care you do n't burn your fur . ''
Then she called out : `` Snow-white and Rose-red , come out ; the bear will do you no harm ; he is a good , honest creature . ''
So they both came out of their hiding-places , and gradually the lamb and dove drew near too , and they all forgot their fear .
The bear asked the children to beat the snow a little out of his fur , and they fetched a brush and scrubbed him till he was dry .
Then the beast stretched himself in front of the fire , and growled quite happily and comfortably .
The children soon grew quite at their ease with him , and led their helpless guest a fearful life .
They tugged his fur with their hands , put their small feet on his back , and rolled him about here and there , or took a hazel wand and beat him with it ; and if he growled they only laughed .
The bear submitted to everything with the best possible good-nature , only when they went too far he cried : `` Oh !
children , spare my life !
`` Snow-white and Rose-red , Do n't beat your lover dead . ''
When it was time to retire for the night , and the others went to bed , the mother said to the bear : `` You can lie there on the hearth , in heaven 's name ; it will be shelter for you from the cold and wet . ''
As soon as day dawned the children led him out , and he trotted over the snow into the wood .
From this time on the bear came every evening at the same hour , and lay down by the hearth and let the children play what pranks they liked with him ; and they got so accustomed to him that the door was never shut till their black friend had made his appearance .
When spring came , and all outside was green , the bear said one morning to Snow-white : `` Now I must go away , and not return again the whole summer . ''
`` Where are you going to , dear bear ? ''
asked Snow-white .
`` I must go to the wood and protect my treasure from the wicked dwarfs .
In winter , when the earth is frozen hard , they are obliged to remain underground , for they ca n't work their way through ; but now , when the sun has thawed and warmed the ground , they break through and come up above to spy the land and steal what they can ; what once falls into their hands and into their caves is not easily brought back to light . ''
Snow-white was quite sad over their friend 's departure , and when she unbarred the door for him , the bear , stepping out , caught a piece of his fur in the door-knocker , and Snow-white thought she caught sight of glittering gold beneath it , but she could n't be certain of it ; and the bear ran hastily away , and soon disappeared behind the trees .
A short time after this the mother sent the children into the wood to collect fagots .
They came in their wanderings upon a big tree which lay felled on the ground , and on the trunk among the long grass they noticed something jumping up and down , but what it was they could n't distinguish .
When they approached nearer they perceived a dwarf with a wizened face and a beard a yard long .
The end of the beard was jammed into a cleft of the tree , and the little man sprang about like a dog on a chain , and did n't seem to know what he was to do .
He glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes , and screamed out : `` What are you standing there for ?
Ca n't you come and help me ? ''
`` What were you doing , little man ? ''
asked Rose-red .
`` You stupid , inquisitive goose ! ''
replied the dwarf ; `` I wanted to split the tree , in order to get little chips of wood for our kitchen fire ; those thick logs that serve to make fires for coarse , greedy people like yourselves quite burn up all the little food we need .
I had successfully driven in the wedge , and all was going well , but the cursed wood was so slippery that it suddenly sprang out , and the tree closed up so rapidly that I had no time to take my beautiful white beard out , so here I am stuck fast , and I ca n't get away ; and you silly , smooth-faced , milk-and-water girls just stand and laugh !
Ugh !
what wretches you are ! ''
The children did all in their power , but they could n't get the beard out ; it was wedged in far too firmly .
`` I will run and fetch somebody , '' said Rose-red .
`` Crazy blockheads ! ''
snapped the dwarf ; `` what 's the good of calling anyone else ?
You 're already two too many for me .
Does nothing better occur to you than that ? ''
`` Do n't be so impatient , '' said Snow-white , `` I 'll see you get help , '' and taking her scissors out of her pocket she cut off the end of his beard .
As soon as the dwarf felt himself free he seized a bag full of gold which was hidden among the roots of the tree , lifted it up , and muttered aloud : `` Curse these rude wretches , cutting off a piece of my splendid beard ! ''
With these words he swung the bag over his back , and disappeared without as much as looking at the children again .
Shortly after this Snow-white and Rose-red went out to get a dish of fish .
As they approached the stream they saw something which looked like an enormous grasshopper springing toward the water as if it were going to jump in .
They ran forward and recognized their old friend the dwarf .
`` Where are you going to ? ''
asked Rose-red ; `` you 're surely not going to jump into the water ? ''
`` I 'm not such a fool , '' screamed the dwarf .
`` Do n't you see that cursed fish is trying to drag me in ? ''
The little man had been sitting on the bank fishing , when unfortunately the wind had entangled his beard in the line ; and when immediately afterward a big fish bit , the feeble little creature had no strength to pull it out ; the fish had the upper fin , and dragged the dwarf toward him .
He clung on with all his might to every rush and blade of grass , but it did n't help him much ; he had to follow every movement of the fish , and was in great danger of being drawn into the water .
The girls came up just at the right moment , held him firm , and did all they could to disentangle his beard from the line ; but in vain , beard and line were in a hopeless muddle .
Nothing remained but to produce the scissors and cut the beard , by which a small part of it was sacrificed .
When the dwarf perceived what they were about he yelled to them : `` Do you call that manners , you toad-stools !
to disfigure a fellow 's face ?
It was n't enough that you shortened my beard before , but you must now needs cut off the best bit of it .
I ca n't appear like this before my own people .
I wish you 'd been in Jericho first . ''
Then he fetched a sack of pearls that lay among the rushes , and without saying another word he dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone .
It happened that soon after this the mother sent the two girls to the town to buy needles , thread , laces , and ribbons .
Their road led over a heath where huge boulders of rock lay scattered here and there .
While trudging along they saw a big bird hovering in the air , circling slowly above them , but always descending lower , till at last it settled on a rock not far from them .
Immediately afterward they heard a sharp , piercing cry .
They ran forward , and saw with horror that the eagle had pounced on their old friend the dwarf , and was about to carry him off .
The tender-hearted children seized hold of the little man , and struggled so long with the bird that at last he let go his prey .
When the dwarf had recovered from the first shock he screamed in his screeching voice : `` Could n't you have treated me more carefully ?
You have torn my thin little coat all to shreds , useless , awkward hussies that you are ! ''
Then he took a bag of precious stones and vanished under the rocks into his cave .
The girls were accustomed to his ingratitude , and went on their way and did their business in town .
On their way home , as they were again passing the heath , they surprised the dwarf pouring out his precious stones on an open space , for he had thought no one would pass by at so late an hour .
The evening sun shone on the glittering stones , and they glanced and gleamed so beautifully that the children stood still and gazed on them .
`` What are you standing there gaping for ? ''
screamed the dwarf , and his ashen-gray face became scarlet with rage .
He was about to go off with these angry words when a sudden growl was heard , and a black bear trotted out of the wood .
The dwarf jumped up in great fright , but he had n't time to reach his place of retreat , for the bear was already close to him .
Then he cried in terror : `` Dear Mr. Bear , spare me !
I 'll give you all my treasure .
Look at those beautiful precious stones lying there .
Spare my life !
what pleasure would you get from a poor feeble little fellow like me ?
You wo n't feel me between your teeth .
There , lay hold of these two wicked girls , they will be a tender morsel for you , as fat as young quails ; eat them up , for heaven 's sake . ''
But the bear , paying no attention to his words , gave the evil little creature one blow with his paw , and he never moved again .
The girls had run away , but the bear called after them : `` Snow-white and Rose-red , do n't be afraid ; wait , and I 'll come with you . ''
Then they recognized his voice and stood still , and when the bear was quite close to them his skin suddenly fell off , and a beautiful man stood beside them , all dressed in gold .
`` I am a king 's son , '' he said , `` and have been doomed by that unholy little dwarf , who had stolen my treasure , to roam about the woods as a wild bear till his death should set me free .
Now he has got his well-merited punishment . ''
Snow-white married him , and Rose-red his brother , and they divided the great treasure the dwarf had collected in his cave between them .
The old mother lived for many years peacefully with her children ; and she carried the two rose trees with her , and they stood in front of her window , and every year they bore the finest red and white roses .

THE GOOSE-GIRL Once upon a time an old queen , whose husband had been dead for many years , had a beautiful daughter .
When she grew up she was betrothed to a prince who lived a great way off .
Now , when the time drew near for her to be married and to depart into a foreign kingdom , her old mother gave her much costly baggage , and many ornaments , gold and silver , trinkets and knicknacks , and , in fact , everything that belonged to a royal trousseau , for she loved her daughter very dearly .
She gave her a waiting-maid also , who was to ride with her and hand her over to the bridegroom , and she provided each of them with a horse for the journey .
Now the Princess 's horse was called Falada , and could speak .
When the hour for departure drew near the old mother went to her bedroom , and taking a small knife she cut her fingers till they bled ; then she held a white rag under them , and letting three drops of blood fall into it , she gave it to her daughter , and said : `` Dear child , take great care of this rag : it may be of use to you on the journey . ''
So they took a sad farewell of each other , and the Princess stuck the rag in front of her dress , mounted her horse , and set forth on the journey to her bridegroom 's kingdom .
After they had ridden for about an hour the Princess began to feel very thirsty , and said to her waiting-maid : `` Pray get down and fetch me some water in my golden cup out of yonder stream : I would like a drink . ''
`` If you 're thirsty , '' said the maid , `` dismount yourself , and lie down by the water and drink ; I do n't mean to be your servant any longer . ''
The Princess was so thirsty that she got down , bent over the stream , and drank , for she was n't allowed to drink out of the golden goblet .
As she drank she murmured : `` Oh !
heaven , what am I to do ? ''
and the three drops of blood replied : `` If your mother only knew , Her heart would surely break in two . ''
But the Princess was meek , and said nothing about her maid 's rude behavior , and quietly mounted her horse again .
They rode on their way for several miles , but the day was hot , and the sun 's rays smote fiercely on them , so that the Princess was soon overcome by thirst again .
And as they passed a brook she called once more to her waiting-maid : `` Pray get down and give me a drink from my golden cup , '' for she had long ago forgotten her maid 's rude words .
But the waiting-maid replied , more haughtily even than before : `` If you want a drink , you can dismount and get it ; I do n't mean to be your servant . ''
Then the Princess was compelled by her thirst to get down , and bending over the flowing water she cried and said : `` Oh !
heaven , what am I to do ? ''
and the three drops of blood replied : `` If your mother only knew , Her heart would surely break in two . ''
And as she drank thus , and leaned right over the water , the rag containing the three drops of blood fell from her bosom and floated down the stream , and she in her anxiety never even noticed her loss .
But the waiting-maid had observed it with delight , as she knew it gave her power over the bride , for in losing the drops of blood the Princess had become weak and powerless .
When she wished to get on her horse Falada again , the waiting-maid called out : `` I mean to ride Falada : you must mount my beast '' ; and this too she had to submit to .
Then the waiting-maid commanded her harshly to take off her royal robes , and to put on her common ones , and finally she made her swear by heaven not to say a word about the matter when they reached the palace ; and if she had n't taken this oath she would have been killed on the spot .
But Falada observed everything , and laid it all to heart .
The waiting-maid now mounted Falada , and the real bride the worse horse , and so they continued their journey till at length they arrived at the palace yard .
There was great rejoicing over the arrival , and the Prince sprang forward to meet them , and taking the waiting-maid for his bride , he lifted her down from her horse and led her upstairs to the royal chamber .
In the meantime the real Princess was left standing below in the courtyard .
The old King , who was looking out of his window , beheld her in this plight , and it struck him how sweet and gentle , even beautiful , she looked .
He went at once to the royal chamber , and asked the bride who it was she had brought with her and had left thus standing in the court below .
`` Oh ! ''
replied the bride , `` I brought her with me to keep me company on the journey ; give the girl something to do , that she may not be idle . ''
But the old King had no work for her , and could n't think of anything ; so he said , `` I 've a small boy who looks after the geese , she 'd better help him . ''
The youth 's name was Curdken , and the real bride was made to assist him in herding geese .
Soon after this the false bride said to the Prince : `` Dearest husband , I pray you grant me a favor . ''
He answered : `` That I will . ''
`` Then let the slaughterer cut off the head of the horse I rode here upon , because it behaved very badly on the journey . ''
But the truth was she was afraid lest the horse should speak and tell how she had treated the Princess .
She carried her point , and the faithful Falada was doomed to die .
When the news came to the ears of the real Princess she went to the slaughterer , and secretly promised him a piece of gold if he would do something for her .
There was in the town a large dark gate , through which she had to pass night and morning with the geese ; would he `` kindly hang up Falada 's head there , that she might see it once again ? ''
The slaughterer said he would do as she desired , chopped off the head , and nailed it firmly over the gateway .
Early next morning , as she and Curdken were driving their flock through the gate , she said as she passed under : `` Oh !
Falada , 't is you hang there '' ; and the head replied : '' 'T is you ; pass under , Princess fair : If your mother only knew , Her heart would surely break in two . ''
Then she left the tower and drove the geese into a field .
And when they had reached the common where the geese fed she sat down and unloosed her hair , which was of pure gold .
Curdken loved to see it glitter in the sun , and wanted much to pull some hair out .
Then she spoke : `` Wind , wind , gently sway , Blow Curdken 's hat away ; Let him chase o'er field and wold Till my locks of ruddy gold , Now astray and hanging down , Be combed and plaited in a crown . ''
Then a gust of wind blew Curdken 's hat away , and he had to chase it over hill and dale .
When he returned from the pursuit she had finished her combing and curling , and his chance of getting any hair was gone .
Curdken was very angry , and would n't speak to her .
So they herded the geese till evening and then went home .
The next morning , as they passed under the gate , the girl said : `` Oh !
Falada , 't is you hang there ; '' and the head replied : '' 'T is you ; pass under , Princess fair : If your mother only knew , Her heart would surely break in two . ''
Then she went on her way till she came to the common , where she sat down and began to comb out her hair ; then Curdken ran up to her and wanted to grasp some of the hair from her head , but she called out hastily : `` Wind , wind , gently sway , Blow Curdken 's hat away ; Let him chase o'er field and wold Till my locks of ruddy gold , Now astray and hanging down , Be combed and plaited in a crown . ''
Then a puff of wind came and blew Curdken 's hat far away , so that he had to run after it ; and when he returned she had long finished putting up her golden locks , and he could n't get any hair ; so they watched the geese till it was dark .
But that evening when they got home Curdken went to the old King , and said : `` I refuse to herd geese any longer with that girl . ''
`` For what reason ? ''
asked the old King .
`` Because she does nothing but annoy me all day long , '' replied Curdken ; and he proceeded to relate all her iniquities , and said : `` Every morning as we drive the flock through the dark gate she says to a horse 's head that hangs on the wall : '' ` Oh !
Falada , 't is you hang there ' ; and the head replies : '' '' Tis you ; pass under , Princess fair : If your mother only knew , Her heart would surely break in two . ' ''
And Curdken went on to tell what passed on the common where the geese fed , and how he had always to chase his hat .
The old King bade him go and drive forth his flock as usual next day ; and when morning came he himself took up his position behind the dark gate , and heard how the goose-girl greeted Falada .
Then he followed her through the field , and hid himself behind a bush on the common .
He soon saw with his own eyes how the goose-boy and the goose-girl looked after the geese , and how after a time the maiden sat down and loosed her hair , that glittered like gold , and repeated : `` Wind , wind , gently sway , Blow Curdken 's hat away ; Let him chase o'er field and wold Till my locks of ruddy gold Now astray and hanging down , Be combed and plaited in a crown . ''
Then a gust of wind came and blew Curdken 's hat away , so that he had to fly over hill and dale after it , and the girl in the meantime quietly combed and plaited her hair : all this the old King observed , and returned to the palace without anyone having noticed him .
In the evening when the goose-girl came home he called her aside , and asked her why she behaved as she did .
`` I may not tell you why ; how dare I confide my woes to anyone ?
for I swore not to by heaven , otherwise I should have lost my life . ''
The old King begged her to tell him all , and left her no peace , but he could get nothing out of her .
At last he said : `` Well , if you wo n't tell me , confide your trouble to the iron stove there , '' and he went away .
Then she crept to the stove , and began to sob and cry and to pour out her poor little heart , and said : `` Here I sit , deserted by all the world , I who am a king 's daughter , and a false waiting-maid has forced me to take off my own clothes , and has taken my place with my bridegroom , while I have to fulfill the lowly office of goose-girl .
`` If my mother only knew Her heart would surely break in two . ''
But the old King stood outside at the stove chimney , and listened to her words .
Then he entered the room again , and bidding her leave the stove , he ordered royal apparel to be put on her , in which she looked amazingly lovely .
Then he summoned his son , and revealed to him that he had got the false bride , who was nothing but a waiting-maid , while the real one , in the guise of the ex-goose-girl , was standing at his side .
The young King rejoiced from his heart when he saw her beauty and learned how good she was , and a great banquet was prepared , to which everyone was bidden .
The bridegroom sat at the head of the table , the Princess on one side of him and the waiting-maid on the other ; but she was so dazzled that she did not recognize the Princess in her glittering garments .
Now when they had eaten and drunk , and were merry , the old King asked the waiting-maid to solve a knotty point for him .
`` What , '' said he , `` should be done to a certain person who has deceived everyone ? ''
and he proceeded to relate the whole story , ending up with , `` Now what sentence should be passed ? ''
Then the false bride answered : `` She deserves to be put stark naked into a barrel lined with sharp nails , which should be dragged by two white horses up and down the street till she is dead . ''
`` You are the person , '' said the King , `` and you have passed sentence on yourself ; and even so it shall be done to you . ''
And when the sentence had been carried out the young King was married to his real bride , and both reigned over the kingdom in peace and happiness .

TOADS AND DIAMONDS THERE was once upon a time a widow who had two daughters .
The eldest was so much like her in the face and humor that whoever looked upon the daughter saw the mother .
They were both so disagreeable and so proud that there was no living with them .
The youngest , who was the very picture of her father for courtesy and sweetness of temper , was withal one of the most beautiful girls ever seen .
As people naturally love their own likeness , this mother even doted on her eldest daughter and at the same time had a horrible aversion for the youngest -- she made her eat in the kitchen and work continually .
Among other things , this poor child was forced twice a day to draw water above a mile and a-half off the house , and bring home a pitcher full of it .
One day , as she was at this fountain , there came to her a poor woman , who begged of her to let her drink .
`` Oh !
ay , with all my heart , Goody , '' said this pretty little girl ; and rinsing immediately the pitcher , she took up some water from the clearest place of the fountain , and gave it to her , holding up the pitcher all the while , that she might drink the easier .
The good woman , having drunk , said to her : `` You are so very pretty , my dear , so good and so mannerly , that I can not help giving you a gift . ''
For this was a fairy , who had taken the form of a poor country woman , to see how far the civility and good manners of this pretty girl would go .
`` I will give you for a gift , '' continued the Fairy , `` that , at every word you speak , there shall come out of your mouth either a flower or a jewel . ''
When this pretty girl came home her mother scolded her for staying so long at the fountain .
`` I beg your pardon , mamma , '' said the poor girl , `` for not making more haste . ''
And in speaking these words there came out of her mouth two roses , two pearls , and two diamonds .
`` What is it I see there ? ''
said the mother , quite astonished .
`` I think I see pearls and diamonds come out of the girl 's mouth !
How happens this , child ? ''
This was the first time she had ever called her child .
The poor creature told her frankly all the matter , not without dropping out infinite numbers of diamonds .
`` In good faith , '' cried the mother , `` I must send my child thither .
Come hither , Fanny ; look what comes out of thy sister 's mouth when she speaks .
Wouldst not thou be glad , my dear , to have the same gift given thee ?
Thou hast nothing else to do but go and draw water out of the fountain , and when a certain poor woman asks you to let her drink , to give it to her very civilly . ''
`` It would be a very fine sight indeed , '' said this ill-bred minx , `` to see me go draw water . ''
`` You shall go , hussy ! ''
said the mother ; `` and this minute . ''
So away she went , but grumbling all the way , taking with her the best silver tankard in the house .
She was no sooner at the fountain than she saw coming out of the wood a lady most gloriously dressed , who came up to her , and asked to drink .
This was , you must know , the very fairy who appeared to her sister , but now had taken the air and dress of a princess , to see how far this girl 's rudeness would go .
`` Am I come hither , '' said the proud , saucy one , `` to serve you with water , pray ?
I suppose the silver tankard was brought purely for your ladyship , was it ?
However , you may drink out of it , if you have a fancy . ''
`` You are not over and above mannerly , '' answered the Fairy , without putting herself in a passion .
`` Well , then , since you have so little breeding , and are so disobliging , I give you for a gift that at every word you speak there shall come out of your mouth a snake or a toad . ''
So soon as her mother saw her coming she cried out : `` Well , daughter ? ''
`` Well , mother ? ''
answered the pert hussy , throwing out of her mouth two vipers and two toads .
`` Oh !
mercy , '' cried the mother ; `` what is it I see ?
Oh !
it is that wretch her sister who has occasioned all this ; but she shall pay for it '' ; and immediately she ran to beat her .
The poor child fled away from her , and went to hide herself in the forest , not far from thence .
The King 's son , then on his return from hunting , met her , and seeing her so very pretty , asked her what she did there alone and why she cried .
`` Alas !
sir , my mamma has turned me out of doors . ''
The King 's son , who saw five or six pearls and as many diamonds come out of her mouth , desired her to tell him how that happened .
She thereupon told him the whole story ; and so the King 's son fell in love with her , and , considering himself that such a gift was worth more than any marriage portion , conducted her to the palace of the King his father , and there married her .
As for the sister , she made herself so much hated that her own mother turned her off ; and the miserable wretch , having wandered about a good while without finding anybody to take her in , went to a corner of the wood , and there died .

PRINCE DARLING ONCE upon a time there lived a king who was so just and kind that his subjects called him `` the Good King . ''
It happened one day , when he was out hunting , that a little white rabbit , which his dogs were chasing , sprang into his arms for shelter .
The King stroked it gently , and said to it : `` Well , bunny , as you have come to me for protection I will see that nobody hurts you . ''
And he took it home to his palace and had it put in a pretty little house , with all sorts of nice things to eat .
That night , when he was alone in his room , a beautiful lady suddenly appeared before him ; her long dress was as white as snow , and she had a crown of white roses upon her head .
The good King was very much surprised to see her , for he knew his door had been tightly shut , and he could not think how she had got in .
But she said to him : `` I am the Fairy Truth .
I was passing through the wood when you were out hunting , and I wished to find out if you were really good , as everybody said you were , so I took the shape of a little rabbit and came to your arms for shelter , for I know that those who are merciful to animals will be still kinder to their fellow-men .
If you had refused to help me I should have been certain that you were wicked .
I thank you for the kindness you have shown me , which has made me your friend for ever .
You have only to ask me for anything you want and I promise that I will give it to you . ''
`` Madam , '' said the good King , `` since you are a fairy you no doubt know all my wishes .
I have but one son whom I love very dearly , that is why he is called Prince Darling .
If you are really good enough to wish to do me a favor , I beg that you will become his friend . ''
`` With all my heart , '' answered the Fairy .
`` I can make your son the handsomest prince in the world , or the richest , or the most powerful ; choose whichever you like for him . ''
`` I do not ask either of these things for my son , '' replied the good King ; `` but if you will make him the best of princes , I shall indeed be grateful to you .
What good would it do him to be rich , or handsome , or to possess all the kingdoms of the world if he were wicked ?
You know well he would still be unhappy .
Only a good man can be really contented . ''
`` You are quite right , '' answered the Fairy ; `` but it is not in my power to make Prince Darling a good man unless he will help me ; he must himself try hard to become good , I can only promise to give him good advice , to scold him for his faults , and to punish him if he will not correct and punish himself . ''
The good King was quite satisfied with this promise ; and very soon afterward he died .
Prince Darling was very sorry , for he loved his father with all his heart , and he would willingly have given all his kingdoms and all his treasures of gold and silver if they could have kept the good King with him .
Two days afterward , when the Prince had gone to bed , the Fairy suddenly appeared to him and said : `` I promised your father that I would be your friend , and to keep my word I have come to bring you a present . ''
At the same time she put a little gold ring upon his finger .
`` Take great care of this ring , '' she said : `` it is more precious than diamonds ; every time you do a bad deed it will prick your finger , but if , in spite of its pricking , you go on in your own evil way , you will lose my friendship , and I shall become your enemy . ''
So saying , the Fairy disappeared , leaving Prince Darling very much astonished .
For some time he behaved so well that the ring never pricked him , and that made him so contented that his subjects called him Prince Darling the Happy .
One day , however , he went out hunting , but could get no sport , which put him in a very bad temper ; it seemed to him as he rode along that his ring was pressing into his finger , but as it did not prick him he did not heed it .
When he got home and went to his own room , his little dog Bibi ran to meet him , jumping round him with pleasure .
`` Get away ! ''
said the Prince , quite gruffly .
`` I do n't want you , you are in the way . ''
The poor little dog , who did n't understand this at all , pulled at his coat to make him at least look at her , and this made Prince Darling so cross that he gave her quite a hard kick .
Instantly his ring pricked him sharply , as if it had been a pin .
He was very much surprised , and sat down in a corner of his room feeling quite ashamed of himself .
`` I believe the Fairy is laughing at me , '' he thought .
`` Surely I can have done no great wrong in just kicking a tiresome animal !
What is the good of my being ruler of a great kingdom if I am not even allowed to beat my own dog ? ''
`` I am not making fun of you , '' said a voice , answering Prince Darling 's thoughts .
`` You have committed three faults .
First of all , you were out of temper because you could not have what you wanted , and you thought all men and animals were only made to do your pleasure ; then you were really angry , which is very naughty indeed ; and lastly , you were cruel to a poor little animal who did not in the least deserve to be ill-treated .
`` I know you are far above a little dog , but if it were right and allowable that great people should ill-treat all who are beneath them , I might at this moment beat you , or kill you , for a fairy is greater than a man .
The advantage of possessing a great empire is not to be able to do the evil that one desires , but to do all the good that one possibly can . ''
The Prince saw how naughty he had been , and promised to try and do better in future , but he did not keep his word .
The fact was he had been brought up by a foolish nurse , who had spoiled him when he was little .
If he wanted anything he only had to cry and fret and stamp his feet and she would give him whatever he asked for , which had made him self-willed ; also she had told him from morning to night that he would one day be a king , and that kings were very happy , because everyone was bound to obey and respect them , and no one could prevent them from doing just as they liked .
When the Prince grew old enough to understand , he soon learned that there could be nothing worse than to be proud , obstinate , and conceited , and he had really tried to cure himself of these defects , but by that time all his faults had become habits ; and a bad habit is very hard to get rid of .
Not that he was naturally of a bad disposition ; he was truly sorry when he had been naughty , and said : `` I am very unhappy to have to struggle against my anger and pride every day ; if I had been punished for them when I was little they would not be such a trouble to me now . ''
His ring pricked him very often , and sometimes he left off what he was doing at once ; but at other times he would not attend to it .
Strangely enough , it gave him only a slight prick for a trifling fault , but when he was really naughty it made his finger actually bleed .
At last he got tired of being constantly reminded , and wanted to be able to do as he liked , so he threw his ring aside , and thought himself the happiest of men to have got rid of its teasing pricks .
He gave himself up to doing every foolish thing that occurred to him , until he became quite wicked and nobody could like him any longer .
One day , when the Prince was walking about , he saw a young girl who was so very pretty that he made up his mind at once that he would marry her .
Her name was Celia , and she was as good as she was beautiful .
Prince Darling fancied that Celia would think herself only too happy if he offered to make her a great queen , but she said fearlessly : `` Sire , I am only a shepherdess , and a poor girl , but , nevertheless , I will not marry you . ''
`` Do you dislike me ? ''
asked the Prince , who was very much vexed at this answer .
`` No , my Prince , '' replied Celia ; `` I can not help thinking you very handsome ; but what good would riches be to me , and all the grand dresses and splendid carriages that you would give me , if the bad deeds which I should see you do every day made me hate and despise you ? ''
The Prince was very angry at this speech , and commanded his officers to make Celia a prisoner and carry her off to his palace .
All day long the remembrance of what she had said annoyed him , but as he loved her he could not make up his mind to have her punished .
One of the Prince 's favorite companions was his foster-brother , whom he trusted entirely ; but he was not at all a good man , and gave Prince Darling very bad advice , and encouraged him in all his evil ways .
When he saw the Prince so downcast he asked what was the matter , and when he explained that he could not bear Celia 's bad opinion of him , and was resolved to be a better man in order to please her , this evil adviser said to him : `` You are very kind to trouble yourself about this little girl ; if I were you I would soon make her obey me .
Remember that you are a king , and that it would be laughable to see you trying to please a shepherdess , who ought to be only too glad to be one of your slaves .
Keep her in prison , and feed her on bread and water for a little while , and then , if she still says she will not marry you , have her head cut off , to teach other people that you mean to be obeyed .
Why , if you can not make a girl like that do as you wish , your subjects will soon forget that they are only put into this world for our pleasure . ''
`` But , '' said Prince Darling , `` would it not be a shame if I had an innocent girl put to death ?
For Celia has done nothing to deserve punishment . ''
`` If people will not do as you tell them they ought to suffer for it , '' answered his foster-brother ; `` but even if it were unjust , you had better be accused of that by your subjects than that they should find out that they may insult and thwart you as often as they please . ''
In saying this he was touching a weak point in his brother 's character ; for the Prince 's fear of losing any of his power made him at once abandon his first idea of trying to be good , and resolve to try and frighten the shepherdess into consenting to marry him .
His foster-brother , who wanted him to keep this resolution , invited three young courtiers , as wicked as himself to sup with the Prince , and they persuaded him to drink a great deal of wine , and continued to excite his anger against Celia by telling him that she had laughed at his love for her ; until at last , in quite a furious rage , he rushed off to find her , declaring that if she still refused to marry him she should be sold as a slave the very next day .
But when he reached the room in which Celia had been locked up , he was greatly surprised to find that she was not in it , though he had the key in his own pocket all the time .
His anger was terrible , and he vowed vengeance against whoever had helped her to escape .
His bad friends , when they heard him , resolved to turn his wrath upon an old nobleman who had formerly been his tutor ; and who still dared sometimes to tell the Prince of his faults , for he loved him as if he had been his own son .
At first Prince Darling had thanked him , but after a time he grew impatient and thought it must be just mere love of fault-finding that made his old tutor blame him when everyone else was praising and flattering him .
So he ordered him to retire from his Court , though he still , from time to time , spoke of him as a worthy man whom he respected , even if he no longer loved him .
His unworthy friends feared that he might some day take it into his head to recall his old tutor , so they thought they now had a good opportunity of getting him banished for ever .
They reported to the Prince that Suliman , for that was the tutor 's name , had boasted of having helped Celia to escape , and they bribed three men to say that Suliman himself had told them about it .
The Prince , in great anger , sent his foster-brother with a number of soldiers to bring his tutor before him , in chains , like a criminal .
After giving this order he went to his own room , but he had scarcely got into it when there was a clap of thunder which made the ground shake , and the Fairy Truth appeared suddenly before him .
`` I promised your father , '' said she sternly , `` to give you good advice , and to punish you if you refused to follow it .
You have despised my counsel , and have gone your own evil way until you are only outwardly a man ; really you are a monster -- the horror of everyone who knows you .
It is time that I should fulfil my promise , and begin your punishment .
I condemn you to resemble the animals whose ways you have imitated .
You have made yourself like the lion by your anger , and like the wolf by your greediness .
Like a snake , you have ungratefully turned upon one who was a second father to you ; your churlishness has made you like a bull .
Therefore , in your new form , take the appearance of all these animals . ''
The Fairy had scarcely finished speaking when Prince Darling saw to his horror that her words were fulfilled .
He had a lion 's head , a bull 's horns , a wolf 's feet , and a snake 's body .
At the same instant he found himself in a great forest , beside a clear lake , in which he could see plainly the horrible creature he had become , and a voice said to him : `` Look carefully at the state to which your wickedness has brought you ; believe me , your soul is a thousand times more hideous than your body . ''
Prince Darling recognized the voice of the Fairy Truth and turned in a fury to catch her and eat her up if he possibly could ; but he saw no one , and the same voice went on : `` I laugh at your powerlessness and anger , and I intend to punish your pride by letting you fall into the hands of your own subjects . ''
The Prince began to think that the best thing he could do would be to get as far away from the lake as he could , then at least he would not be continually reminded of his terrible ugliness .
So he ran toward the wood , but before he had gone many yards he fell into a deep pit which had been made to trap bears , and the hunters , who were hiding in a tree , leaped down , and secured him with several chains , and led him into the chief city of his own kingdom .
On the way , instead of recognizing that his own faults had brought this punishment upon him , he accused the Fairy of being the cause of all his misfortunes , and bit and tore at his chains furiously .
As they approached the town he saw that some great rejoicing was being held , and when the hunters asked what had happened they were told that the Prince , whose only pleasure it was to torment his people , had been found in his room , killed by a thunder-bolt -LRB- for that was what was supposed to have become of him -RRB- .
Four of his courtiers , those who had encouraged him in his wicked doings , had tried to seize the kingdom and divide it between them , but the people , who knew it was their bad counsels which had so changed the Prince , had cut off their heads , and had offered the crown to Suliman , whom the Prince had left in prison .
This noble lord had just been crowned , and the deliverance of the kingdom was the cause of the rejoicing `` For , '' they said , `` he is a good and just man , and we shall once more enjoy peace and prosperity . ''
Prince Darling roared with anger when he heard this ; but it was still worse for him when he reached the great square before his own palace .
He saw Suliman seated upon a magnificent throne , and all the people crowded round , wishing him a long life that he might undo all the mischief done by his predecessor .
Presently Suliman made a sign with his hand that the people should be silent , and said : `` I have accepted the crown you have offered me , but only that I may keep it for Prince Darling , who is not dead as you suppose ; the Fairy has assured me that there is still hope that you may some day see him again , good and virtuous as he was when he first came to the throne .
Alas ! ''
he continued , `` he was led away by flatterers .
I knew his heart , and am certain that if it had not been for the bad influence of those who surrounded him he would have been a good king and a father to his people .
We may hate his faults , but let us pity him and hope for his restoration .
As for me , I would die gladly if that could bring back our Prince to reign justly and worthily once more . ''
These words went to Prince Darling 's heart ; he realized the true affection and faithfulness of his old tutor , and for the first time reproached himself for all his evil deeds ; at the same instant he felt all his anger melting away , and he began quickly to think over his past life , and to admit that his punishment was not more than he had deserved .
He left off tearing at the iron bars of the cage in which he was shut up , and became as gentle as a lamb .
The hunters who had caught him took him to a great menagerie , where he was chained up among all the other wild beasts , and he determined to show his sorrow for his past bad behavior by being gentle and obedient to the man who had to take care of him .
Unfortunately , this man was very rough and unkind , and though the poor monster was quite quiet , he often beat him without rhyme or reason when he happened to be in a bad temper .
One day when this keeper was asleep a tiger broke its chain , and flew at him to eat him up .
Prince Darling , who saw what was going on , at first felt quite pleased to think that he should be delivered from his persecutor , but soon thought better of it and wished that he were free .
`` I would return good for evil , '' he said to himself , `` and save the unhappy man 's life . ''
He had hardly wished this when his iron cage flew open , and he rushed to the side of the keeper , who was awake and was defending himself against the tiger .
When he saw the monster had got out he gave himself up for lost , but his fear was soon changed into joy , for the kind monster threw itself upon the tiger and very soon killed it , and then came and crouched at the feet of the man it had saved .
Overcome with gratitude , the keeper stooped to caress the strange creature which had done him such a great service ; but suddenly a voice said in his ear : `` A good action should never go unrewarded , '' and at the same instant the monster disappeared , and he saw at his feet only a pretty little dog !
Prince Darling , delighted by the change , frisked about the keeper , showing his joy in every way he could , and the man , taking him up in his arms , carried him to the King , to whom he told the whole story .
The Queen said she would like to have this wonderful little dog , and the Prince would have been very happy in his new home if he could have forgotten that he was a man and a king .
The Queen petted and took care of him , but she was so afraid that he would get too fat that she consulted the court physician , who said that he was to be fed only upon bread , and was not to have much even of that .
So poor Prince Darling was terribly hungry all day long , but he was very patient about it .
One day , when they gave him his little loaf for breakfast , he thought he would like to eat it out in the garden ; so he took it up in his mouth and trotted away toward a brook that he knew of a long way from the palace .
But he was surprised to find that the brook was gone , and where it had been stood a great house that seemed to be built of gold and precious stones .
Numbers of people splendidly dressed were going into it , and sounds of music and dancing and feasting could be heard from the windows .
But what seemed very strange was that those people who came out of the house were pale and thin , and their clothes were torn , and hanging in rags about them .
Some fell down dead as they came out before they had time to get away ; others crawled farther with great difficulty ; while others again lay on the ground , fainting with hunger , and begged a morsel of bread from those who were going into the house , but they would not so much as look at the poor creatures .
Prince Darling went up to a young girl who was trying to eat a few blades of grass , she was so hungry .
Touched with compassion , he said to himself : `` I am very hungry , but I shall not die of starvation before I get my dinner ; if I give my breakfast to this poor creature perhaps I may save her life . ''
So he laid his piece of bread in the girl 's hand , and saw her eat it up eagerly .
She soon seemed to be quite well again , and the Prince , delighted to have been able to help her , was thinking of going home to the palace , when he heard a great outcry , and , turning round , saw Celia , who was being carried against her will into the great house .
For the first time the Prince regretted that he was no longer the monster , then he would have been able to rescue Celia ; now he could only bark feebly at the people who were carrying her off , and try to follow them , but they chased and kicked him away .
He determined not to quit the place till he knew what had become of Celia , and blamed himself for what had befallen her .
`` Alas ! ''
he said to himself , `` I am furious with the people who are carrying Celia off , but is n't that exactly what I did myself , and if I had not been prevented did I not intend to be still more cruel to her ? ''
Here he was interrupted by a noise above his head -- someone was opening a window , and he saw with delight that it was Celia herself , who came forward and threw out a plate of most delicious-looking food , then the window was shut again , and Prince Darling , who had not had anything to eat all day , thought he might as well take the opportunity of getting something .
He ran forward to begin , but the young girl to whom he had given his bread gave a cry of terror and took him up in her arms , saying : `` Do n't touch it , my poor little dog -- that house is the palace of pleasure , and everything that comes out of it is poisoned ! ''
At the same moment a voice said : `` You see a good action always brings its reward , '' and the Prince found himself changed into a beautiful white dove .
He remembered that white was the favorite color of the Fairy Truth , and began to hope that he might at last win back her favor .
But just now his first care was for Celia , and rising into the air he flew round and round the house , until he saw an open window ; but he searched through every room in vain .
No trace of Celia was to be seen , and the Prince , in despair , determined to search through the world till he found her .
He flew on and on for several days , till he came to a great desert , where he saw a cavern , and , to his delight , there sat Celia , sharing the simple breakfast of an old hermit .
Overjoyed to have found her , Prince Darling perched upon her shoulder , trying to express by his caresses how glad he was to see her again , and Celia , surprised and delighted by the tameness of this pretty white dove , stroked it softly , and said , though she never thought of its understanding her : `` I accept the gift that you make me of yourself , and I will love you always . ''
`` Take care what you are saying , Celia , '' said the old hermit ; `` are you prepared to keep that promise ? ''
`` Indeed , I hope so , my sweet shepherdess , '' cried the Prince , who was at that moment restored to his natural shape .
`` You promised to love me always ; tell me that you really mean what you said , or I shall have to ask the Fairy to give me back the form of the dove which pleased you so much . ''
`` You need not be afraid that she will change her mind , '' said the Fairy , throwing off the hermit 's robe in which she had been disguised and appearing before them .
`` Celia has loved you ever since she first saw you , only she would not tell you while you were so obstinate and naughty .
Now you have repented and mean to be good you deserve to be happy , and so she may love you as much as she likes . ''
Celia and Prince Darling threw themselves at the Fairy 's feet , and the Prince was never tired of thanking her for her kindness .
Celia was delighted to hear how sorry he was for all his past follies and misdeeds , and promised to love him as long as she lived .
`` Rise , my children , '' said the Fairy , `` and I will transport you to the palace , and Prince Darling shall have back again the crown he forfeited by his bad behavior . ''
While she was speaking , they found themselves in Suliman 's hall , and his delight was great at seeing his dear master once more .
He gave up the throne joyfully to the Prince , and remained always the most faithful of his subjects .
Celia and Prince Darling reigned for many years , but he was so determined to govern worthily and to do his duty that his ring , which he took to wearing again , never once pricked him severely .
-LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- 1 -RRB- Cabinet des Fees .
BLUE BEARD There was a man who had fine houses , both in town and country , a deal of silver and gold plate , embroidered furniture , and coaches gilded all over with gold .
But this man was so unlucky as to have a blue beard , which made him so frightfully ugly that all the women and girls ran away from him .
One of his neighbors , a lady of quality , had two daughters who were perfect beauties .
He desired of her one of them in marriage , leaving to her choice which of the two she would bestow on him .
They would neither of them have him , and sent him backward and forward from one another , not being able to bear the thoughts of marrying a man who had a blue beard , and what besides gave them disgust and aversion was his having already been married to several wives , and nobody ever knew what became of them .
Blue Beard , to engage their affection , took them , with the lady their mother and three or four ladies of their acquaintance , with other young people of the neighborhood , to one of his country seats , where they stayed a whole week .
There was nothing then to be seen but parties of pleasure , hunting , fishing , dancing , mirth , and feasting .
Nobody went to bed , but all passed the night in rallying and joking with each other .
In short , everything succeeded so well that the youngest daughter began to think the master of the house not to have a beard so very blue , and that he was a mighty civil gentleman .
As soon as they returned home , the marriage was concluded .
About a month afterward , Blue Beard told his wife that he was obliged to take a country journey for six weeks at least , about affairs of very great consequence , desiring her to divert herself in his absence , to send for her friends and acquaintances , to carry them into the country , if she pleased , and to make good cheer wherever she was .
`` Here , '' said he , `` are the keys of the two great wardrobes , wherein I have my best furniture ; these are of my silver and gold plate , which is not every day in use ; these open my strong boxes , which hold my money , both gold and silver ; these my caskets of jewels ; and this is the master-key to all my apartments .
But for this little one here , it is the key of the closet at the end of the great gallery on the ground floor .
Open them all ; go into all and every one of them , except that little closet , which I forbid you , and forbid it in such a manner that , if you happen to open it , there 's nothing but what you may expect from my just anger and resentment . ''
She promised to observe , very exactly , whatever he had ordered ; when he , after having embraced her , got into his coach and proceeded on his journey .
Her neighbors and good friends did not stay to be sent for by the new married lady , so great was their impatience to see all the rich furniture of her house , not daring to come while her husband was there , because of his blue beard , which frightened them .
They ran through all the rooms , closets , and wardrobes , which were all so fine and rich that they seemed to surpass one another .
After that they went up into the two great rooms , where was the best and richest furniture ; they could not sufficiently admire the number and beauty of the tapestry , beds , couches , cabinets , stands , tables , and looking-glasses , in which you might see yourself from head to foot ; some of them were framed with glass , others with silver , plain and gilded , the finest and most magnificent ever were seen .
They ceased not to extol and envy the happiness of their friend , who in the meantime in no way diverted herself in looking upon all these rich things , because of the impatience she had to go and open the closet on the ground floor .
She was so much pressed by her curiosity that , without considering that it was very uncivil to leave her company , she went down a little back staircase , and with such excessive haste that she had twice or thrice like to have broken her neck .
Coming to the closet-door , she made a stop for some time , thinking upon her husband 's orders , and considering what unhappiness might attend her if she was disobedient ; but the temptation was so strong she could not overcome it .
She then took the little key , and opened it , trembling , but could not at first see anything plainly , because the windows were shut .
After some moments she began to perceive that the floor was all covered over with clotted blood , on which lay the bodies of several dead women , ranged against the walls .
-LRB- These were all the wives whom Blue Beard had married and murdered , one after another . -RRB-
She thought she should have died for fear , and the key , which she pulled out of the lock , fell out of her hand .
After having somewhat recovered her surprise , she took up the key , locked the door , and went upstairs into her chamber to recover herself ; but she could not , she was so much frightened .
Having observed that the key of the closet was stained with blood , she tried two or three times to wipe it off , but the blood would not come out ; in vain did she wash it , and even rub it with soap and sand ; the blood still remained , for the key was magical and she could never make it quite clean ; when the blood was gone off from one side , it came again on the other .
Blue Beard returned from his journey the same evening , and said he had received letters upon the road , informing him that the affair he went about was ended to his advantage .
His wife did all she could to convince him she was extremely glad of his speedy return .
Next morning he asked her for the keys , which she gave him , but with such a trembling hand that he easily guessed what had happened .
`` What ! ''
said he , `` is not the key of my closet among the rest ? ''
`` I must certainly have left it above upon the table , '' said she .
`` Fail not to bring it to me presently , '' said Blue Beard .
After several goings backward and forward she was forced to bring him the key .
Blue Beard , having very attentively considered it , said to his wife , `` How comes this blood upon the key ? ''
`` I do not know , '' cried the poor woman , paler than death .
`` You do not know ! ''
replied Blue Beard .
`` I very well know .
You were resolved to go into the closet , were you not ?
Mighty well , madam ; you shall go in , and take your place among the ladies you saw there . ''
Upon this she threw herself at her husband 's feet , and begged his pardon with all the signs of true repentance , vowing that she would never more be disobedient .
She would have melted a rock , so beautiful and sorrowful was she ; but Blue Beard had a heart harder than any rock !
`` You must die , madam , '' said he , `` and that presently . ''
`` Since I must die , '' answered she -LRB- looking upon him with her eyes all bathed in tears -RRB- , `` give me some little time to say my prayers . ''
`` I give you , '' replied Blue Beard , `` half a quarter of an hour , but not one moment more . ''
When she was alone she called out to her sister , and said to her : `` Sister Anne '' -LRB- for that was her name -RRB- , `` go up , I beg you , upon the top of the tower , and look if my brothers are not coming over ; they promised me that they would come to-day , and if you see them , give them a sign to make haste . ''
Her sister Anne went up upon the top of the tower , and the poor afflicted wife cried out from time to time : `` Anne , sister Anne , do you see anyone coming ? ''
And sister Anne said : `` I see nothing but the sun , which makes a dust , and the grass , which looks green . ''
In the meanwhile Blue Beard , holding a great sabre in his hand , cried out as loud as he could bawl to his wife : `` Come down instantly , or I shall come up to you . ''
`` One moment longer , if you please , '' said his wife , and then she cried out very softly , `` Anne , sister Anne , dost thou see anybody coming ? ''
And sister Anne answered : `` I see nothing but the sun , which makes a dust , and the grass , which is green . ''
`` Come down quickly , '' cried Blue Beard , `` or I will come up to you . ''
`` I am coming , '' answered his wife ; and then she cried , `` Anne , sister Anne , dost thou not see anyone coming ? ''
`` I see , '' replied sister Anne , `` a great dust , which comes on this side here . ''
`` Are they my brothers ? ''
`` Alas !
no , my dear sister , I see a flock of sheep . ''
`` Will you not come down ? ''
cried Blue Beard `` One moment longer , '' said his wife , and then she cried out : `` Anne , sister Anne , dost thou see nobody coming ? ''
`` I see , '' said she , `` two horsemen , but they are yet a great way off . ''
`` God be praised , '' replied the poor wife joyfully ; `` they are my brothers ; I will make them a sign , as well as I can , for them to make haste . ''
Then Blue Beard bawled out so loud that he made the whole house tremble .
The distressed wife came down , and threw herself at his feet , all in tears , with her hair about her shoulders .
`` This signifies nothing , '' says Blue Beard ; `` you must die '' ; then , taking hold of her hair with one hand , and lifting up the sword with the other , he was going to take off her head .
The poor lady , turning about to him , and looking at him with dying eyes , desired him to afford her one little moment to recollect herself .
`` No , no , '' said he , `` recommend thyself to God , '' and was just ready to strike ... At this very instant there was such a loud knocking at the gate that Blue Beard made a sudden stop .
The gate was opened , and presently entered two horsemen , who , drawing their swords , ran directly to Blue Beard .
He knew them to be his wife 's brothers , one a dragoon , the other a musketeer , so that he ran away immediately to save himself ; but the two brothers pursued so close that they overtook him before he could get to the steps of the porch , when they ran their swords through his body and left him dead .
The poor wife was almost as dead as her husband , and had not strength enough to rise and welcome her brothers .
Blue Beard had no heirs , and so his wife became mistress of all his estate .
She made use of one part of it to marry her sister Anne to a young gentleman who had loved her a long while ; another part to buy captains commissions for her brothers , and the rest to marry herself to a very worthy gentleman , who made her forget the ill time she had passed with Blue Beard .

TRUSTY JOHN Once upon a time there was an old king who was so ill that he thought to himself , `` I am most likely on my death-bed . ''
Then he said , `` Send Trusty John to me . ''
Now Trusty John was his favorite servant , and was so called because all his life he had served him so faithfully .
When he approached the bed the King spake to him : `` Most trusty John , I feel my end is drawing near , and I could face it without a care were it not for my son .
He is still too young to decide everything for himself , and unless you promise me to instruct him in all he should know , and to be to him as a father , I shall not close my eyes in peace . ''
Then Trusty John answered : `` I will never desert him , and will serve him faithfully , even though it should cost me my life . ''
Then the old King said : `` Now I die comforted and in peace '' ; and then he went on : `` After my death you must show him the whole castle , all the rooms and apartments and vaults , and all the treasures that lie in them ; but you must not show him the last room in the long passage , where the picture of the Princess of the Golden Roof is hidden .
When he beholds that picture he will fall violently in love with it and go off into a dead faint , and for her sake he will encounter many dangers ; you must guard him from this . ''
And when Trusty John had again given the King his hand upon it the old man became silent , laid his head on the pillow , and died .
When the old King had been carried to his grave Trusty John told the young King what he had promised his father on his death-bed , and added : `` And I shall assuredly keep my word , and shall be faithful to you as I have been to him , even though it should cost me my life . ''
Now when the time of mourning was over , Trusty John said to him : `` It is time you should see your inheritance .
I will show you your ancestral castle . ''
So he took him over everything , and let him see all the riches and splendid apartments , only the one room where the picture was he did not open .
But the picture was placed so that if the door opened you gazed straight upon it , and it was so beautifully painted that you imagined it lived and moved , and that it was the most lovable and beautiful thing in the whole world .
But the young King noticed that Trusty John always missed one door , and said : `` Why do you never open this one for me ? ''
`` There is something inside that would appall you , '' he answered .
But the King replied : `` I have seen the whole castle , and shall find out what is in there '' ; and with these words he approached the door and wanted to force it open .
But Trusty John held him back , and said : `` I promised your father before his death that you should n't see what that room contains .
It might bring both you and me to great grief . ''
`` Ah !
no , '' answered the young King ; `` if I do n't get in , it will be my certain destruction ; I should have no peace night or day till I had seen what was in the room with my own eyes .
Now I do n't budge from the spot till you have opened the door . ''
Then Trusty John saw there was no way out of it , so with a heavy heart and many sighs he took the key from the big bunch .
When he had opened the door he stepped in first , and thought to cover the likeness so that the King might not perceive it ; but it was hopeless : the King stood on tiptoe and looked over his shoulder .
And when he saw the picture of the maid , so beautiful and glittering with gold and precious stones , he fell swooning to the ground .
Trusty John lifted him up , carried him to bed , and thought sorrowfully : `` The curse has come upon us ; gracious heaven !
what will be the end of it all ? ''
Then he poured wine down his throat till he came to himself again .
The first words he spoke were : `` Oh !
who is the original of the beautiful picture ? ''
`` She is the Princess of the Golden Roof , '' answered Trusty John .
Then the King continued : `` My love for her is so great that if all the leaves on the trees had tongues they could not express it ; my very life depends on my winning her .
You are my most trusty John : you must stand by me . ''
The faithful servant pondered long how they were to set about the matter , for it was said to be difficult even to get into the presence of the Princess .
At length he hit upon a plan , and spoke to the King : `` All the things she has about her -- tables , chairs , dishes , goblets , bowls , and all her household furniture -- are made of gold .
You have in your treasure five tons of gold ; let the goldsmiths of your kingdom manufacture them into all manner of vases and vessels , into all sorts of birds and game and wonderful beasts ; that will please her .
We shall go to her with them and try our luck . ''
The King summoned all his goldsmiths , and they had to work hard day and night , till at length the most magnificent things were completed .
When a ship had been laden with them the faithful John disguised himself as a merchant , and the King had to do the same , so that they should be quite unrecognizable .
And so they crossed the seas and journeyed till they reached the town where the Princess of the Golden Roof dwelt .
Trusty John made the King remain behind on the ship and await his return .
`` Perhaps , '' he said , `` I may bring the Princess back with me , so see that everything is in order ; let the gold ornaments be arranged and the whole ship decorated . ''
Then he took a few of the gold things in his apron , went ashore , and proceeded straight to the palace .
When he came to the courtyard he found a beautiful maiden standing at the well , drawing water with two golden pails .
And as she was about to carry away the glittering water she turned round and saw the stranger , and asked him who he was .
Then he replied : `` I am a merchant , '' and opening his apron , he let her peep in .
`` Oh !
my , '' she cried ; `` what beautiful gold wares ! ''
she set down her pails , and examined one thing after the other .
Then she said : `` The Princess must see this , she has such a fancy for gold things that she will buy up all you have . ''
She took him by the hand and let him into the palace , for she was the lady 's maid .
When the Princess had seen the wares she was quite enchanted , and said : `` They are all so beautifully made that I shall buy everything you have . ''
But Trusty John said : `` I am only the servant of a rich merchant , what I have here is nothing compared to what my master has on his ship ; his merchandise is more artistic and costly than anything that has ever been made in gold before . ''
She desired to have everything brought up to her , but he said : `` There is such a quantity of things that it would take many days to bring them up , and they would take up so many rooms that you would have no space for them in your house . ''
Thus her desire and curiosity were excited to such an extent that at last she said : `` Take me to your ship ; I shall go there myself and view your master 's treasures . ''
Then Trusty John was quite delighted , and brought her to the ship ; and the King , when he beheld her , saw that she was even more beautiful than her picture , and thought every moment that his heart would burst .
She stepped on to the ship , and the King led her inside .
But Trusty John remained behind with the steersman , and ordered the ship to push off .
`` Spread all sail , that we may fly on the ocean like a bird in the air . ''
Meanwhile the King showed the Princess inside all his gold wares , every single bit of it -- dishes , goblets , bowls , the birds and game , and all the wonderful beasts .
Many hours passed thus , and she was so happy that she did not notice that the ship was sailing away .
After she had seen the last thing she thanked the merchant and prepared to go home ; but when she came to the ship 's side she saw that they were on the high seas , far from land , and that the ship was speeding on its way under full canvas .
`` Oh ! ''
she cried in terror , `` I am deceived , carried away and betrayed into the power of a merchant ; I would rather have died ! ''
But the King seized her hand and spake : `` I am no merchant , but a king of as high birth as yourself ; and it was my great love for you that made me carry you off by stratagem .
The first time I saw your likeness I fell to the ground in a swoon . ''
When the Princess of the Golden Roof heard this she was comforted , and her heart went out to him , so that she willingly consented to become his wife .
Now it happened one day , while they were sailing on the high seas , that Trusty John , sitting on the forepart of the ship , fiddling away to himself , observed three ravens in the air flying toward him .
He ceased playing , and listened to what they were saying , for he understood their language .
The one croaked : `` Ah , ha !
so he 's bringing the Princess of the Golden Roof home . ''
`` Yes , '' answered the second , `` but he 's not got her yet . ''
`` Yes , he has , '' spake the third , `` for she 's sitting beside him on the ship . ''
Then number one began again and cried : `` That 'll not help him !
When they reach the land a chestnut horse will dash forward to greet them : the King will wish to mount it , and if he does it will gallop away with him , and disappear into the air , and he will never see his bride again . ''
`` Is there no escape for him ? ''
asked number two .
`` Oh !
yes , if someone else mounts quickly and shoots the horse dead with the pistol that is sticking in the holster , then the young King is saved .
But who 's to do that ?
And anyone who knows it and tells him will be turned into stone from his feet to his knees . ''
Then spake number two : `` I know more than that : even if the horse is slain , the young King will still not keep his bride : when they enter the palace together they will find a ready-made wedding shirt in a cupboard , which looks as though it were woven of gold and silver , but is really made of nothing but sulphur and tar : when the King puts it on it will burn him to his marrow and bones . ''
Number three asked : `` Is there no way of escape , then ? ''
`` Oh !
yes , '' answered number two : `` If someone seizes the shirt with gloved hands and throws it into the fire , and lets it burn , then the young King is saved .
But what 's the good ?
Anyone knowing this and telling it will have half his body turned into stone , from his knees to his heart . ''
Then number three spake : `` I know yet more : though the bridal shirt too be burnt , the King has n't even then secured his bride : when the dance is held after the wedding , and the young Queen is dancing , she will suddenly grow deadly white , and drop down like one dead , and unless some one lifts her up and draws three drops of blood from her right side , and spits them out again , she will die .
But if anyone who knows this betrays it , he will be turned into stone from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet . ''
When the ravens had thus conversed they fled onward , but Trusty John had taken it all in , and was sad and depressed from that time forward ; for if he were silent to his master concerning what he had heard , he would involve him in misfortune ; but if he took him into his confidence , then he himself would forfeit his life .
At last he said : `` I will stand by my master , though it should be my ruin . ''
Now when they drew near the land it came to pass just as the ravens had predicted , and a splendid chestnut horse bounded forward .
`` Capital ! ''
said the King ; `` this animal shall carry me to my palace , '' and was about to mount , but Trusty John was too sharp for him , and , springing up quickly , seized the pistol out of the holster and shot the horse dead .
Then the other servants of the King , who at no time looked favorably on Trusty John , cried out : `` What a sin to kill the beautiful beast that was to bear the King to his palace ! ''
But the King spake : `` Silence !
let him alone ; he is ever my most trusty John .
Who knows for what good end he may have done this thing ? ''
So they went on their way and entered the palace , and there in the hall stood a cupboard in which lay the ready-made bridal shirt , looking for all the world as though it were made of gold and silver .
The young King went toward it and was about to take hold of it , but Trusty John , pushing him aside , seized it with his gloved hands , threw it hastily into the fire , and let it burn The other servants commenced grumbling again , and said : `` See , he 's actually burning the King 's bridal shirt . ''
But the young King spoke : `` Who knows for what good purpose he does it ?
Let him alone , he is my most trusty John . ''
Then the wedding was celebrated , the dance began , and the bride joined in , but Trusty John watched her countenance carefully .
Of a sudden she grew deadly white , and fell to the ground as if she were dead .
He at once sprang hastily toward her , lifted her up , and bore her to a room , where he laid her down , and kneeling beside her he drew three drops of blood from her right side , and spat them out .
She soon breathed again and came to herself ; but the young King had watched the proceeding , and not knowing why Trusty John had acted as he did , he flew into a passion , and cried : `` Throw him into prison . ''
On the following morning sentence was passed on Trusty John , and he was condemned to be hanged .
As he stood on the gallows he said : `` Every one doomed to death has the right to speak once before he dies ; and I too have that privilege ? ''
`` Yes , '' said the King , `` it shall be granted to you . ''
So Trusty John spoke : `` I am unjustly condemned , for I have always been faithful to you '' ; and he proceeded to relate how he had heard the ravens ' conversation on the sea , and how he had to do all he did in order to save his master .
Then the King cried : `` Oh !
my most trusty John , pardon !
pardon !
Take him down . ''
But as he uttered the last word Trusty John had fallen lifeless to the ground , and was a stone .
The King and Queen were in despair , and the King spake : `` Ah !
how ill have I rewarded such great fidelity ! ''
and made them lift up the stone image and place it in his bedroom near his bed .
As often as he looked at it he wept and said : `` Oh !
if I could only restore you to life , my most trusty John ! ''
After a time the Queen gave birth to twins , two small sons , who throve and grew , and were a constant joy to her .
One day when the Queen was at church , and the two children sat and played with their father , he gazed again full of grief on the stone statue , and sighing , wailed : `` Oh , if I could only restore you to life , my most trusty John ! ''
Suddenly the stone began to speak , and said : `` Yes , you can restore me to life again if you are prepared to sacrifice what you hold most dear . ''
And the King cried out : `` All I have in the world will I give up for your sake . ''
The stone continued : `` If you cut off with your own hand the heads of your two children , and smear me with their blood , I shall come back to life . ''
The King was aghast when he heard that he had himself to put his children to death ; but when he thought of Trusty John 's fidelity , and how he had even died for him , he drew his sword , and with his own hand cut the heads off his children .
And when he had smeared the stone with their blood , life came back , and Trusty John stood once more safe and sound before him .
He spake to the King : `` Your loyalty shall be rewarded , '' and taking up the heads of the children , he placed them on their bodies , smeared the wounds with their blood , and in a minute they were all right again and jumping about as if nothing had happened .
Then the King was full of joy , and when he saw the Queen coming , he hid Trusty John and the two children in a big cupboard .
As she entered he said to her : `` Did you pray in church ? ''
`` Yes , '' she answered , `` but my thoughts dwelt constantly on Trusty John , and of what he has suffered for us . ''
Then he spake : `` Dear wife , we can restore him to life , but the price asked is our two little sons ; we must sacrifice them . ''
The Queen grew white and her heart sank , but she replied : `` We owe it to him on account of his great fidelity . ''
Then he rejoiced that she was of the same mind as he had been , and going forward he opened the cupboard , and fetched the two children and Trusty John out , saying : `` God be praised !
Trusty John is free once more , and we have our two small sons again . ''
Then he related to her all that had passed , and they lived together happily ever afterward .

THE BRAVE LITTLE TAILOR One summer 's day a little tailor sat on his table by the window in the best of spirits , and sewed for dear life .
As he was sitting thus a peasant woman came down the street , calling out : `` Good jam to sell , good jam to sell . ''
This sounded sweetly in the tailor 's ears ; he put his frail little head out of the window , and shouted : `` up here , my good woman , and you 'll find a willing customer . ''
The woman climbed up the three flights of stairs with her heavy basket to the tailor 's room , and he made her spread out all the pots in a row before him .
He examined them all , lifted them up and smelled them , and said at last : `` This jam seems good , weigh me four ounces of it , my good woman ; and even if it 's a quarter of a pound I wo n't stick at it . ''
The woman , who had hoped to find a good market , gave him what he wanted , but went away grumbling wrathfully .
`` Now heaven shall bless this jam for my use , '' cried the little tailor , `` and it shall sustain and strengthen me . ''
He fetched some bread out of a cupboard , cut a round off the loaf , and spread the jam on it .
`` That wo n't taste amiss , '' he said ; `` but I 'll finish that waistcoat first before I take a bite . ''
He placed the bread beside him , went on sewing , and out of the lightness of his heart kept on making his stitches bigger and bigger .
In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam rose to the ceiling , where heaps of flies were sitting , and attracted them to such an extent that they swarmed on to it in masses .
`` Ha !
who invited you ? ''
said the tailor , and chased the unwelcome guests away .
But the flies , who did n't understand English , refused to let themselves be warned off , and returned again in even greater numbers .
At last the little tailor , losing all patience , reached out of his chimney corner for a duster , and exclaiming : `` Wait , and I 'll give it to you , '' he beat them mercilessly with it .
When he left off he counted the slain , and no fewer than seven lay dead before him with outstretched legs .
`` What a desperate fellow I am ! ''
said he , and was filled with admiration at his own courage .
`` The whole town must know about this '' ; and in great haste the little tailor cut out a girdle , hemmed it , and embroidered on it in big letters , `` Seven at a blow . ''
`` What did I say , the town ?
no , the whole world shall hear of it , '' he said ; and his heart beat for joy as a lamb wags his tail .
The tailor strapped the girdle round his waist and set out into the wide world , for he considered his workroom too small a field for his prowess .
Before he set forth he looked round about him , to see if there was anything in the house he could take with him on his journey ; but he found nothing except an old cheese , which he took possession of .
In front of the house he observed a bird that had been caught in some bushes , and this he put into his wallet beside the cheese .
Then he went on his way merrily , and being light and agile he never felt tired .
His way led up a hill , on the top of which sat a powerful giant , who was calmly surveying the landscape .
The little tailor went up to him , and greeting him cheerfully said : `` Good-day , friend ; there you sit at your ease viewing the whole wide world .
I 'm just on my way there .
What do you say to accompanying me ? ''
The giant looked contemptuously at the tailor , and said : `` What a poor wretched little creature you are ! ''
`` That 's a good joke , '' answered the little tailor , and unbuttoning his coat he showed the giant the girdle .
`` There now , you can read what sort of a fellow I am . ''
The giant read : `` Seven at a blow '' ; and thinking they were human beings the tailor had slain , he conceived a certain respect for the little man .
But first he thought he 'd test him , so taking up a stone in his hand , he squeezed it till some drops of water ran out .
`` Now you do the same , '' said the giant , `` if you really wish to be thought strong . ''
`` Is that all ? ''
said the little tailor ; `` that 's child 's play to me , '' so he dived into his wallet , brought out the cheese , and pressed it till the whey ran out .
`` My squeeze was in sooth better than yours , '' said he .
The giant did n't know what to say , for he could n't have believed it of the little fellow .
To prove him again , the giant lifted a stone and threw it so high that the eye could hardly follow it .
`` Now , my little pigmy , let me see you do that . ''
`` Well thrown , '' said the tailor ; `` but , after all , your stone fell to the ground ; I 'll throw one that wo n't come down at all . ''
He dived into his wallet again , and grasping the bird in his hand , he threw it up into the air .
The bird , enchanted to be free , soared up into the sky , and flew away never to return .
`` Well , what do you think of that little piece of business , friend ? ''
asked the tailor .
`` You can certainly throw , '' said the giant ; `` but now let 's see if you can carry a proper weight . ''
With these words he led the tailor to a huge oak tree which had been felled to the ground , and said : `` If you are strong enough , help me to carry the tree out of the wood . ''
`` Most certainly , '' said the little tailor : `` just you take the trunk on your shoulder ; I 'll bear the top and branches , which is certainly the heaviest part . ''
The giant laid the trunk on his shoulder , but the tailor sat at his ease among the branches ; and the giant , who could n't see what was going on behind him , had to carry the whole tree , and the little tailor into the bargain .
There he sat behind in the best of spirits , lustily whistling a tune , as if carrying the tree were mere sport .
The giant , after dragging the heavy weight for some time , could get on no further , and shouted out : `` Hi !
I must let the tree fall . ''
The tailor sprang nimbly down , seized the tree with both hands as if he had carried it the whole way and said to the giant : `` Fancy a big lout like you not being able to carry a tree ! ''
They continued to go on their way together , and as they passed by a cherry tree the giant grasped the top of it , where the ripest fruit hung , gave the branches into the tailor 's hand , and bade him eat .
But the little tailor was far too weak to hold the tree down , and when the giant let go the tree swung back into the air , bearing the little tailor with it .
When he had fallen to the ground again without hurting himself , the giant said : `` What !
do you mean to tell me you have n't the strength to hold down a feeble twig ? ''
`` It was n't strength that was wanting , '' replied the tailor ; `` do you think that would have been anything for a man who has killed seven at a blow ?
I jumped over the tree because the huntsmen are shooting among the branches near us .
Do you do the like if you dare . ''
The giant made an attempt , but could n't get over the tree , and stuck fast in the branches , so that here too the little tailor had the better of him .
`` Well , you 're a fine fellow , after all , '' said the giant ; `` come and spend the night with us in our cave . ''
The little tailor willingly consented to do this , and following his friend they went on till they reached a cave where several other giants were sitting round a fire , each holding a roast sheep in his hand , of which he was eating .
The little tailor looked about him , and thought : `` Yes , there 's certainly more room to turn round in here than in my workshop . ''
The giant showed him a bed and bade him lie down and have a good sleep .
But the bed was too big for the little tailor , so he did n't get into it , but crept away into the corner .
At midnight , when the giant thought the little tailor was fast asleep , he rose up , and taking his big iron walking-stick , he broke the bed in two with a blow , and thought he had made an end of the little grasshopper .
At early dawn the giants went off to the wood , and quite forgot about the little tailor , till all of a sudden they met him trudging along in the most cheerful manner .
The giants were terrified at the apparition , and , fearful lest he should slay them , they all took to their heels as fast as they could .
The little tailor continued to follow his nose , and after he had wandered about for a long time he came to the courtyard of a royal palace , and feeling tired he lay down on the grass and fell asleep .
While he lay there the people came , and looking him all over read on his girdle : `` Seven at a blow . ''
`` Oh ! ''
they said , `` what can this great hero of a hundred fights want in our peaceful land ?
He must indeed be a mighty man of valor . ''
They went and told the King about him , and said what a weighty and useful man he 'd be in time of war , and that it would be well to secure him at any price .
This counsel pleased the King , and he sent one of his courtiers down to the little tailor , to offer him , when he awoke , a commission in their army .
The messenger remained standing by the sleeper , and waited till he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes , when he tendered his proposal .
`` That 's the very thing I came here for , '' he answered ; `` I am quite ready to enter the King 's service . ''
So he was received with all honor , and given a special house of his own to live in .
But the other officers resented the success of the little tailor , and wished him a thousand miles away .
`` What 's to come of it all ? ''
they asked each other ; `` if we quarrel with him , he 'll let out at us , and at every blow seven will fall .
There 'll soon be an end of us . ''
So they resolved to go in a body to the King , and all to send in their papers .
`` We are not made , '' they said , `` to hold out against a man who kills seven at a blow . ''
The King was grieved at the thought of losing all his faithful servants for the sake of one man , and he wished heartily that he had never set eyes on him , or that he could get rid of him .
But he did n't dare to send him away , for he feared he might kill him along with his people , and place himself on the throne .
He pondered long and deeply over the matter , and finally came to a conclusion .
He sent to the tailor and told him that , seeing what a great and warlike hero he was , he was about to make him an offer .
In a certain wood of his kingdom there dwelled two giants who did much harm ; by the way they robbed , murdered , burned , and plundered everything about them ; `` no one could approach them without endangering his life .
But if he could overcome and kill these two giants he should have his only daughter for a wife , and half his kingdom into the bargain ; he might have a hundred horsemen , too , to back him up . ''
`` That 's the very thing for a man like me , '' thought the little tailor ; `` one does n't get the offer of a beautiful princess and half a kingdom every day . ''
`` Done with you , '' he answered ; `` I 'll soon put an end to the giants .
But I have n't the smallest need of your hundred horsemen ; a fellow who can slay seven men at a blow need not be afraid of two . ''
The little tailor set out , and the hundred horsemen followed him .
When he came to the outskirts of the wood he said to his followers : `` You wait here , I 'll manage the giants by myself '' ; and he went on into the wood , casting his sharp little eyes right and left about him .
After a while he spied the two giants lying asleep under a tree , and snoring till the very boughs bent with the breeze .
The little tailor lost no time in filling his wallet with stones , and then climbed up the tree under which they lay .
When he got to about the middle of it he slipped along a branch till he sat just above the sleepers , when he threw down one stone after the other on the nearest giant .
The giant felt nothing for a long time , but at last he woke up , and pinching his companion said : `` What did you strike me for ? ''
`` I did n't strike you , '' said the other , `` you must be dreaming . ''
They both lay down to sleep again , and the tailor threw down a stone on the second giant , who sprang up and cried : `` What 's that for ?
Why did you throw something at me ? ''
`` I did n't throw anything , '' growled the first one .
They wrangled on for a time , till , as both were tired , they made up the matter and fell asleep again .
The little tailor began his game once more , and flung the largest stone he could find in his wallet with all his force , and hit the first giant on the chest .
`` This is too much of a good thing ! ''
he yelled , and springing up like a madman , he knocked his companion against the tree till he trembled .
He gave , however , as good as he got , and they became so enraged that they tore up trees and beat each other with them , till they both fell dead at once on the ground .
Then the little tailor jumped down .
`` It 's a mercy , '' he said , `` that they did n't root up the tree on which I was perched , or I should have had to jump like a squirrel on to another , which , nimble though I am , would have been no easy job . ''
He drew his sword and gave each of the giants a very fine thrust or two on the breast , and then went to the horsemen and said : `` The deed is done , I 've put an end to the two of them ; but I assure you it has been no easy matter , for they even tore up trees in their struggle to defend themselves ; but all that 's of no use against one who slays seven men at a blow . ''
`` Were n't you wounded ? ''
asked the horsemen .
`` No fear , '' answered the tailor ; `` they have n't touched a hair of my head . ''
But the horsemen would n't believe him till they rode into the wood and found the giants weltering in their blood , and the trees lying around , torn up by the roots .
The little tailor now demanded the promised reward from the King , but he repented his promise , and pondered once more how he could rid himself of the hero .
`` Before you obtain the hand of my daughter and half my kingdom , '' he said to him , `` you must do another deed of valor .
A unicorn is running about loose in the wood , and doing much mischief ; you must first catch it . ''
`` I 'm even less afraid of one unicorn than of two giants ; seven at a blow , that 's my motto . ''
He took a piece of cord and an axe with him , went out to the wood , and again told the men who had been sent with him to remain outside .
He had n't to search long , for the unicorn soon passed by , and , on perceiving the tailor , dashed straight at him as though it were going to spike him on the spot .
`` Gently , gently , '' said he , `` not so fast , my friend '' ; and standing still he waited till the beast was quite near , when he sprang lightly behind a tree ; the unicorn ran with all its force against the tree , and rammed its horn so firmly into the trunk that it had no strength left to pull it out again , and was thus successfully captured .
`` Now I 've caught my bird , '' said the tailor , and he came out from behind the tree , placed the cord round its neck first , then struck the horn out of the tree with his axe , and when everything was in order led the beast before the King .
Still the King did n't want to give him the promised reward and made a third demand .
The tailor was to catch a wild boar for him that did a great deal of harm in the wood ; and he might have the huntsmen to help him .
`` Willingly , '' said the tailor ; `` that 's mere child 's play . ''
But he did n't take the huntsmen into the wood with him , and they were well enough pleased to remain behind , for the wild boar had often received them in a manner which did not make them desire its further acquaintance .
As soon as the boar perceived the tailor it ran at him with foaming mouth and gleaming teeth , and tried to knock him down ; but our alert little friend ran into a chapel that stood near , and got out of the window again with a jump .
The boar pursued him into the church , but the tailor skipped round to the door , and closed it securely .
So the raging beast was caught , for it was far too heavy and unwieldy to spring out of the window .
The little tailor summoned the huntsmen together , that they might see the prisoner with their own eyes .
Then the hero betook himself to the King , who was obliged now , whether he liked it or not , to keep his promise , and hand him over his daughter and half his kingdom .
Had he known that no hero-warrior , but only a little tailor stood before him , it would have gone even more to his heart .
So the wedding was celebrated with much splendor and little joy , and the tailor became a king .
After a time the Queen heard her husband saying one night in his sleep : `` My lad , make that waistcoat and patch these trousers , or I 'll box your ears . ''
Thus she learned in what rank the young gentleman had been born , and next day she poured forth her woes to her father , and begged him to help her to get rid of a husband who was nothing more nor less than a tailor .
The King comforted her , and said : `` Leave your bedroom door open to-night , my servants shall stand outside , and when your husband is fast asleep they shall enter , bind him fast , and carry him on to a ship , which shall sail away out into the wide ocean . ''
The Queen was well satisfied with the idea , but the armor-bearer , who had overheard everything , being much attached to his young master , went straight to him and revealed the whole plot .
`` I 'll soon put a stop to the business , '' said the tailor .
That night he and his wife went to bed at the usual time ; and when she thought he had fallen asleep she got up , opened the door , and then lay down again .
The little tailor , who had only pretended to be asleep , began to call out in a clear voice : `` My lad , make that waistcoat and patch those trousers , or I 'll box your ears .
I have killed seven at a blow , slain two giants , led a unicorn captive , and caught a wild boar , then why should I be afraid of those men standing outside my door ? ''
The men , when they heard the tailor saying these words , were so terrified that they fled as if pursued by a wild army , and did n't dare go near him again .
So the little tailor was and remained a king all the days of his life .
A VOYAGE TO LILLIPUT CHAPTER I My father had a small estate in Nottinghamshire , and I was the third of four sons .
He sent me to Cambridge at fourteen years old , and after studying there three years I was bound apprentice to Mr. Bates , a famous surgeon in London .
There , as my father now and then sent me small sums of money , I spent them in learning navigation , and other arts useful to those who travel , as I always believed it would be some time or other my fortune to do .
Three years after my leaving him my good master , Mr. Bates , recommended me as ship 's surgeon to the `` Swallow , '' on which I voyaged three years .
When I came back I settled in London , and , having taken part of a small house , I married Miss Mary Burton , daughter of Mr. Edmund Burton , hosier .
But my good master Bates died two years after ; and as I had few friends my business began to fail , and I determined to go again to sea .
After several voyages , I accepted an offer from Captain W. Pritchard , master of the `` Antelope , '' who was making a voyage to the South Sea .
We set sail from Bristol , May 4 , 1699 ; and our voyage at first was very prosperous .
But in our passage to the East Indies we were driven by a violent storm to the north-west of Van Diemen 's Land .
Twelve of our crew died from hard labor and bad food , and the rest were in a very weak condition .
On the 5th of November , the weather being very hazy , the seamen spied a rock within 120 yards of the ship ; but the wind was so strong that we were driven straight upon it , and immediately split .
Six of the crew , of whom I was one , letting down the boat , got clear of the ship , and we rowed about three leagues , till we could work no longer .
We therefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves ; and in about half an hour the boat was upset by a sudden squall .
What became of my companions in the boat , or those who escaped on the rock or were left in the vessel , I can not tell ; but I conclude they were all lost .
For my part , I swam as fortune directed me , and was pushed forward by wind and tide ; but when I was able to struggle no longer I found myself within my depth .
By this time the storm was much abated .
I reached the shore at last , about eight o'clock in the evening , and advanced nearly half a mile inland , but could not discover any sign of inhabitants .
I was extremely tired , and with the heat of the weather I found myself much inclined to sleep .
I lay down on the grass , which was very short and soft , and slept sounder than ever I did in my life for about nine hours .
When I woke , it was just daylight .
I attempted to rise , but could not ; for as I happened to be lying on my back , I found my arms and legs were fastened on each side to the ground ; and my hair , which was long and thick , tied down in the same manner .
I could only look upward .
The sun began to grow hot , and the light hurt my eyes .
I heard a confused noise about me , but could see nothing except the sky .
In a little time I felt something alive and moving on my left leg , which , advancing gently over my breast , came almost up to my chin , when , bending my eyes downward , I perceived it to be a human creature , not six inches high , with a bow and arrow in his hands , and a quiver at his back .
In the meantime I felt at least forty more following the first .
I was in the utmost astonishment , and roared so loud that they all ran back in a fright ; and some of them were hurt with the falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground .
However , they soon returned , and one of them , who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face , lifted up his hands in admiration .
I lay all this while in great uneasiness ; but at length , struggling to get loose , I succeeded in breaking the strings that fastened my left arm to the ground ; and at the same time , with a violent pull that gave me extreme pain , I a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair , so that I was just able to turn my head about two inches .
But the creatures ran off a second time before I could seize them , whereupon there was a great shout , and in an instant I felt above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand , which pricked me like so many needles .
Moreover , they shot another flight into the air , of which some fell on my face , which I immediately covered with my left hand .
When this shower of arrows was over I groaned with grief and pain , and then , striving again to get loose , they discharged another flight of arrows larger than the first , and some of them tried to stab me with their spears ; but by good luck I had on a leather jacket , which they could not pierce .
By this time I thought it most prudent to lie still till night , when , my left hand being already loose , I could easily free myself ; and as for the inhabitants , I thought I might be a match for the greatest army they could bring against me if they were all of the same size as him I saw .
When the people observed that I was quiet they discharged no more arrows , but by the noise I heard I knew that their number was increased ; and about four yards from me , for more than an hour , there was a knocking , like people at work .
Then , turning my head that way as well as the pegs and strings would let me , I saw a stage set up , about a foot and a half from the ground , with two or three ladders to mount it .
From this , one of them , who seemed to be a person of quality , made me a long speech , of which I could not understand a word , though I could tell from his manner that he sometimes threatened me , and sometimes spoke with pity and kindness .
I answered in few words , but in the most submissive manner ; and , being almost famished with hunger , I could not help showing my impatience by putting my finger frequently to my mouth , to signify that I wanted food .
He understood me very well , and , descending from the stage , commanded that several ladders should be set against my sides , on which more than a hundred of the inhabitants mounted , and walked toward my mouth with baskets full of food , which had been sent by the King 's orders when he first received tidings of me .
There were legs and shoulders like mutton but smaller than the wings of a lark .
I ate them two or three at a mouthful , and took three loaves at a time .
They supplied me as fast as they could , with a thousand marks of wonder at my appetite .
I then made a sign that I wanted something to drink .
They guessed that a small quantity would not suffice me , and , being a most ingenious people , they slung up one of their largest hogsheads , then rolled it toward my hand , and beat out the top .
I drank it off at a draught , which I might well do , for it did not hold half a pint .
They brought me a second hogshead , which I drank , and made signs for more ; but they had none to give me .
However , I could not wonder enough at the daring of these tiny mortals , who ventured to mount and walk upon my body , while one of my hands was free , without trembling at the very sight of so huge a creature as I must have seemed to them .
After some time there appeared before me a person of high rank from his Imperial Majesty .
His Excellency , having mounted my right leg , advanced to my face , with about a dozen of his retinue , and spoke about ten minutes , often pointing forward , which , as I afterward found , was toward the capital city , about half a mile distant , whither it was commanded by his Majesty that I should be conveyed .
I made a sign with my hand that was loose , putting it to the other -LRB- but over his Excellency 's head , for fear of hurting him or his train -RRB- , to show that I desired my liberty .
He seemed to understand me well enough , for he shook his head , though he made other signs to let me know that I should have meat and drink enough , and very good treatment .
Then I once more thought of attempting to escape ; but when I felt the smart of their arrows on my face and hands , which were all in blisters and observed likewise that the number of my enemies increased , I gave tokens to let them know that they might do with me what they pleased .
Then they daubed my face and hands with a sweet-smelling ointment , which in a few minutes removed all the smarts of the arrows .
The relief from pain and hunger made me drowsy , and presently I fell asleep .
I slept about eight hours , as I was told afterward ; and it was no wonder , for the physicians , by the Emperor 's orders , had mingled a sleeping draught in the hogsheads of wine .
It seems that , when I was discovered sleeping on the ground after my landing , the Emperor had early notice of it , and determined that I should be tied in the manner I have related -LRB- which was done in the night , while I slept -RRB- , that plenty of meat and drink should be sent me , and a machine prepared to carry me to the capital city .
Five hundred carpenters and engineers were immediately set to work to prepare the engine .
It was a frame of wood , raised three inches from the ground , about seven feet long and four wide , moving upon twenty-two wheels .
But the difficulty was to place me on it .
Eighty poles were erected for this purpose , and very strong cords fastened to bandages which the workmen had tied round my neck , hands , body , and legs .
Nine hundred of the strongest men were employed to draw up these cords by pulleys fastened on the poles , and in less than three hours I was raised and slung into the engine , and there tied fast .
Fifteen hundred of the Emperor 's largest horses , each about four inches and a half high , were then employed to draw me toward the capital .
But while all this was done I still lay in a deep sleep , and I did not wake till four hours after we began our journey .
The Emperor and all his Court came out to meet us when we reached the capital ; but his great officials would not suffer his Majesty to risk his person by mounting on my body .
Where the carriage stopped there stood an ancient temple , supposed to be the largest in the whole kingdom , and here it was determined that I should lodge .
Near the great gate , through which I could easily creep , they fixed ninety-one chains , like those which hang to a lady 's watch , which were locked to my left leg with thirty-six padlocks ; and when the workmen found it was impossible for me to break loose , they cut all the strings that bound me .
Then I rose up , feeling as melancholy as ever I did in my life .
But the noise and astonishment of the people on seeing me rise and walk were inexpressible .
The chains that held my left leg were about two yards long , and gave me not only freedom to walk backward and forward in a semicircle , but to creep in and lie at full length inside the temple .
The Emperor , advancing toward me from among his courtiers , all most magnificently clad , surveyed me with great admiration , but kept beyond the length of my chain .
He was taller by about the breadth of my nail than any of his Court , which alone was enough to strike awe into the beholders , and graceful and majestic .
The better to behold him , I lay down on my side , so that my face was level with his , and he stood three yards off .
However , I have had him since many times in my hand , and therefore can not be deceived .
His dress was very simple ; but he wore a light helmet of gold , adorned with jewels and a plume .
He held his sword drawn in his hand , to defend himself if I should break loose ; it was almost three inches long , and the hilt was of gold , enriched with diamonds .
His voice was shrill , but very clear .
His Imperial Majesty spoke often to me , and I answered ; but neither of us could understand a word .
CHAPTER II After about two hours the Court retired , and I was left with a strong guard to keep away the crowd , some of whom had had the impudence to shoot their arrows at me as I sat by the door of my house .
But the colonel ordered six of them to be seized and delivered bound into my hands .
I put five of them into my coat pocket ; and as to the sixth , I made a face as if I would eat him alive .
The poor man screamed terribly , and the colonel and his officers were much distressed , especially when they saw me take out my penknife .
But I soon set them at ease , for , cutting the strings he was bound with , I put him gently on the ground , and away he ran .
I treated the rest in the same manner , taking them one by one out of my pocket ; and I saw that both the soldiers and people were delighted at this mark of my kindness .
Toward night I got with some difficulty into my house , where I lay on the ground , as I had to do for a fortnight , till a bed was prepared for me out of six hundred beds of the ordinary measure .
Six hundred servants were appointed me , and three hundred tailors made me a suit of clothes .
Moreover , six of his Majesty 's greatest scholars were employed to teach me their language , so that soon I was able to converse after a fashion with the Emperor , who often honored me with his visits .
The first words I learned were to desire that he would please to give me my liberty , which I every day repeated on my knees ; but he answered that this must be a work of time , and that first I must swear a peace with him and his kingdom .
He told me also that by the laws of the nation I must be searched by two of his officers , and that as this could not be done without my help , he trusted them in my hands , and whatever they took from me should be returned when I left the country .
I took up the two officers , and put them into my coat pockets .
These gentlemen , having pen , ink , and paper about them , made an exact list of everything they saw , which I afterward translated into English , and which ran as follows : `` In the right coat pocket of the great Man-Mountain we found only one great piece of coarse cloth , large enough to cover the carpet of your Majesty 's chief room of state .
In the left pocket we saw a huge silver chest , with a silver cover , which we could not lift .
We desired that it should be opened , and one of us stepping into it found himself up to the mid-leg in a sort of dust , some of which flying into our faces sent us both into a fit of sneezing .
In his right waistcoat pocket we found a number of white thin substances , folded one over another , about the size of three men , tied with a strong cable , and marked with black figures , which we humbly conceive to be writings .
In the left there was a sort of engine , from the back of which extended twenty long poles , with which , we conjecture , the Man-Mountain combs his head .
In the smaller pocket on the right side were several round flat pieces of white and red metal , of different sizes .
Some of the white , which appeared to be silver , were so large and heavy that my comrade and I could hardly lift them .
From another pocket hung a huge silver chain , with a wonderful kind of engine fastened to it , a globe half silver and half of some transparent metal ; for on the transparent side we saw certain strange figures , and thought we could touch them till we found our fingers stopped by the shining substance .
This engine made an incessant noise , like a water-mill , and we conjecture it is either some unknown animal , or the god he worships , but probably the latter , for he told us that he seldom did anything without consulting it .
`` This is a list of what we found about the body of the Man-Mountain , who treated us with great civility . ''
I had one private pocket which escaped their search , containing a pair of spectacles and a small spy-glass , which , being of no consequence to the Emperor , I did not think myself bound in honor to discover .
CHAPTER III My gentleness and good behavior gained so far on the Emperor and his Court , and , indeed , on the people in general , that I began to have hopes of getting my liberty in a short time .
The natives came by degrees to be less fearful of danger from me .
I would sometimes lie down and let five or six of them dance on my hand ; and at last the boys and girls ventured to come and play at hide-and-seek in my hair .
The horses of the army and of the royal stables were no longer shy , having been daily led before me ; and one of the Emperor 's huntsmen , on a large courser , took my foot , shoe and all , which was indeed a prodigious leap .
I amused the Emperor one day in a very extraordinary manner .
I took nine sticks , and fixed them firmly in the ground in a square .
Then I took four other sticks , and tied them parallel at each corner , about two feet from the ground .
I fastened my handkerchief to the nine sticks that stood erect , and extended it on all sides till it was as tight as the top of a drum ; and I desired the Emperor to let a troop of his best horse , twenty-four in number , come and exercise upon this plain .
His majesty approved of the proposal , and I took them up one by one , with the proper officers to exercise them .
As soon as they got into order they divided into two parties , discharged blunt arrows , drew their swords , fled and pursued , and , in short , showed the best military discipline I ever beheld .
The parallel sticks secured them and their horses from falling off the stage , and the Emperor was so much delighted that he ordered this entertainment to be repeated several days , and persuaded the Empress herself to let me hold her in her chair within two yards of the stage , whence she could view the whole performance .
Fortunately no accident happened , only once a fiery horse , pawing with his hoof , struck a hole in my handkerchief , and overthrew his rider and himself .
But I immediately relieved them both , and covering the hole with one hand , I set down the troop with the other as I had taken them up .
The horse that fell was strained in the shoulder ; but the rider was not hurt , and I repaired my handkerchief as well as I could .
However , I would not trust to the strength of it any more in such dangerous enterprises .
I had sent so many petitions for my liberty that his Majesty at length mentioned the matter in a full council , where it was opposed by none except Skyresh Bolgolam , admiral of the realm , who was pleased without any provocation to be my mortal enemy .
However , he agreed at length , though he succeeded in himself drawing up the conditions on which I should be set free .
After they were read I was requested to swear to perform them in the method prescribed by their laws , which was to hold my right foot in my left hand , and to place the middle finger of my right hand on the crown of my head , and my thumb on the top of my right ear .
But I have made a translation of the conditions , which I here offer to the public : `` Golbaste Mamarem Evlame Gurdile Shefin Mully Ully Gue , Most Mighty Emperor of Lilliput , delight and terror of the universe , whose dominions extend to the ends of the globe , monarch of all monarchs , taller than the sons of men , whose feet press down to the center , and whose head strikes against the sun , at whose nod the princes of the earth shake their knees , pleasant as the spring , comfortable as the summer , fruitful as autumn , dreadful as winter : His Most Sublime Majesty proposeth to the Man-Mountain , lately arrived at our celestial dominions , the following articles , which by a solemn oath he shall be obliged to perform : `` First .
The Man-Mountain shall not depart from our dominions without our license under the great seal .
`` Second .
He shall not presume to come into our metropolis without our express order , at which time the inhabitants shall have two hours ' warning to keep within doors .
`` Third .
The said Man-Mountain shall confine his walks to our principal high roads , and not offer to walk or lie down in a meadow or field of corn .
`` Fourth .
As he walks the said roads he shall take the utmost care not to trample upon the bodies of any of our loving subjects , their horses or carriages , nor take any of our subjects into his hands without their own consent .
`` Fifth .
If an express requires extraordinary speed the Man-Mountain shall be obliged to carry in his pocket the messenger and horse a six days ' journey , and return the said messenger -LRB- if so required -RRB- safe to our imperial presence .
`` Sixth .
He shall be our ally against our enemies in the island of Blefuscu , and do his utmost to destroy their fleet , which is now preparing to invade us .
`` Lastly .
Upon his solemn oath to observe all the above articles , the said Man-Mountain shall have a daily allowance of meat and drink sufficient for the support of 1,724 of our subjects , with free access to our royal person , and other marks of our favor .
Given at our palace at Belfaburac , the twelfth day of the ninety-first moon of our reign . ''
I swore to these articles with great cheerfulness , whereupon my chains were immediately unlocked , and I was at full liberty .
One morning , about a fortnight after I had obtained my freedom , Reldresal , the Emperor 's secretary for private affairs , came to my house , attended only by one servant .
He ordered his coach to wait at a distance , and desired that I would give him an hour 's audience .
I offered to lie down that he might the more conveniently reach my ear ; but he chose rather to let me hold him in my hand during our conversation .
He began with compliments on my liberty , but he added that , save for the present state of things at Court , perhaps I might not have obtained it so soon .
`` For , '' he said , `` however flourishing we may seem to foreigners , we are in danger of an invasion from the island of Blefuscu , which is the other great empire of the universe , almost as large and as powerful as this of his Majesty .
For as to what we have heard you say , that there are other kingdoms in the world , inhabited by human creatures as large as yourself , our philosophers are very doubtful , and rather conjecture that you dropped from the moon , or one of the stars , because a hundred mortals of your size would soon destroy all the fruit and cattle of his Majesty 's dominions .
Besides , our histories of six thousand moons make no mention of any other regions than the two mighty empires of Lilliput and Blefuscu , which , as I was going to tell you , are engaged in a most obstinate war , which began in the following manner : It is allowed on all hands that the primitive way of breaking eggs was upon the larger end ; but his present Majesty 's grandfather , while he was a boy , going to eat an egg , and breaking it according to the ancient practice , happened to cut one of his fingers .
Whereupon the Emperor , his father , made a law commanding all his subjects to break the smaller end of their eggs .
The people so highly resented this law that there have been six rebellions raised on that account , wherein one emperor lost his life , and another his crown .
It is calculated that eleven hundred persons have at different times suffered rather than break their eggs at the smaller end .
But these rebels , the Bigendians , have found so much encouragement at the Emperor of Blefuscu 's Court , to which they always fled for refuge , that a bloody war , as I said , has been carried on between the two empires for six-and-thirty moons ; and now the Blefuscudians have equipped a large fleet , and are preparing to descend upon us .
Therefore his Imperial Majesty , placing great confidence in your valor and strength , has commanded me to set the case before you . ''
I desired the secretary to present my humble duty to the Emperor , and to let him know that I was ready , at the risk of my life , to defend him against all invaders .
CHAPTER IV It was not long before I communicated to his Majesty the plan I formed for seizing the enemy 's whole fleet .
The Empire of Blefuscu is an island parted from Lilliput only by a channel eight hundred yards wide .
I consulted the most experienced seamen on the depth of the channel , and they told me that in the middle , at high water , it was seventy glumguffs -LRB- about six feet of European measure -RRB- .
I walked toward the coast , where , lying down behind a hillock , I took out my spy-glass , and viewed the enemy 's fleet at anchor -- about fifty men-of-war , and other vessels .
I then came back to my house and gave orders for a great quantity of the strongest cables and bars of iron .
The cable was about as thick as packthread , and the bars of the length and size of a knitting-needle .
I trebled the cable to make it stronger , and for the same reason twisted three of the iron bars together , bending the ends into a hook .
Having thus fixed fifty hooks to as many cables , I went back to the coast , and taking off my coat , shoes , and stockings , walked into the sea in my leather jacket about half an hour before high water .
I waded with what haste I could , swimming in the middle about thirty yards , till I felt ground , and thus arrived at the fleet in less than half an hour .
The enemy was so frightened when they saw me that they leaped out of their ships and swam ashore , where there could not be fewer than thirty thousand .
Then , fastening a hook to the hole at the prow of each ship , I tied all the cords together at the end .
Meanwhile the enemy discharged several thousand arrows , many of which stuck in my hands and face .
My greatest fear was for my eyes , which I should have lost if I had not suddenly thought of the pair of spectacles which had escaped the Emperor 's searchers .
These I took out and fastened upon my nose , and thus armed went on with my work in spite of the arrows , many of which struck against the glasses of my spectacles , but without any other effect than slightly disturbing them .
Then , taking the knot in my hand , I began to pull ; but not a ship would stir , for they were too fast held by their anchors .
Thus the boldest part of my enterprise remained .
Letting go the cord , I resolutely cut with my knife the cables that fastened the anchors , receiving more than two hundred shots in my face and hands .
Then I took up again the knotted end of the cables to which my hooks were tied , and with great ease drew fifty of the enemy 's largest men-of-war after me .
When the Blefuscudians saw the fleet moving in order , and me pulling at the end , they set up a scream of grief and despair that it is impossible to describe .
When I had got out of danger I stopped awhile to pick out the arrows that stuck in my hands and face , and rubbed on some of the same ointment that was given me at my arrival .
I then took off my spectacles , and after waiting about an hour , till the tide was a little fallen , I waded on to the royal port of Lilliput .
The Emperor and his whole Court stood on the shore awaiting me .
They saw the ships move forward in a large half-moon , but could not discern me , who , in the middle of the channel , was under water up to my neck .
The Emperor concluded that I was drowned , and that the enemy 's fleet was approaching in a hostile manner .
But he was soon set at ease , for , the channel growing shallower every step I made , I came in a short time within hearing , and holding up the end of the cable by which the fleet was fastened , I cried in a loud voice : `` Long live the most puissant Emperor of Lilliput ! ''
The Prince received me at my landing with all possible joy , and made me a Nardal on the spot , which is the highest title of honor among them .
His Majesty desired that I would take some opportunity to bring all the rest of his enemy 's ships into his ports , and seemed to think of nothing less than conquering the whole Empire of Blefuscu , and becoming the sole monarch of the world .
But I plainly protested that I would never be the means of bringing a free and brave people into slavery ; and though the wisest of the Ministers were of my opinion , my open refusal was so opposed to his Majesty 's ambition that he could never forgive me .
And from this time a plot began between himself and those of his Ministers who were my enemies , that nearly ended in my utter destruction .
About three weeks after this exploit there arrived an embassy from Blefuscu , with humble offers of peace , which was soon concluded , on terms very advantageous to our Emperor .
There were six ambassadors , with a train of about five hundred persons , all very magnificent .
Having been privately told that I had befriended them , they made me a visit , and paying me many compliments on my valor and generosity , invited me to their kingdom in the Emperor their master 's name .
I asked them to present my most humble respects to the Emperor their master , whose royal person I resolved to attend before I returned to my own country .
Accordingly , the next time I had the honor to see our Emperor I desired his general permission to visit the Blefuscudian monarch .
This he granted me , but in a very cold manner , of which I afterward learned the reason .
When I was just preparing to pay my respects to the Emperor of Blefuscu , a distinguished person at Court , to whom I had once done a great service , came to my house very privately at night , and without sending his name desired admission .
I put his lordship into my coat pocket , and , giving orders to a trusty servant to admit no one , I fastened the door , placed my visitor on the table , and sat down by it .
His lordship 's face was full of trouble ; and he asked me to hear him with patience , in a matter that highly concerned my honor and my life .
`` You are aware , '' he said , `` that Skyresh Bolgolam has been your mortal enemy ever since your arrival , and his hatred is increased since your great success against Blefuscu , by which his glory as admiral is obscured .
This lord and others have accused you of treason , and several councils have been called in the most private manner on your account .
Out of gratitude for your favors I procured information of the whole proceedings , venturing my head for your service , and this was the charge against you : `` First , that you , having brought the imperial fleet of Blefuscu into the royal port , were commanded by his Majesty to seize all the other ships , and put to death all the Bigendian exiles , and also all the people of the empire who would not immediately consent to break their eggs at the smaller end .
And that , like a false traitor to his Most Serene Majesty , you excused yourself from the service on pretence of unwillingness to force the consciences and destroy the liberties and lives of an innocent people .
`` Again , when ambassadors arrived from the Court of Blefuscu , like a false traitor , you aided and entertained them , though you knew them to be servants of a prince lately in open war against his Imperial Majesty .
`` Moreover , you are now preparing , contrary to the duty of a faithful subject , to voyage to the Court of Blefuscu .
`` In the debate on this charge , '' my friend continued , `` his Majesty often urged the services you had done him , while the admiral and treasurer insisted that you should be put to a shameful death .
But Reldresal , secretary for private affairs , who has always proved himself your friend suggested that if his Majesty would please to spare your life and only give orders to put out both your eyes , justice might in some measure be satisfied .
At this Bolgolam rose up in fury , wondering how the secretary dared desire to preserve the life of a traitor ; and the treasurer , pointing out the expense of keeping you , also urged your death .
But his Majesty was graciously pleased to say that since the council thought the loss of your eyes too easy a punishment , some other might afterward be inflicted .
And the secretary , humbly desiring to be heard again , said that as to expense your allowance might be gradually lessened , so that , for want of sufficient food you should grow weak and faint , and die in a few months , when his Majesty 's subjects might cut your flesh from your bones and bury it , leaving the skeleton for the admiration of posterity .
`` Thus , through the great friendship of the secretary the affair was arranged .
It was commanded that the plan of starving you by degrees should be kept a secret ; but the sentence of putting out your eyes was entered on the books .
In three days your friend the secretary will come to your house and read the accusation before you , and point out the great mercy of his Majesty , that only condemns you to the loss of your eyes -- which , he does not doubt , you will submit to humbly and gratefully .
Twenty of his Majesty 's surgeons will attend , to see the operation well performed , by discharging very sharp-pointed arrows into the balls of your eyes as you lie on the ground .
`` I leave you , '' said my friend , `` to consider what measures you will take ; and , to escape suspicion , I must immediately return , as secretly as I came . ''
His lordship did so ; and I remained alone , in great perplexity .
At first I was bent on resistance ; for while I had liberty I could easily with stones pelt the metropolis to pieces ; but I soon rejected that idea with horror , remembering the oath I had made to the Emperor , and the favors I had received from him .
At last , having his Majesty 's leave to pay my respects to the Emperor of Blefuscu , I resolved to take this opportunity .
Before the three days had passed I wrote a letter to my friend the secretary telling him of my resolution ; and , without waiting for an answer , went to the coast , and entering the channel , between wading and swimming reached the port of Blefuscu , where the people , who had long expected me , led me to the capital .
His Majesty , with the royal family and great officers of the Court , came out to receive me , and they entertained me in a manner suited to the generosity of so great a prince .
I did not , however , mention my disgrace with the Emperor of Lilliput , since I did not suppose that prince would disclose the secret while I was out of his power .
But in this , it soon appeared , I was deceived .
CHAPTER V Three days after my arrival , walking out of curiosity to the northeast coast of the island , I observed at some distance in the sea something that looked like a boat overturned .
I pulled off my shoes and stockings , and wading two or three hundred yards , I plainly saw it to be a real boat , which I supposed might by some tempest have been driven from a ship .
I returned immediately to the city for help , and after a huge amount of labor I managed to get my boat to the royal port of Blefuscu , where a great crowd of people appeared , full of wonder at sight of so prodigious a vessel .
I told the Emperor that my good fortune had thrown this boat in my way to carry me to some place whence I might return to my native country , and begged his orders for materials to fit it up , and leave to depart -- which , after many kindly speeches , he was pleased to grant .
Meanwhile the Emperor of Lilliput , uneasy at my long absence -LRB- but never imagining that I had the least notice of his designs -RRB- , sent a person of rank to inform the Emperor of Blefuscu of my disgrace ; this messenger had orders to represent the great mercy of his master , who was content to punish me with the loss of my eyes , and who expected that his brother of Blefuscu would have me sent back to Lilliput , bound hand and foot , to be punished as a traitor .
The Emperor of Blefuscu answered with many civil excuses .
He said that as for sending me bound , his brother knew it was impossible .
Moreover , though I had taken away his fleet he was grateful to me for many good offices I had done him in making the peace .
But that both their Majesties would soon be made easy ; for I had found a prodigious vessel on the shore , able to carry me on the sea , which he had given orders to fit up ; and he hoped in a few weeks both empires would be free from me .
With this answer the messenger returned to Lilliput ; and I -LRB- though the monarch of Blefuscu secretly offered me his gracious protection if I would continue in his service -RRB- hastened my departure , resolving never more to put confidence in princes .
In about a month I was ready to take leave .
The Emperor of Blefuscu , with the Empress and the royal family , came out of the palace ; and I lay down on my face to kiss their hands , which they graciously gave me .
His Majesty presented me with fifty purses of sprugs -LRB- their greatest gold coin -RRB- and his picture at full length , which I put immediately into one of my gloves , to keep it from being hurt .
Many other ceremonies took place at my departure .
I stored the boat with meat and drink , and took six cows and two bulls alive , with as many ewes and rams , intending to carry them into my own country ; and to feed them on board , I had a good bundle of hay and a bag of corn .
I would gladly have taken a dozen of the natives ; but this was a thing the Emperor would by no means permit , and besides a diligent search into my pockets , his Majesty pledged my honor not to carry away any of his subjects , though with their own consent and desire .
Having thus prepared all things as well as I was able , I set sail .
When I had made twenty-four leagues , by my reckoning , from the island of Blefuscu , I saw a sail steering to the northeast .
I hailed her , but could get no answer ; yet I found I gained upon her , for the wind slackened ; and in half an hour she spied me , and discharged a gun .
I came up with her between five and six in the evening , Sept. 26 , 1701 ; but my heart leaped within me to see her English colors .
I put my cows and sheep into my coat pockets , and got on board with all my little cargo .
The captain received me with kindness , and asked me to tell him what place I came from last ; but at my answer he thought I was raving .
However , I took my black cattle and sheep out of my pocket , which , after great astonishment , clearly convinced him .
We arrived in England on the 13th of April , 1702 .
I stayed two months with my wife and family ; but my eager desire to see foreign countries would suffer me to remain no longer .
However , while in England I made great profit by showing my cattle to persons of quality and others ; and before I began my second voyage I sold them for 600_l .
I left 1500_l .
with my wife , and fixed her in a good house ; then taking leave of her and my boy and girl , with tears on both sides , I sailed on board the `` Adventure . ''

THE PRINCESS ON THE GLASS HILL Once upon a time there was a man who had a meadow which lay on the side of a mountain , and in the meadow there was a barn in which he stored hay .
But there had not been much hay in the barn for the last two years , for every St. John 's eve , when the grass was in the height of its vigor , it was all eaten clean up , just as if a whole flock of sheep had gnawed it down to the ground during the night .
This happened once , and it happened twice , but then the man got tired of losing his crop , and said to his sons -- he had three of them , and the third was called Cinderlad -- that one of them must go and sleep in the barn on St. John 's night , for it was absurd to let the grass be eaten up again , blade and stalk , as it had been the last two years , and the one who went to watch must keep a sharp look-out , the man said .
The eldest was quite willing to go to the meadow ; he would watch the grass , he said , and he would do it so well that neither man , nor beast , nor even the devil himself should have any of it .
So when evening came he went to the barn , and lay down to sleep , but when night was drawing near there was such a rumbling and such an earthquake that the walls and roof shook again , and the lad jumped up and took to his heels as fast as he could , and never even looked back , and the barn remained empty that year just as it had been for the last two .
Next St. John 's eve the man again said that he could not go on in this way , losing all the grass in the outlying field year after year , and that one of his sons must just go there and watch it , and watch well too .
So the next oldest son was willing to show what he could do .
He went to the barn and lay down to sleep , as his brother had done ; but when night was drawing near there was a great rumbling , and then an earthquake , which was even worse than that on the former St. John 's night , and when the youth heard it he was terrified , and went off , running as if for a wager .
The year after , it was Cinderlad 's turn , but when he made ready to go the others laughed at him , and mocked him .
`` Well , you are just the right one to watch the hay , you who have never learned anything but how to sit among the ashes and bake yourself ! ''
said they .
Cinderlad , however , did not trouble himself about what they said , but when evening drew near rambled away to the outlying field .
When he got there he went into the barn and lay down , but in about an hour 's time the rumbling and creaking began , and it was frightful to hear it .
`` Well , if it gets no worse than that , I can manage to stand it , '' thought Cinderlad .
In a little time the creaking began again , and the earth quaked so that all the hay flew about the boy .
`` Oh !
if it gets no worse than that I can manage to stand it , '' thought Cinderlad .
But then came a third rumbling , and a third earthquake , so violent that the boy thought the walls and roof had fallen down , but when that was over everything suddenly grew as still as death around him .
`` I am pretty sure that it will come again , '' thought Cinderlad ; but no , it did not .
Everything was quiet , and everything stayed quiet , and when he had lain still a short time he heard something that sounded as if a horse were standing chewing just outside the barn door .
He stole away to the door , which was ajar , to see what was there , and a horse was standing eating .
It was so big , and fat , and fine a horse that Cinderlad had never seen one like it before , and a saddle and bridle lay upon it , and a complete suit of armor for a knight , and everything was of copper , and so bright that it shone again .
`` Ha , ha !
it is thou who eatest up our hay then , '' thought the boy ; `` but I will stop that . ''
So he made haste , and took out his steel for striking fire , and threw it over the horse , and then it had no power to stir from the spot , and became so tame that the boy could do what he liked with it .
So he mounted it and rode away to a place which no one knew of but himself , and there he tied it up .
When he went home again his brothers laughed and asked how he had got on .
`` You did n't lie long in the barn , if even you have been so far as the field ! ''
said they .
`` I lay in the barn till the sun rose , but I saw nothing and heard nothing , not I , '' said the boy .
`` God knows what there was to make you two so frightened . ''
`` Well , we shall soon see whether you have watched the meadow or not , '' answered the brothers , but when they got there the grass was all standing just as long and as thick as it had been the night before .
The next St. John 's eve it was the same thing , once again : neither of the two brothers dared to go to the outlying field to watch the crop , but Cinderlad went , and everything happened exactly the same as on the previous St. John 's eve : first there was a rumbling and an earthquake , and then there was another , and then a third : but all three earthquakes were much , very much more violent than they had been the year before .
Then everything became still as death again , and the boy heard something chewing outside the barn door , so he stole as softly as he could to the door , which was slightly ajar , and again there was a horse standing close by the wall of the house , eating and chewing , and it was far larger and fatter than the first horse , and it had a saddle on its back , and a bridle was on it too , and a full suit of armor for a knight , all of bright silver , and as beautiful as anyone could wish to see .
`` Ho , ho ! ''
thought the boy , `` is it thou who eatest up our hay in the night ?
but I will put a stop to that . ''
So he took out his steel for striking fire , and threw it over the horse 's mane , and the beast stood there as quiet as a lamb .
Then the boy rode this horse , too , away to the place where he kept the other , and then went home again .
`` I suppose you will tell us that you have watched well again this time , '' said the brothers .
`` Well , so I have , '' said Cinderlad .
So they went there again , and there the grass was , standing as high and as thick as it had been before , but that did not make them any kinder to Cinderlad .
When the third St. John 's night came neither of the two elder brothers dared to lie in the outlying barn to watch the grass , for they had been so heartily frightened the night that they had slept there that they could not get over it , but Cinderlad dared to go , and everything happened just the same as on the two former nights .
There were three earthquakes , each worse than the other , and the last flung the boy from one wall of the barn to the other , but then everything suddenly became still as death .
When he had lain quietly a short time , he heard something chewing outside the barn door ; then he once more stole to the door , which was slightly ajar , and behold , a horse was standing just outside it , which was much larger and fatter than the two others he had caught .
`` Ho , ho !
it is thou , then , who art eating up our hay this time , '' thought the boy ; `` but I will put a stop to that . ''
So he pulled out his steel for striking fire , and threw it over the horse , and it stood as still as if it had been nailed to the field , and the boy could do just what he liked with it .
Then he mounted it and rode away to the place where he had the two others , and then he went home again .
Then the two brothers mocked him just as they had done before , and told him that they could see that he must have watched the grass very carefully that night , for he looked just as if he were walking in his sleep ; but Cinderlad did not trouble himself about that , but just bade them go to the field and see .
They did go , and this time too the grass was standing , looking as fine and as thick as ever .
The King of the country in which Cinderlad 's father dwelt had a daughter whom he would give to no one who could not ride up to the top of the glass hill , for there was a high , high hill of glass , slippery as ice , and it was close to the King 's palace .
Upon the very top of this the King 's daughter was to sit with three gold apples in her lap , and the man who could ride up and take the three golden apples should marry her , and have half the kingdom .
The King had this proclaimed in every church in the whole kingdom , and in many other kingdoms too .
The Princess was very beautiful , and all who saw her fell violently in love with her , even in spite of themselves .
So it is needless to say that all the princes and knights were eager to win her , and half the kingdom besides , and that for this cause they came riding thither from the very end of the world , dressed so splendidly that their raiments gleamed in the sunshine , and riding on horses which seemed to dance as they went , and there was not one of these princes who did not think that he was sure to win the Princess .
When the day appointed by the King had come , there was such a host of knights and princes under the glass hill that they seemed to swarm , and everyone who could walk or even creep was there too , to see who won the King 's daughter .
Cinderlad 's two brothers were there too , but they would not hear of letting him go with them , for he was so dirty and black with sleeping and grubbing among the ashes that they said everyone would laugh at them if they were seen in the company of such an oaf .
`` Well , then , I will go all alone by myself , '' said Cinderlad .
When the two brothers got to the glass hill , all the princes and knights were trying to ride up it , and their horses were in a foam ; but it was all in vain , for no sooner did the horses set foot upon the hill than down they slipped , and there was not one which could get even so much as a couple of yards up .
Nor was that strange , for the hill was as smooth as a glass window-pane , and as steep as the side of a house .
But they were all eager to win the King 's daughter and half the kingdom , so they rode and they slipped , and thus it went on .
At length all the horses were so tired that they could do no more , and so hot that the foam dropped from them and the riders were forced to give up the attempt .
The King was just thinking that he would cause it to be proclaimed that the riding should begin afresh on the following day , when perhaps it might go better , when suddenly a knight came riding up on so fine a horse that no one had ever seen the like of it before , and the knight had armor of copper , and his bridle was of copper too , and all his accoutrements were so bright that they shone again .
The other knights all called out to him that he might just as well spare himself the trouble of trying to ride up the glass hill , for it was of no use to try ; but he did not heed them , and rode straight off to it , and went up as if it were nothing at all .
Thus he rode for a long way -- it may have been a third part of the way up -- but when he had got so far he turned his horse round and rode down again .
But the Princess thought that she had never yet seen so handsome a knight , and while he was riding up she was sitting thinking , `` Oh !
how I hope he may be able to come up to the top ! ''
And when she saw that he was turning his horse back she threw one of the golden apples down after him , and it rolled into his shoe .
But when he had come down from off the hill he rode away , and that so fast that no one knew what had become of him .
So all the princes and knights were bidden to present themselves before the King that night , so that he who had ridden so far up the glass hill might show the golden apple which the King 's daughter had thrown down .
But no one had anything to show .
One knight presented himself after the other , and none could show the apple .
At night , too , Cinderlad 's brothers came home again and had a long story to tell about riding up the glass hill .
At first , they said , there was not one who was able to get even so much as one step up , but then came a knight who had armor of copper , and a bridle of copper , and his armor and trappings were so bright that they shone to a great distance , and it was something like a sight to see him riding .
He rode one-third of the way up the glass hill , and he could easily have ridden the whole of it if he had liked ; but he had turned back , for he had made up his mind that that was enough for once .
`` Oh !
I should have liked to see him too , that I should , '' said Cinderlad , who was as usual sitting by the chimney among the cinders .
`` You , indeed ! ''
said the brothers , `` you look as if you were fit to be among such great lords , nasty beast that you are to sit there ! ''
Next day the brothers were for setting out again , and this time too Cinderlad begged them to let him go with them and see who rode ; but no , they said he was not fit to do that , for he was much too ugly and dirty .
`` Well , well , then I will go all alone by myself , '' said Cinderlad .
So the brothers went to the glass hill , and all the princes and knights began to ride again , and this time they had taken care to roughen the shoes of their horses ; but that did not help them : they rode and they slipped as they had done the day before , and not one of them could get even so far as a yard up the hill .
When they had tired out their horses , so that they could do no more , they again had to stop altogether .
But just as the King was thinking that it would be well to proclaim that the riding should take place next day for the last time , so that they might have one more chance , he suddenly bethought himself that it would be well to wait a little longer to see if the knight in copper armor would come on this day too .
But nothing was to be seen of him .
Just as they were still looking for him , however , came a knight riding on a steed that was much , much finer than that which the knight in copper armor had ridden , and this knight had silver armor and a silver saddle and bridle , and all were so bright that they shone and glistened when he was a long way off .
Again the other knights called to him , and said that he might just as well give up the attempt to ride up the glass hill , for it was useless to try ; but the knight paid no heed to that , but rode straight away to the glass hill , and went still farther up than the knight in copper armor had gone ; but when he had ridden two-thirds of the way up he turned his horse around , and rode down again .
The Princess liked this knight still better than she had liked the other , and sat longing that he might be able to get up above , and when she saw him turning back she threw the second apple after him , and it rolled into his shoe , and as soon as he had got down the glass hill he rode away so fast that no one could see what had become of him .
In the evening , when everyone was to appear before the King and Princess , in order that he who had the golden apple might show it , one knight went in after the other , but none of them had a golden apple to show .
At night the two brothers went home as they had done the night before , and told how things had gone , and how everyone had ridden , but no one had been able to get up the hill .
`` But last of all , '' they said , `` came one in silver armor , and he had a silver bridle on his horse , and a silver saddle , and oh , but he could ride !
He took his horse two-thirds of the way up the hill , but then he turned back .
He was a fine fellow , '' said the brothers , `` and the Princess threw the second golden apple to him ! ''
`` Oh , how I should have liked to see him too ! ''
said Cinderlad .
`` Oh , indeed !
He was a little brighter than the ashes that you sit grubbing among , you dirty black creature ! ''
said the brothers .
On the third day everything went just as on the former days .
Cinderlad wanted to go with them to look at the riding , but the two brothers would not have him in their company , and when they got to the glass hill there was no one who could ride even so far as a yard up it , and everyone waited for the knight in silver armor , but he was neither to be seen nor heard of .
At last , after a long time , came a knight riding upon a horse that was such a fine one , its equal had never yet been seen .
The knight had golden armor , and the horse a golden saddle and bridle , and these were all so bright that they shone and dazzled everyone , even while the knight was still at a great distance .
The other princes and knights were not able even to call to tell him how useless it was to try to ascend the hill , so amazed were they at sight of his magnificence .
He rode straight away to the glass hill , and galloped up it as if it were no hill at all , so that the Princess had not even time to wish that he might get up the whole way .
As soon as he had ridden to the top , he took the third golden apple from the lap of the Princess and then turned his horse about and rode down again , and vanished from their sight before anyone was able to say a word to him .
When the two brothers came home again at night they had much to tell of how the riding had gone off that day , and at last they told about the knight in the golden armor too .
`` He was a fine fellow , that was !
Such another splendid knight is not to be found on earth ! ''
said the brothers .
`` Oh , how I should have liked to see him too ! ''
said Cinderlad .
`` Well , he shone nearly as brightly as the coal-heaps that thou art always lying raking among , dirty black creature that thou art ! ''
said the brothers .
Next day all the knights and princes were to appear before the King and Princess -- it had been too late for them to do it the night before -- in order that he who had the golden apple might produce it .
They all went in turn , first princes , and then knights , but none of them had a golden apple .
`` But somebody must have it , '' said the King , `` for with our own eyes we all saw a man ride up and take it . ''
So he commanded that everyone in the kingdom should come to the palace , and see if he could show the apple .
And one after the other they all came , but no one had the golden apple , and after a long , long time Cinderlad 's two brothers came likewise .
They were the last of all , so the King inquired of them if there was no one else in the kingdom left to come .
`` Oh !
yes , we have a brother , '' said the two , `` but he never got the golden apple !
He never left the cinder-heap on any of the three days . ''
`` Never mind that , '' said the King ; `` as everyone else has come to the palace , let him come too . ''
So Cinderlad was forced to go to the King 's palace .
`` Hast thou the golden apple ? ''
asked the King .
`` Yes , here is the first , and here is the second , and here is the third , too , '' said Cinderlad , and he took all three apples out of his pocket , and with that drew off his sooty rags , and appeared there before them in his bright golden armor , which gleamed as he stood .
`` Thou shalt have my daughter , and the half of my kingdom , and thou hast well earned both ! ''
said the King .
So there was a wedding , and Cinderlad got the King 's daughter , and everyone made merry at the wedding , for all of them could make merry , though they could not ride up the glass hill , and if they have not left off their merry-making they must be at it still .

THE STORY OF PRINCE AHMED AND THE FAIRY PARIBANOU There was a sultan , who had three sons and a niece .
The eldest of the Princes was called Houssain , the second Ali , the youngest Ahmed , and the Princess , his niece , Nouronnihar .
The Princess Nouronnihar was the daughter of the younger brother of the Sultan , who died , and left the Princess very young .
The Sultan took upon himself the care of his daughter 's education , and brought her up in his palace with the three Princes , proposing to marry her when she arrived at a proper age , and to contract an alliance with some neighboring prince by that means .
But when he perceived that the three Princes , his sons , loved her passionately , he thought more seriously on that affair .
He was very much concerned ; the difficulty he foresaw was to make them agree , and that the two youngest should consent to yield her up to their elder brother .
As he found them positively obstinate , he sent for them all together , and said to them : `` Children , since for your good and quiet I have not been able to persuade you no longer to aspire to the Princess , your cousin , I think it would not be amiss if every one traveled separately into different countries , so that you might not meet each other .
And , as you know I am very curious , and delight in everything that 's singular , I promise my niece in marriage to him that shall bring me the most extraordinary rarity ; and for the purchase of the rarity you shall go in search after , and the expense of traveling , I will give you every one a sum of money . ''
As the three Princes were always submissive and obedient to the Sultan 's will , and each flattered himself fortune might prove favorable to him , they all consented to it .
The Sultan paid them the money he promised them ; and that very day they gave orders for the preparations for their travels , and took their leave of the Sultan , that they might be the more ready to go the next morning .
Accordingly they all set out at the same gate of the city , each dressed like a merchant , attended by an officer of confidence dressed like a slave , and all well mounted and equipped .
They went the first day 's journey together , and lay all at an inn , where the road was divided into three different tracts .
At night , when they were at supper together , they all agreed to travel for a year , and to meet at that inn ; and that the first that came should wait for the rest ; that , as they had all three taken their leave together of the Sultan , they might all return together .
The next morning by break of day , after they had embraced and wished each other good success , they mounted their horses and took each a different road .
Prince Houssain , the eldest brother , arrived at Bisnagar , the capital of the kingdom of that name , and the residence of its king .
He went and lodged at a khan appointed for foreign merchants ; and , having learned that there were four principal divisions where merchants of all sorts sold their commodities , and kept shops , and in the midst of which stood the castle , or rather the King 's palace , he went to one of these divisions the next day .
Prince Houssain could not view this division without admiration .
It was large , and divided into several streets , all vaulted and shaded from the sun , and yet very light too .
The shops were all of a size , and all that dealt in the same sort of goods lived in one street ; as also the handicrafts-men , who kept their shops in the smaller streets .
The multitude of shops , stocked with all sorts of merchandise , as the finest linens from several parts of India , some painted in the most lively colors , and representing beasts , trees , and flowers ; silks and brocades from Persia , China , and other places , porcelain both from Japan and China , and tapestries , surprised him so much that he knew not how to believe his own eyes ; but when he came to the goldsmiths and jewelers he was in a kind of ecstacy to behold such prodigious quantities of wrought gold and silver , and was dazzled by the lustre of the pearls , diamonds , rubies , emeralds , and other jewels exposed to sale .
Another thing Prince Houssain particularly admired was the great number of rose-sellers who crowded the streets ; for the Indians are so great lovers of that flower that no one will stir without a nosegay in his hand or a garland on his head ; and the merchants keep them in pots in their shops , that the air is perfectly perfumed .
After Prince Houssain had run through that division , street by street , his thoughts fully employed on the riches he had seen , he was very much tired , which a merchant perceiving , civilly invited him to sit down in his shop , and he accepted ; but had not been sat down long before he saw a crier pass by with a piece of tapestry on his arm , about six feet square , and cried at thirty purses .
The Prince called to the crier , and asked to see the tapestry , which seemed to him to be valued at an exorbitant price , not only for the size of it , but the meanness of the stuff ; when he had examined it well , he told the crier that he could not comprehend how so small a piece of tapestry , and of so indifferent appearance , could be set at so high a price .
The crier , who took him for a merchant , replied : `` If this price seems so extravagant to you , your amazement will be greater when I tell you I have orders to raise it to forty purses , and not to part with it under . ''
`` Certainly , '' answered Prince Houssain , `` it must have something very extraordinary in it , which I know nothing of . ''
`` You have guessed it , sir , '' replied the crier , `` and will own it when you come to know that whoever sits on this piece of tapestry may be transported in an instant wherever he desires to be , without being stopped by any obstacle . ''
At this discourse of the crier the Prince of the Indies , considering that the principal motive of his travel was to carry the Sultan , his father , home some singular rarity , thought that he could not meet with any which could give him more satisfaction .
`` If the tapestry , '' said he to the crier , `` has the virtue you assign it , I shall not think forty purses too much , but shall make you a present besides . ''
`` Sir , '' replied the crier , `` I have told you the truth ; and it is an easy matter to convince you of it , as soon as you have made the bargain for forty purses , on condition I show you the experiment .
But , as I suppose you have not so much about you , and to receive them I must go with you to your khan , where you lodge , with the leave of the master of the shop , we will go into the back shop , and I will spread the tapestry ; and when we have both sat down , and you have formed the wish to be transported into your apartment of the khan , if we are not transported thither it shall be no bargain , and you shall be at your liberty .
As to your present , though I am paid for my trouble by the seller , I shall receive it as a favor , and be very much obliged to you , and thankful . ''
On the credit of the crier , the Prince accepted the conditions , and concluded the bargain ; and , having got the master 's leave , they went into his back shop ; they both sat down on it , and as soon as the Prince formed his wish to be transported into his apartment at the khan he presently found himself and the crier there ; and , as he wanted not a more sufficient proof of the virtue of the tapestry , he counted the crier out forty pieces of gold , and gave him twenty pieces for himself .
In this manner Prince Houssain became the possessor of the tapestry , and was overjoyed that at his arrival at Bisnagar he had found so rare a piece , which he never disputed would gain him the hand of Nouronnihar .
In short , he looked upon it as an impossible thing for the Princes his younger brothers to meet with anything to be compared with it .
It was in his power , by sitting on his tapestry , to be at the place of meeting that very day ; but , as he was obliged to stay there for his brothers , as they had agreed , and as he was curious to see the King of Bisnagar and his Court , and to inform himself of the strength , laws , customs , and religion of the kingdom , he chose to make a longer abode there , and to spend some months in satisfying his curiosity .
Prince Houssain might have made a longer abode in the kingdom and Court of Bisnagar , but he was so eager to be nearer the Princess that , spreading the tapestry , he and the officer he had brought with him sat down , and as soon as he had formed his wish were transported to the inn at which he and his brothers were to meet , and where he passed for a merchant till they came .
Prince Ali , Prince Houssain 's second brother , who designed to travel into Persia , took the road , having three days after he parted with his brothers joined a caravan , and after four days ' travel arrived at Schiraz , which was the capital of the kingdom of Persia .
Here he passed for a jeweler .
The next morning Prince Ali , who traveled only for his pleasure , and had brought nothing but just necessaries along with him , after he had dressed himself , took a walk into that part of the town which they at Schiraz called the bezestein .
Among all the criers who passed backward and forward with several sorts of goods , offering to sell them , he was not a little surprised to see one who held an ivory telescope in his hand of about a foot in length and the thickness of a man 's thumb , and cried it at thirty purses .
At first he thought the crier mad , and to inform himself went to a shop , and said to the merchant , who stood at the door : `` Pray , sir , is not that man '' -LRB- pointing to the crier who cried the ivory perspective glass at thirty purses -RRB- `` mad ?
If he is not , I am very much deceived . ''
`` Indeed , sir , '' answered the merchant , `` he was in his right senses yesterday ; I can assure you he is one of the ablest criers we have , and the most employed of any when anything valuable is to be sold .
And if he cries the ivory perspective glass at thirty purses it must be worth as much or more , on some account or other .
He will come by presently , and we will call him , and you shall be satisfied ; in the meantime sit down on my sofa , and rest yourself . ''
Prince Ali accepted the merchant 's obliging offer , and presently afterward the crier passed by .
The merchant called him by his name , and , pointing to the Prince , said to him : `` Tell that gentleman , who asked me if you were in your right senses , what you mean by crying that ivory perspective glass , which seems not to be worth much , at thirty purses .
I should be very much amazed myself if I did not know you . ''
The crier , addressing himself to Prince Ali , said : `` Sir , you are not the only person that takes me for a madman on account of this perspective glass .
You shall judge yourself whether I am or no , when I have told you its property and I hope you will value it at as high a price as those I have showed it to already , who had as bad an opinion of me as you .
`` First , sir , '' pursued the crier , presenting the ivory pipe to the Prince , `` observe that this pipe is furnished with a glass at both ends ; and consider that by looking through one of them you see whatever object you wish to behold . ''
`` I am , '' said the Prince , `` ready to make you all imaginable reparation for the scandal I have thrown on you if you will make the truth of what you advance appear , '' and as he had the ivory pipe in his hand , after he had looked at the two glasses he said : `` Show me at which of these ends I must look that I may be satisfied . ''
The crier presently showed him , and he looked through , wishing at the same time to see the Sultan his father , whom he immediately beheld in perfect health , set on his throne , in the midst of his council .
Afterward , as there was nothing in the world so dear to him , after the Sultan , as the Princess Nouronnihar , he wished to see her ; and saw her at her toilet laughing , and in a pleasant humor , with her women about her .
Prince Ali wanted no other proof to be persuaded that this perspective glass was the most valuable thing in the world , and believed that if he should neglect to purchase it he should never meet again with such another rarity .
He therefore took the crier with him to the khan where he lodged , and counted him out the money , and received the perspective glass .
Prince Ali was overjoyed at his bargain , and persuaded himself that , as his brothers would not be able to meet with anything so rare and admirable , the Princess Nouronnihar would be the recompense of his fatigue and trouble ; that he thought of nothing but visiting the Court of Persia incognito , and seeing whatever was curious in Schiraz and thereabouts , till the caravan with which he came returned back to the Indies .
As soon as the caravan was ready to set out , the Prince joined them , and arrived happily without any accident or trouble , otherwise than the length of the journey and fatigue of traveling , at the place of rendezvous , where he found Prince Houssain , and both waited for Prince Ahmed .
Prince Ahmed , who took the road of Samarcand , the next day after his arrival there went , as his brothers had done , into the bezestein , where he had not walked long but heard a crier , who had an artificial apple in his hand , cry it at five and thirty purses ; upon which he stopped the crier , and said to him : `` Let me see that apple , and tell me what virtue and extraordinary properties it has , to be valued at so high a rate . ''
`` Sir , '' said the crier , giving it into his hand , `` if you look at the outside of this apple , it is very worthless , but if you consider its properties , virtues , and the great use and benefit it is to mankind , you will say it is no price for it , and that he who possesses it is master of a great treasure .
In short , it cures all sick persons of the most mortal diseases ; and if the patient is dying it will recover him immediately and restore him to perfect health ; and this is done after the easiest manner in the world , which is by the patient 's smelling the apple . ''
`` If I may believe you , '' replied Prince Ahmed , `` the virtues of this apple are wonderful , and it is invaluable ; but what ground have I , for all you tell me , to be persuaded of the truth of this matter ? ''
`` Sir , '' replied the crier , `` the thing is known and averred by the whole city of Samarcand ; but , without going any further , ask all these merchants you see here , and hear what they say .
You will find several of them will tell you they had not been alive this day if they had not made use of this excellent remedy .
And , that you may better comprehend what it is , I must tell you it is the fruit of the study and experiments of a celebrated philosopher of this city , who applied himself all his lifetime to the study and knowledge of the virtues of plants and minerals , and at last attained to this composition , by which he performed such surprising cures in this town as will never be forgot , but died suddenly himself , before he could apply his sovereign remedy , and left his wife and a great many young children behind him , in very indifferent circumstances , who , to support her family and provide for her children , is resolved to sell it . ''
While the crier informed Prince Ahmed of the virtues of the artificial apple , a great many persons came about them and confirmed what he said ; and one among the rest said he had a friend dangerously ill , whose life was despaired of ; and that was a favorable opportunity to show Prince Ahmed the experiment .
Upon which Prince Ahmed told the crier he would give him forty purses if he cured the sick person .
The crier , who had orders to sell it at that price , said to Prince Ahmed : `` Come , sir , let us go and make the experiment , and the apple shall be yours ; and I can assure you that it will always have the desired effect . ''
In short , the experiment succeeded , and the Prince , after he had counted out to the crier forty purses , and he had delivered the apple to him , waited patiently for the first caravan that should return to the Indies , and arrived in perfect health at the inn where the Princes Houssain and Ali waited for him .
When the Princes met they showed each other their treasures , and immediately saw through the glass that the Princess was dying .
They then sat down on the carpet , wished themselves with her , and were there in a moment .
Prince Ahmed no sooner perceived himself in Nouronnihar 's chamber than he rose off the tapestry , as did also the other two Princes , and went to the bedside , and put the apple under her nose ; some moments after the Princess opened her eyes , and turned her head from one side to another , looking at the persons who stood about her ; and then rose up in the bed , and asked to be dressed , just as if she had waked out of a sound sleep .
Her women having presently informed her , in a manner that showed their joy , that she was obliged to the three Princes for the sudden recovery of her health , and particularly to Prince Ahmed , she immediately expressed her joy to see them , and thanked them all together , and afterward Prince Ahmed in particular .
While the Princess was dressing the Princes went to throw themselves at the Sultan their father 's feet , and pay their respects to him .
But when they came before him they found he had been informed of their arrival by the chief of the Princess 's eunuchs , and by what means the Princess had been perfectly cured .
The Sultan received and embraced them with the greatest joy , both for their return and the recovery of the Princess his niece , whom he loved as well as if she had been his own daughter , and who had been given over by the physicians .
After the usual ceremonies and compliments the Princes presented each his rarity : Prince Houssain his tapestry , which he had taken care not to leave behind him in the Princess 's chamber ; Prince Ali his ivory perspective glass , and Prince Ahmed his artificial apple ; and after each had commended their present , when they put it into the Sultan 's hands , they begged of him to pronounce their fate , and declare to which of them he would give the Princess Nouronnihar for a wife , according to his promise .
The Sultan of the Indies , having heard , without interrupting them , all that the Princes could represent further about their rarities , and being well informed of what had happened in relation to the Princess Nouronnihar 's cure , remained some time silent , as if he were thinking on what answer he should make .
At last he broke the silence , and said to them : `` I would declare for one of you children with a great deal of pleasure if I could do it with justice ; but consider whether I can do it or no .
'T is true , Prince Ahmed , the Princess my niece is obliged to your artificial apple for her cure ; but I must ask you whether or no you could have been so serviceable to her if you had not known by Prince Ali 's perspective glass the danger she was in , and if Prince Houssain 's tapestry had not brought you so soon .
Your perspective glass , Prince Ali , informed you and your brothers that you were like to lose the Princess your cousin , and there you must own a great obligation .
`` You must also grant that that knowledge would have been of no service without the artificial apple and the tapestry .
And lastly , Prince Houssain , the Princess would be very ungrateful if she should not show her acknowledgment of the service of your tapestry , which was so necessary a means toward her cure .
But consider , it would have been of little use if you had not been acquainted with the Princess 's illness by Prince Ali 's glass , and Prince Ahmed had not applied his artificial apple .
Therefore , as neither tapestry , ivory perspective glass , nor artificial apple have the least preference one before the other , but , on the contrary , there 's a perfect equality , I can not grant the Princess to any one of you ; and the only fruit you have reaped from your travels is the glory of having equally contributed to restore her health .
`` If all this be true , '' added the Sultan , `` you see that I must have recourse to other means to determine certainly in the choice I ought to make among you ; and that , as there is time enough between this and night , I 'll do it to-day .
Go and get each of you a bow and arrow , and repair to the great plain , where they exercise horses .
I 'll soon come to you , and declare I will give the Princess Nouronnihar to him that shoots the farthest . ''
The three Princes had nothing to say against the decision of the Sultan .
When they were out of his presence they each provided themselves with a bow and arrow , which they delivered to one of their officers , and went to the plain appointed , followed by a great concourse of people .
The Sultan did not make them wait long for him , and as soon as he arrived Prince Houssain , as the eldest , took his bow and arrow and shot first ; Prince Ali shot next , and much beyond him ; and Prince Ahmed last of all , but it so happened that nobody could see where his arrow fell ; and , notwithstanding all the diligence that was used by himself and everybody else , it was not to be found far or near .
And though it was believed that he shot the farthest , and that he therefore deserved the Princess Nouronnihar , it was , however , necessary that his arrow should be found to make the matter more evident and certain ; and , notwithstanding his remonstrance , the Sultan judged in favor of Prince Ali , and gave orders for preparations to be made for the wedding , which was celebrated a few days after with great magnificence .
Prince Houssain would not honor the feast with his presence .
In short , his grief was so violent and insupportable that he left the Court , and renounced all right of succession to the crown , to turn hermit .
Prince Ahmed , too , did not come to Prince Ali 's and the Princess Nouronnihar 's wedding any more than his brother Houssain , but did not renounce the world as he had done .
But , as he could not imagine what had become of his arrow , he stole away from his attendants and resolved to search after it , that he might not have anything to reproach himself with .
With this intent he went to the place where the Princes Houssain 's and Ali 's were gathered up , and , going straight forward from there , looking carefully on both sides of him , he went so far that at last he began to think his labor was all in vain ; but yet he could not help going forward till he came to some steep craggy rocks , which were bounds to his journey , and were situated in a barren country , about four leagues distant from where he set out .
II When Prince Ahmed came pretty nigh to these rocks he perceived an arrow , which he gathered up , looked earnestly at it , and was in the greatest astonishment to find it was the same he shot away .
`` Certainly , '' said he to himself , `` neither I nor any man living could shoot an arrow so far , '' and , finding it laid flat , not sticking into the ground , he judged that it rebounded against the rock .
`` There must be some mystery in this , '' said he to himself again , `` and it may be advantageous to me .
Perhaps fortune , to make me amends for depriving me of what I thought the greatest happiness , may have reserved a greater blessing for my comfort . ''
As these rocks were full of caves and some of those caves were deep , the Prince entered into one , and , looking about , cast his eyes on an iron door , which seemed to have no lock , but he feared it was fastened .
However , thrusting against it , it opened , and discovered an easy descent , but no steps , which he walked down with his arrow in his hand .
At first he thought he was going into a dark , obscure place , but presently a quite different light succeeded that which he came out of , and , entering into a large , spacious place , at about fifty or sixty paces distant , he perceived a magnificent palace , which he had not then time enough to look at .
At the same time a lady of majestic port and air advanced as far as the porch , attended by a large troop of ladies , so finely dressed and beautiful that it was difficult to distinguish which was the mistress .
As soon as Prince Ahmed perceived the lady , he made all imaginable haste to go and pay his respects ; and the lady , on her part , seeing him coming , prevented him from addressing his discourse to her first , but said to him : `` Come nearer , Prince Ahmed , you are welcome . ''
It was no small surprise to the Prince to hear himself named in a place he had never heard of , though so nigh to his father 's capital , and he could not comprehend how he should be known to a lady who was a stranger to him .
At last he returned the lady 's compliment by throwing himself at her feet , and , rising up again , said to her : `` Madam , I return you a thousand thanks for the assurance you give me of a welcome to a place where I believed my imprudent curiosity had made me penetrate too far .
But , madam , may I , without being guilty of ill manners , dare to ask you by what adventure you know me ?
and how you , who live in the same neighborhood with me , should be so great a stranger to me ? ''
`` Prince , '' said the lady , `` let us go into the hall , there I will gratify you in your request . ''
After these words the lady led Prince Ahmed into the hall .
Then she sat down on a sofa , and when the Prince by her entreaty had done the same she said : `` You are surprised , you say , that I should know you and not be known by you , but you will be no longer surprised when I inform you who I am .
You are undoubtedly sensible that your religion teaches you to believe that the world is inhabited by genies as well as men .
I am the daughter of one of the most powerful and distinguished genies , and my name is Paribanou .
The only thing that I have to add is , that you seemed to me worthy of a more happy fate than that of possessing the Princess Nouronnihar ; and , that you might attain to it , I was present when you drew your arrow , and foresaw it would not go beyond Prince Houssain 's .
I took it in the air , and gave it the necessary motion to strike against the rocks near which you found it , and I tell you that it lies in your power to make use of the favorable opportunity which presents itself to make you happy . ''
As the Fairy Paribanou pronounced these last words with a different tone , and looked , at the same time , tenderly upon Prince Ahmed , with a modest blush on her cheeks , it was no hard matter for the Prince to comprehend what happiness she meant .
He presently considered that the Princess Nouronnihar could never be his and that the Fairy Paribanou excelled her infinitely in beauty , agreeableness , wit , and , as much as he could conjecture by the magnificence of the palace , in immense riches .
He blessed the moment that he thought of seeking after his arrow a second time , and , yielding to his love , `` Madam , '' replied he , `` should I all my life have the happiness of being your slave , and the admirer of the many charms which ravish my soul , I should think myself the most blessed of men .
Pardon in me the boldness which inspires me to ask this favor , and do n't refuse to admit me into your Court , a prince who is entirely devoted to you . ''
`` Prince , '' answered the Fairy , `` will you not pledge your faith to me , as well as I give mine to you ? ''
`` Yes , madam , '' replied the Prince , in an ecstacy of joy ; `` what can I do better , and with greater pleasure ?
Yes , my sultaness , my queen , I 'll give you my heart without the least reserve . ''
`` Then , '' answered the Fairy , `` you are my husband , and I am your wife .
But , as I suppose , '' pursued she , `` that you have eaten nothing to-day , a slight repast shall be served up for you , while preparations are making for our wedding feast at night , and then I will show you the apartments of my palace , and you shall judge if this hall is not the meanest part of it . ''
Some of the Fairy 's women , who came into the hall with them , and guessed her intentions , went immediately out , and returned presently with some excellent meats and wines .
When Prince Ahmed had ate and drunk as much as he cared for , the Fairy Paribanou carried him through all the apartments , where he saw diamonds , rubies , emeralds and all sorts of fine jewels , intermixed with pearls , agate , jasper , porphyry , and all sorts of the most precious marbles .
But , not to mention the richness of the furniture , which was inestimable , there was such a profuseness throughout that the Prince , instead of ever having seen anything like it , owned that he could not have imagined that there was anything in the world that could come up to it .
`` Prince , '' said the Fairy , `` if you admire my palace so much , which , indeed , is very beautiful , what would you say to the palaces of the chief of our genies , which are much more beautiful , spacious , and magnificent ?
I could also charm you with my gardens , but we will let that alone till another time .
Night draws near , and it will be time to go to supper . ''
The next hall which the Fairy led the Prince into , and where the cloth was laid for the feast , was the last apartment the Prince had not seen , and not in the least inferior to the others .
At his entrance into it he admired the infinite number of sconces of wax candles perfumed with amber , the multitude of which , instead of being confused , were placed with so just a symmetry as formed an agreeable and pleasant sight .
A large side table was set out with all sorts of gold plate , so finely wrought that the workmanship was much more valuable than the weight of the gold .
Several choruses of beautiful women richly dressed , and whose voices were ravishing , began a concert , accompanied with all sorts of the most harmonious instruments ; and when they were set down at table the Fairy Paribanou took care to help Prince Ahmed to the most delicate meats , which she named as she invited him to eat of them , and which the Prince found to be so exquisitely nice that he commended them with exaggeration , and said that the entertainment far surpassed those of man .
He found also the same excellence in the wines , which neither he nor the Fairy tasted of till the dessert was served up , which consisted of the choicest sweetmeats and fruits .
The wedding feast was continued the next day , or , rather , the days following the celebration were a continual feast .
At the end of six months Prince Ahmed , who always loved and honored the Sultan his father , conceived a great desire to know how he was , and that desire could not be satisfied without his going to see ; he told the Fairy of it , and desired she would give him leave .
`` Prince , '' said she , `` go when you please .
But first , do n't take it amiss that I give you some advice how you shall behave yourself where you are going .
First , I do n't think it proper for you to tell the Sultan your father of our marriage , nor of my quality , nor the place where you have been .
Beg of him to be satisfied in knowing you are happy , and desire no more ; and let him know that the sole end of your visit is to make him easy , and inform him of your fate . ''
She appointed twenty gentlemen , well mounted and equipped , to attend him .
When all was ready Prince Ahmed took his leave of the Fairy , embraced her , and renewed his promise to return soon .
Then his horse , which was most finely caparisoned , and was as beautiful a creature as any in the Sultan of Indies ' stables , was led to him , and he mounted him with an extraordinary grace ; and , after he had bid her a last adieu , set forward on his journey .
As it was not a great way to his father 's capital , Prince Ahmed soon arrived there .
The people , glad to see him again , received him with acclamations of joy , and followed him in crowds to the Sultan 's apartment .
The Sultan received and embraced him with great joy , complaining at the same time , with a fatherly tenderness , of the affliction his long absence had been to him , which he said was the more grievous for that , fortune having decided in favor of Prince Ali his brother , he was afraid he might have committed some rash action .
The Prince told a story of his adventures without speaking of the Fairy , whom he said that he must not mention , and ended : `` The only favor I ask of your Majesty is to give me leave to come often and pay you my respects , and to know how you do . ''
`` Son , '' answered the Sultan of the Indies , `` I can not refuse you the leave you ask me ; but I should much rather you would resolve to stay with me ; at least tell me where I may send to you if you should fail to come , or when I may think your presence necessary . ''
`` Sir , '' replied Prince Ahmed , `` what your Majesty asks of me is part of the mystery I spoke to your Majesty of .
I beg of you to give me leave to remain silent on this head , for I shall come so frequently that I am afraid that I shall sooner be thought troublesome than be accused of negligence in my duty . ''
The Sultan of the Indies pressed Prince Ahmed no more , but said to him : `` Son , I penetrate no farther into your secrets , but leave you at your liberty ; but can tell you that you could not do me a greater pleasure than to come , and by your presence restore to me the joy I have not felt this long time , and that you shall always be welcome when you come , without interrupting your business or pleasure . ''
Prince Ahmed stayed but three days at the Sultan his father 's Court , and the fourth returned to the Fairy Paribanou , who did not expect him so soon .
A month after Prince Ahmed 's return from paying a visit to his father , as the Fairy Paribanou had observed that the Prince , since the time that he gave her an account of his journey , his discourse with his father , and the leave he asked to go and see him often , had never talked of the Sultan , as if there had been no such person in the world , whereas before he was always speaking of him , she thought he forebore on her account ; therefore she took an opportunity to say to him one day : `` Prince , tell me , have you forgot the Sultan your father ?
Do n't you remember the promise you made to go and see him often ?
For my part I have not forgot what you told me at your return , and so put you in mind of it , that you may not be long before you acquit yourself of your promise . ''
So Prince Ahmed went the next morning with the same attendance as before , but much finer , and himself more magnificently mounted , equipped , and dressed , and was received by the Sultan with the same joy and satisfaction .
For several months he constantly paid his visits , always in a richer and finer equipage .
At last some viziers , the Sultan 's favorites , who judged of Prince Ahmed 's grandeur and power by the figure he cut , made the Sultan jealous of his son , saying it was to be feared he might inveigle himself into the people 's favor and dethrone him .
The Sultan of the Indies was so far from thinking that Prince Ahmed could be capable of so pernicious a design as his favorites would make him believe that he said to them : `` You are mistaken ; my son loves me , and I am certain of his tenderness and fidelity , as I have given him no reason to be disgusted . ''
But the favorites went on abusing Prince Ahmed till the Sultan said : `` Be it as it will , I do n't believe my son Ahmed is so wicked as you would persuade me he is ; how ever , I am obliged to you for your good advice , and do n't dispute but that it proceeds from your good intentions . ''
The Sultan of the Indies said this that his favorites might not know the impressions their discourse had made on his mind ; which had so alarmed him that he resolved to have Prince Ahmed watched unknown to his grand vizier .
So he sent for a female magician , who was introduced by a back door into his apartment .
`` Go immediately , '' he said , `` and follow my son , and watch him so well as to find out where he retires , and bring me word . ''
The magician left the Sultan , and , knowing the place where Prince Ahmed found his arrow , went immediately thither , and hid herself near the rocks , so that nobody could see her .
The next morning Prince Ahmed set out by daybreak , without taking leave either of the Sultan or any of his Court , according to custom .
The magician , seeing him coming , followed him with her eyes , till on a sudden she lost sight of him and his attendants .
As the rocks were very steep and craggy , they were an insurmountable barrier , so that the magician judged that there were but two things for it : either that the Prince retired into some cavern , or an abode of genies or fairies .
Thereupon she came out of the place where she was hid and went directly to the hollow way , which she traced till she came to the farther end , looking carefully about on all sides ; but , notwithstanding all her diligence , could perceive no opening , not so much as the iron gate which Prince Ahmed discovered , which was to be seen and opened to none but men , and only to such whose presence was agreeable to the Fairy Paribanou .
The magician , who saw it was in vain for her to search any farther , was obliged to be satisfied with the discovery she had made , and returned to give the Sultan an account .
The Sultan was very well pleased with the magician 's conduct , and said to her : `` Do you as you think fit ; I 'll wait patiently the event of your promises , '' and to encourage her made her a present of a diamond of great value .
As Prince Ahmed had obtained the Fairy Paribanou 's leave to go to the Sultan of the Indies ' Court once a month , he never failed , and the magician , knowing the time , went a day or two before to the foot of the rock where she lost sight of the Prince and his attendants , and waited there .
The next morning Prince Ahmed went out , as usual , at the iron gate , with the same attendants as before , and passed by the magician , whom he knew not to be such , and , seeing her lie with her head against the rock , and complaining as if she were in great pain , he pitied her , turned his horse about , went to her , and asked her what was the matter with her , and what he could do to ease her .
The artful sorceress looked at the Prince in a pitiful manner , without ever lifting up her head , and answered in broken words and sighs , as if she could hardly fetch her breath , that she was going to the capital city , but on the way thither she was taken with so violent a fever that her strength failed her , and she was forced to lie down where he saw her , far from any habitation , and without any hopes of assistance .
`` Good woman , '' replied Prince Ahmed , `` you are not so far from help as you imagine .
I am ready to assist you , and convey you where you will meet with a speedy cure ; only get up , and let one of my people take you behind him . ''
At these words the magician , who pretended sickness only to know where the Prince lived and what he did , refused not the charitable offer he made her , and that her actions might correspond with her words she made many pretended vain endeavors to get up .
At the same time two of the Prince 's attendants , alighting off their horses , helped her up , and set her behind another , and mounted their horses again , and followed the Prince , who turned back to the iron gate , which was opened by one of his retinue who rode before .
And when he came into the outward court of the Fairy , without dismounting himself , he sent to tell her he wanted to speak with her .
The Fairy Paribanou came with all imaginable haste , not knowing what made Prince Ahmed return so soon , who , not giving her time to ask him the reason , said : `` Princess , I desire you would have compassion on this good woman , '' pointing to the magician , who was held up by two of his retinue .
`` I found her in the condition you see her in , and promised her the assistance she stands in need of , and am persuaded that you , out of your own goodness , as well as upon my entreaty , will not abandon her . ''
The Fairy Paribanou , who had her eyes fixed upon the pretended sick woman all the time that the Prince was talking to her , ordered two of her women who followed her to take her from the two men that held her , and carry her into an apartment of the palace , and take as much care of her as she would herself .
While the two women executed the Fairy 's commands , she went up to Prince Ahmed , and , whispering in his ear , said : `` Prince , this woman is not so sick as she pretends to be ; and I am very much mistaken if she is not an impostor , who will be the cause of a great trouble to you .
But do n't be concerned , let what will be devised against you ; be persuaded that I will deliver you out of all the snares that shall be laid for you .
Go and pursue your journey . ''
This discourse of the Fairy 's did not in the least frighten Prince Ahmed .
`` My Princess , '' said he , `` as I do not remember I ever did or designed anybody an injury , I can not believe anybody can have a thought of doing me one , but if they have I shall not , nevertheless , forbear doing good whenever I have an opportunity . ''
Then he went back to his father 's palace .
In the meantime the two women carried the magician into a very fine apartment , richly furnished .
First they sat her down upon a sofa , with her back supported with a cushion of gold brocade , while they made a bed on the same sofa before her , the quilt of which was finely embroidered with silk , the sheets of the finest linen , and the coverlet cloth-of-gold .
When they had put her into bed -LRB- for the old sorceress pretended that her fever was so violent she could not help herself in the least -RRB- one of the women went out , and returned soon again with a china dish in her hand , full of a certain liquor , which she presented to the magician , while the other helped her to sit up .
`` Drink this liquor , '' said she ; `` it is the Water of the Fountain of Lions , and a sovereign remedy against all fevers whatsoever .
You will find the effect of it in less than an hour 's time . ''
The magician , to dissemble the better , took it after a great deal of entreaty ; but at last she took the china dish , and , holding back her head , swallowed down the liquor .
When she was laid down again the two women covered her up .
`` Lie quiet , '' said she who brought her the china cup , `` and get a little sleep if you can .
We 'll leave you , and hope to find you perfectly cured when we come again an hour hence . ''
The two women came again at the time they said they should , and found the magician up and dressed , and sitting upon the sofa .
`` Oh , admirable potion ! ''
she said : `` it has wrought its cure much sooner than you told me it would , and I shall be able to prosecute my journey . ''
The two women , who were fairies as well as their mistress , after they had told the magician how glad they were that she was cured so soon , walked before her , and conducted her through several apartments , all more noble than that wherein she lay , into a large hall , the most richly and magnificently furnished of all the palace .
Fairy Paribanou sat in this hall on a throne of massive gold , enriched with diamonds , rubies , and pearls of an extraordinary size , and attended on each hand by a great number of beautiful fairies , all richly clothed .
At the sight of so much majesty , the magician was not only dazzled , but was so amazed that , after she had prostrated herself before the throne , she could not open her lips to thank the Fairy as she proposed .
However , Paribanou saved her the trouble , and said to her : `` Good woman , I am glad I had an opportunity to oblige you , and to see you are able to pursue your journey .
I wo n't detain you , but perhaps you may not be displeased to see my palace ; follow my women , and they will show it you . ''
Then the magician went back and related to the Sultan of the Indies all that had happened , and how very rich Prince Ahmed was since his marriage with the Fairy , richer than all the kings in the world , and how there was danger that he should come and take the throne from his father .
Though the Sultan of the Indies was very well persuaded that Prince Ahmed 's natural disposition was good , yet he could not help being concerned at the discourse of the old sorceress , to whom , when she was taking her leave , he said : `` I thank thee for the pains thou hast taken , and thy wholesome advice .
I am so sensible of the great importance it is to me that I shall deliberate upon it in council . ''
Now the favorites advised that the Prince should be killed , but the magician advised differently : `` Make him give you all kinds of wonderful things , by the Fairy 's help , till she tires of him and sends him away .
As , for example , every time your Majesty goes into the field , you are obliged to be at a great expense , not only in pavilions and tents for your army , but likewise in mules and camels to carry their baggage .
Now , might not you engage him to use his interest with the Fairy to procure you a tent which might be carried in a man 's hand , and which should be so large as to shelter your whole army against bad weather ? ''
When the magician had finished her speech , the Sultan asked his favorites if they had anything better to propose ; and , finding them all silent , determined to follow the magician 's advice , as the most reasonable and most agreeable to his mild government .
Next day the Sultan did as the magician had advised him , and asked for the pavilion .
Prince Ahmed never expected that the Sultan his father would have asked such a thing , which at first appeared so difficult , not to say impossible .
Though he knew not absolutely how great the power of genies and fairies was , he doubted whether it extended so far as to compass such a tent as his father desired .
At last he replied : `` Though it is with the greatest reluctance imaginable , I will not fail to ask the favor of my wife your Majesty desires , but will not promise you to obtain it ; and if I should not have the honor to come again to pay you my respects that shall be the sign that I have not had success .
But beforehand , I desire you to forgive me , and consider that you yourself have reduced me to this extremity . ''
`` Son , '' replied the Sultan of the Indies , `` I should be very sorry if what I ask of you should cause me the displeasure of never seeing you more .
I find you do n't know the power a husband has over a wife ; and yours would show that her love to you was very indifferent if she , with the power she has of a fairy , should refuse you so trifling a request as this I desire you to ask of her for my sake . ''
The Prince went back , and was very sad for fear of offending the Fairy .
She kept pressing him to tell her what was the matter , and at last he said : `` Madam , you may have observed that hitherto I have been content with your love , and have never asked you any other favor .
Consider then , I conjure you , that it is not I , but the Sultan my father , who indiscreetly , or at least I think so , begs of you a pavilion large enough to shelter him , his Court , and army from the violence of the weather , and which a man may carry in his hand .
But remember it is the Sultan my father asks this favor . ''
`` Prince , '' replied the Fairy , smiling , `` I am sorry that so small a matter should disturb you , and make you so uneasy as you appeared to me . ''
Then the Fairy sent for her treasurer , to whom , when she came , she said : `` Nourgihan '' -- which was her name -- `` bring me the largest pavilion in my treasury . ''
Nourgiham returned presently with the pavilion , which she could not only hold in her hand , but in the palm of her hand when she shut her fingers , and presented it to her mistress , who gave it to Prince Ahmed to look at .
When Prince Ahmed saw the pavilion which the Fairy called the largest in her treasury , he fancied she had a mind to jest with him , and thereupon the marks of his surprise appeared presently in his countenance ; which Paribanou perceiving burst out laughing .
`` What !
Prince , '' cried she , `` do you think I jest with you ?
You 'll see presently that I am in earnest .
Nourgihan , '' said she to her treasurer , taking the tent out of Prince Ahmed 's hands , `` go and set it up , that the Prince may judge whether it may be large enough for the Sultan his father . ''
The treasurer went immediately with it out of the palace , and carried it a great way off ; and when she had set it up one end reached to the very palace ; at which time the Prince , thinking it small , found it large enough to shelter two greater armies than that of the Sultan his father 's , and then said to Paribanou : `` I ask my Princess a thousand pardons for my incredulity ; after what I have seen I believe there is nothing impossible to you . ''
`` You see , '' said the Fairy , `` that the pavilion is larger than what your father may have occasion for ; for you must know that it has one property -- that it is larger or smaller according to the army it is to cover . ''
The treasurer took down the tent again , and brought it to the Prince , who took it , and , without staying any longer than till the next day , mounted his horse , and went with the same attendants to the Sultan his father .
The Sultan , who was persuaded that there could not be any such thing as such a tent as he asked for , was in a great surprise at the Prince 's diligence .
He took the tent and after he had admired its smallness his amazement was so great that he could not recover himself .
When the tent was set up in the great plain , which we have before mentioned , he found it large enough to shelter an army twice as large as he could bring into the field .
But the Sultan was not yet satisfied .
`` Son , '' said he , `` I have already expressed to you how much I am obliged to you for the present of the tent you have procured me ; that I look upon it as the most valuable thing in all my treasury .
But you must do one thing more for me , which will be every whit as agreeable to me .
I am informed that the Fairy , your spouse , makes use of a certain water , called the Water of the Fountain of Lions , which cures all sorts of fevers , even the most dangerous , and , as I am perfectly well persuaded my health is dear to you , I do n't doubt but you will ask her for a bottle of that water for me , and bring it me as a sovereign medicine , which I may make use of when I have occasion .
Do me this other important piece of service , and thereby complete the duty of a good son toward a tender father . ''
The Prince returned and told the Fairy what his father had said ; `` There 's a great deal of wickedness in this demand ? ''
she answered , `` as you will understand by what I am going to tell you .
The Fountain of Lions is situated in the middle of a court of a great castle , the entrance into which is guarded by four fierce lions , two of which sleep alternately , while the other two are awake .
But do n't let that frighten you : I 'll give you means to pass by them without any danger . ''
The Fairy Paribanou was at that time very hard at work , and , as she had several clews of thread by her , she took up one , and , presenting it to Prince Ahmed , said : `` First take this clew of thread .
I 'll tell you presently the use of it .
In the second place , you must have two horses ; one you must ride yourself , and the other you must lead , which must be loaded with a sheep cut into four quarters , that must be killed to-day .
In the third place , you must be provided with a bottle , which I will give you , to bring the water in .
Set out early to-morrow morning , and when you have passed the iron gate throw the clew of thread before you , which will roll till it comes to the gates of the castle .
Follow it , and when it stops , as the gates will be open , you will see the four lions : the two that are awake will , by their roaring , wake the other two , but do n't be frightened , but throw each of them a quarter of mutton , and then clap spurs to your horse and ride to the fountain ; fill your bottle without alighting , and then return with the same expedition .
The lions will be so busy eating they will let you pass by them . ''
Prince Ahmed set out the next morning at the time appointed by the Fairy , and followed her directions exactly .
When he arrived at the gates of the castle he distributed the quarters of mutton among the four lions , and , passing through the midst of them bravely , got to the fountain , filled his bottle , and returned back as safe and sound as he went .
When he had gone a little distance from the castle gates he turned him about , and , perceiving two of the lions coming after him , he drew his sabre and prepared himself for defense .
But as he went forward he saw one of them turned out of the road at some distance , and showed by his head and tail that he did not come to do him any harm , but only to go before him , and that the other stayed behind to follow , he put his sword up again in its scabbard .
Guarded in this manner , he arrived at the capital of the Indies , but the lions never left him till they had conducted him to the gates of the Sultan 's palace ; after which they returned the same way they came , though not without frightening all that saw them , for all they went in a very gentle manner and showed no fierceness .
A great many officers came to attend the Prince while he dismounted his horse , and afterward conducted him into the Sultan 's apartment , who was at that time surrounded with his favorites .
He approached toward the throne , laid the bottle at the Sultan 's feet , and kissed the rich tapestry which covered his footstool , and then said : `` I have brought you , sir , the healthful water which your Majesty desired so much to keep among your other rarities in your treasury , but at the same time wish you such extraordinary health as never to have occasion to make use of it . ''
After the Prince had made an end of his compliment the Sultan placed him on his right hand , and then said to him : `` Son , I am very much obliged to you for this valuable present , as also for the great danger you have exposed yourself to upon my account -LRB- which I have been informed of by a magician who knows the Fountain of Lions -RRB- ; but do me the pleasure , '' continued he , `` to inform me by what address , or , rather , by what incredible power , you have been secured . ''
`` Sir , '' replied Prince Ahmed , `` I have no share in the compliment your Majesty is pleased to make me ; all the honor is due to the Fairy my spouse , whose good advice I followed . ''
Then he informed the Sultan what those directions were , and by the relation of this his expedition let him know how well he had behaved himself .
When he had done the Sultan , who showed outwardly all the demonstrations of great joy , but secretly became more jealous , retired into an inward apartment , where he sent for the magician .
The magician , at her arrival , saved the Sultan the trouble to tell her of the success of Prince Ahmed 's journey , which she had heard of before she came , and therefore was prepared with an infallible means , as she pretended .
This means she communicated to the Sultan who declared it the next day to the Prince , in the midst of all his courtiers , in these words : `` Son , '' said he , `` I have one thing more to ask of you , after which I shall expect nothing more from your obedience , nor your interest with your wife .
This request is , to bring me a man not above a foot and a half high , and whose beard is thirty feet long who carries a bar of iron upon his shoulders of five hundredweight , which he uses as a quarterstaff . ''
Prince Ahmed , who did not believe that there was such a man in the world as his father described , would gladly have excused himself ; but the Sultan persisted in his demand , and told him the Fairy could do more incredible things .
The next day the Prince returned to his dear Paribanou , to whom he told his father 's new demand , which , he said , he looked upon to be a thing more impossible than the two first ; `` for , '' added he , `` I can not imagine there can be such a man in the world ; without doubt , he has a mind to try whether or no I am so silly as to go about it , or he has a design on my ruin .
In short , how can he suppose that I should lay hold of a man so well armed , though he is but little ?
What arms can I make use of to reduce him to my will ?
If there are any means , I beg you will tell them , and let me come off with honor this time . ''
`` Do n't affright yourself , Prince , '' replied the Fairy ; `` you ran a risk in fetching the Water of the Fountain of Lions for your father , but there 's no danger in finding out this man , who is my brother Schaibar , but is so far from being like me , though we both had the same father , that he is of so violent a nature that nothing can prevent his giving cruel marks of his resentment for a slight offense ; yet , on the other hand , is so good as to oblige anyone in whatever they desire .
He is made exactly as the Sultan your father has described him , and has no other arms than a bar of iron of five hundred pounds weight , without which he never stirs , and which makes him respected .
I 'll send for him , and you shall judge of the truth of what I tell you ; but be sure to prepare yourself against being frightened at his extraordinary figure when you see him . ''
`` What !
my Queen , '' replied Prince Ahmed , `` do you say Schaibar is your brother ?
Let him be never so ugly or deformed I shall be so far from being frightened at the sight of him that , as our brother , I shall honor and love him . ''
The Fairy ordered a gold chafing-dish to be set with a fire in it under the porch of her palace , with a box of the same metal , which was a present to her , out of which taking a perfume , and throwing it into the fire , there arose a thick cloud of smoke .
Some moments after the Fairy said to Prince Ahmed : `` See , there comes my brother . ''
The Prince immediately perceived Schaibar coming gravely with his heavy bar on his shoulder , his long beard , which he held up before him , and a pair of thick mustachios , which he tucked behind his ears and almost covered his face ; his eyes were very small and deep-set in his head , which was far from being of the smallest size , and on his head he wore a grenadier 's cap ; besides all this , he was very much hump-backed .
If Prince Ahmed had not known that Schaibar was Paribanou 's brother , he would not have been able to have looked at him without fear , but , knowing first who he was , he stood by the Fairy without the least concern .
Schaibar , as he came forward , looked at the Prince earnestly enough to have chilled his blood in his veins , and asked Paribanou , when he first accosted her , who that man was .
To which she replied : `` He is my husband , brother .
His name is Ahmed ; he is son to the Sultan of the Indies .
The reason why I did not invite you to my wedding was I was unwilling to divert you from an expedition you were engaged in , and from which I heard with pleasure you returned victorious , and so took the liberty now to call for you . ''
At these words , Schaibar , looking on Prince Ahmed favorably , said : `` Is there anything else , sister , wherein I can serve him ?
It is enough for me that he is your husband to engage me to do for him whatever he desires . ''
`` The Sultan , his father , '' replied Paribanou , `` has a curiosity to see you , and I desire he may be your guide to the Sultan 's Court . ''
`` He needs but lead me the way I 'll follow him . ''
`` Brother , '' replied Paribanou , `` it is too late to go to-day , therefore stay till to-morrow morning ; and in the meantime I 'll inform you of all that has passed between the Sultan of the Indies and Prince Ahmed since our marriage . ''
The next morning , after Schaibar had been informed of the affair , he and Prince Ahmed set out for the Sultan 's Court .
When they arrived at the gates of the capital the people no sooner saw Schaibar but they ran and hid themselves ; and some shut up their shops and locked themselves up in their houses , while others , flying , communicated their fear to all they met , who stayed not to look behind them , but ran too ; insomuch that Schaibar and Prince Ahmed , as they went along , found the streets all desolate till they came to the palaces where the porters , instead of keeping the gates , ran away too , so that the Prince and Schaibar advanced without any obstacle to the council-hall , where the Sultan was seated on his throne , and giving audience .
Here likewise the ushers , at the approach of Schaibar , abandoned their posts , and gave them free admittance .
Schaibar went boldly and fiercely up to the throne , without waiting to be presented by Prince Ahmed , and accosted the Sultan of the Indies in these words : `` Thou hast asked for me , '' said he ; `` see , here I am ; what wouldst thou have with me ? ''
The Sultan , instead of answering him , clapped his hands before his eyes to avoid the sight of so terrible an object ; at which uncivil and rude reception Schaibar was so much provoked , after he had given him the trouble to come so far , that he instantly lifted up his iron bar and killed him before Prince Ahmed could intercede in his behalf .
All that he could do was to prevent his killing the grand vizier , who sat not far from him , representing to him that he had always given the Sultan his father good advice .
`` These are they , then , '' said Schaibar , `` who gave him bad , '' and as he pronounced these words he killed all the other viziers and flattering favorites of the Sultan who were Prince Ahmed 's enemies .
Every time he struck he killed some one or other , and none escaped but they who were not so frightened as to stand staring and gaping , and who saved themselves by flight .
When this terrible execution was over Schaibar came out of the council-hall into the midst of the courtyard with the iron bar upon his shoulder , and , looking hard at the grand vizier , who owed his life to Prince Ahmed , he said : `` I know here is a certain magician , who is a greater enemy of my brother-in-law than all these base favorites I have chastised .
Let the magician be brought to me presently . ''
The grand vizier immediately sent for her , and as soon as she was brought Schaibar said , at the time he fetched a stroke at her with his iron bar : `` Take the reward of thy pernicious counsel , and learn to feign sickness again . ''
After this he said : `` This is not yet enough ; I will use the whole town after the same manner if they do not immediately acknowledge Prince Ahmed , my brother-in-law , for their Sultan and the Sultan of the Indies . ''
Then all that were there present made the air echo again with the repeated acclamations of : `` Long life to Sultan Ahmed '' ; and immediately after he was proclaimed through the whole town .
Schaibar made him be clothed in the royal vestments , installed him on the throne , and after he had caused all to swear homage and fidelity to him went and fetched his sister Paribanou , whom he brought with all the pomp and grandeur imaginable , and made her to be owned Sultaness of the Indies .
As for Prince Ali and Princess Nouronnihar , as they had no hand in the conspiracy against Prince Ahmed and knew nothing of any , Prince Ahmed assigned them a considerable province , with its capital , where they spent the rest of their lives .
Afterwards he sent an officer to Prince Houssain to acquaint him with the change and make him an offer of which province he liked best ; but that Prince thought himself so happy in his solitude that he bade the officer return the Sultan his brother thanks for the kindness he designed him , assuring him of his submission ; and that the only favor he desired of him was to give him leave to live retired in the place he had made choice of for his retreat .
-LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- 1 -RRB- Arabian Nights .
THE HISTORY OF JACK THE GIANT-KILLER In the reign of the famous King Arthur there lived in Cornwall a lad named Jack , who was a boy of a bold temper , and took delight in hearing or reading of conjurers , giants , and fairies ; and used to listen eagerly to the deeds of the knights of King Arthur 's Round Table .
In those days there lived on St. Michael 's Mount , off Cornwall , a huge giant , eighteen feet high and nine feet round ; his fierce and savage looks were the terror of all who beheld him .
He dwelt in a gloomy cavern on the top of the mountain , and used to wade over to the mainland in search of prey ; when he would throw half a dozen oxen upon his back , and tie three times as many sheep and hogs round his waist , and march back to his own abode .
The giant had done this for many years when Jack resolved to destroy him .
Jack took a horn , a shovel , a pickaxe , his armor , and a dark lantern , and one winter 's evening he went to the mount .
There he dug a pit twenty-two feet deep and twenty broad .
He covered the top over so as to make it look like solid ground .
He then blew his horn so loudly that the giant awoke and came out of his den crying out : `` You saucy villain !
you shall pay for this I 'll broil you for my breakfast ! ''
He had just finished , when , taking one step further , he tumbled headlong into the pit , and Jack struck him a blow on the head with his pickaxe which killed him .
Jack then returned home to cheer his friends with the news .
Another giant , called Blunderbore , vowed to be revenged on Jack if ever he should have him in his power .
This giant kept an enchanted castle in the midst of a lonely wood ; and some time after the death of Cormoran Jack was passing through a wood , and being weary , sat down and went to sleep .
The giant , passing by and seeing Jack , carried him to his castle , where he locked him up in a large room , the floor of which was covered with the bodies , skulls and bones of men and women .
Soon after the giant went to fetch his brother who was likewise a giant , to take a meal off his flesh ; and Jack saw with terror through the bars of his prison the two giants approaching .
Jack , perceiving in one corner of the room a strong cord , took courage , and making a slip-knot at each end , he threw them over their heads , and tied it to the window-bars ; he then pulled till he had choked them .
When they were black in the face he slid down the rope and stabbed them to the heart .
Jack next took a great bunch of keys from the pocket of Blunderbore , and went into the castle again .
He made a strict search through all the rooms , and in one of them found three ladies tied up by the hair of their heads , and almost starved to death .
They told him that their husbands had been killed by the giants , who had then condemned them to be starved to death because they would not eat the flesh of their own dead husbands .
`` Ladies , '' said Jack , `` I have put an end to the monster and his wicked brother ; and I give you this castle and all the riches it contains , to make some amends for the dreadful pains you have felt . ''
He then very politely gave them the keys of the castle , and went further on his journey to Wales .
As Jack had but little money , he went on as fast as possible .
At length he came to a handsome house .
Jack knocked at the door , when there came forth a Welsh giant .
Jack said he was a traveler who had lost his way , on which the giant made him welcome , and let him into a room where there was a good bed to sleep in .
Jack took off his clothes quickly , but though he was weary he could not go to sleep .
Soon after this he heard the giant walking backward and forward in the next room , and saying to himself : `` Though here you lodge with me this night , You shall not see the morning light ; My club shall dash your brains out quite . ''
`` Say you so ? ''
thought Jack .
`` Are these your tricks upon travelers ?
But I hope to prove as cunning as you are . ''
Then , getting out of bed , he groped about the room , and at last found a large thick billet of wood .
He laid it in his own place in the bed , and then hid himself in a dark corner of the room .
The giant , about midnight , entered the apartment , and with his bludgeon struck many blows on the bed , in the very place where Jack had laid the log ; and then he went back to his own room , thinking he had broken all Jack 's bones .
Early in the morning Jack put a bold face upon the matter , and walked into the giant 's room to thank him for his lodging .
The giant started when he saw him , and began to stammer out : `` Oh !
dear me ; is it you ?
Pray how did you sleep last night ?
Did you hear or see anything in the dead of the night ? ''
`` Nothing to speak of , '' said Jack , carelessly ; `` a rat , I believe , gave me three or four slaps with its tail , and disturbed me a little ; but I soon went to sleep again . ''
The giant wondered more and more at this ; yet he did not answer a word , but went to bring two great bowls of hasty-pudding for their breakfast .
Jack wanted to make the giant believe that he could eat as much as himself , so he contrived to button a leathern bag inside his coat , and slip the hasty-pudding into this bag , while he seemed to put it into his mouth .
When breakfast was over he said to the giant : `` Now I will show you a fine trick .
I can cure all wounds with a touch ; I could cut off my head in one minute , and the next put it sound again on my shoulders .
You shall see an example . ''
He then took hold of the knife , ripped up the leathern bag , and all the hasty-pudding tumbled out upon the floor .
`` Ods splutter hur nails ! ''
cried the Welsh giant , who was ashamed to be outdone by such a little fellow as Jack , `` hur can do that hurself '' ; so he snatched up the knife , plunged it into his own stomach , and in a moment dropped down dead .
Jack , having hitherto been successful in all his undertakings , resolved not to be idle in future ; he therefore furnished himself with a horse , a cap of knowledge , a sword of sharpness , shoes of swiftness , and an invisible coat , the better to perform the wonderful enterprises that lay before him .
He traveled over high hills , and on the third day he came to a large and spacious forest through which his road lay .
Scarcely had he entered the forest when he beheld a monstrous giant dragging along by the hair of their heads a handsome knight and his lady .
Jack alighted from his horse , and tying him to an oak tree , put on his invisible coat , under which he carried his sword of sharpness .
When he came up to the giant he made several strokes at him , but could not reach his body , but wounded his thighs in several places ; and at length , putting both hands to his sword and aiming with all his might , he cut off both his legs .
Then Jack , setting his foot upon his neck , plunged his sword into the giant 's body , when the monster gave a groan and expired .
The knight and his lady thanked Jack for their deliverance , and invited him to their house , to receive a proper reward for his services .
`` No , '' said Jack , `` I can not be easy till I find out this monster 's habitation . ''
So , taking the knight 's directions , he mounted his horse and soon after came in sight of another giant , who was sitting on a block of timber waiting for his brother 's return .
Jack alighted from his horse , and , putting on his invisible coat , approached and aimed a blow at the giant 's head , but , missing his aim , he only cut off his nose .
On this the giant seized his club and laid about him most unmercifully .
`` Nay , '' said Jack , `` if this be the case I 'd better dispatch you ! ''
so , jumping upon the block , he stabbed him in the back , when he dropped down dead .
Jack then proceeded on his journey , and traveled over hills and dales , till arriving at the foot of a high mountain he knocked at the door of a lonely house , when an old man let him in .
When Jack was seated the hermit thus addressed him : `` My son , on the top of this mountain is an enchanted castle , kept by the giant Galligantus and a vile magician .
I lament the fate of a duke 's daughter , whom they seized as she was walking in her father 's garden , and brought hither transformed into a deer . ''
Jack promised that in the morning , at the risk of his life , he would break the enchantment ; and after a sound sleep he rose early , put on his invisible coat , and got ready for the attempt .
When he had climbed to the top of the mountain he saw two fiery griffins , but he passed between them without the least fear of danger , for they could not see him because of his invisible coat .
On the castle gate he found a golden trumpet , under which were written these lines : `` Whoever can this trumpet blow Shall cause the giant 's overthrow . ''
As soon as Jack had read this he seized the trumpet and blew a shrill blast , which made the gates fly open and the very castle itself tremble .
The giant and the conjurer now knew that their wicked course was at an end , and they stood biting their thumbs and shaking with fear .
Jack , with his sword of sharpness , soon killed the giant , and the magician was then carried away by a whirlwind ; and every knight and beautiful lady who had been changed into birds and beasts returned to their proper shapes .
The castle vanished away like smoke , and the head of the giant Galligantus was then sent to King Arthur .
The knights and ladies rested that night at the old man 's hermitage , and next day they set out for the Court .
Jack then went up to the King , and gave his Majesty an account of all his fierce battles .
Jack 's fame had now spread through the whole country , and at the King 's desire the duke gave him his daughter in marriage , to the joy of all his kingdom .
After this the King gave him a large estate , on which he and his lady lived the rest of their days in joy and contentment .

THE BLACK BULL OF NORROWAY And many a hunting song they sung , And song of game and glee ; Then tuned to plaintive strains their tongue , `` Of Scotland 's luve and lee . ''
To wilder measures next they turn `` The Black , Black Bull of Norroway ! ''
Sudden the tapers cease to burn , The minstrels cease to play .
`` The Cout of Keeldar , '' by J. Leyden .
In Norroway , langsyne , there lived a certain lady , and she had three dochters .
The auldest o ' them said to her mither : `` Mither , bake me a bannock , and roast me a collop , for I 'm gaun awa ' to seek my fortune . ''
Her mither did sae ; and the dochter gaed awa ' to an auld witch washerwife and telled her purpose .
The auld wife bade her stay that day , and gang and look out o ' her back door , and see what she could see .
She saw nocht the first day .
The second day she did the same , and saw nocht .
On the third day she looked again , and saw a coach-and-six coming along the road .
She ran in and telled the auld wife what she saw .
`` Aweel , '' quo ' the auld wife , `` yon 's for you . ''
Sae they took her into the coach , and galloped aff .
The second dochter next says to her mither : `` Mither , bake me a bannock , and roast me a collop , fur I 'm gaun awa ' to seek my fortune . ''
Her mither did sae ; and awa ' she gaed to the auld wife , as her sister had dune .
On the third day she looked out o ' the back door , and saw a coach-and-four coming along the road .
`` Aweel , '' quo ' the auld wife , `` yon 's for you . ''
Sae they took her in , and aff they set .
The third dochter says to her mither : `` Mither , bake me a bannock , and roast me a collop , for I 'm gaun awa ' to seek my fortune . ''
Her mither did sae ; and awa ' she gaed to the auld witch-wife .
She bade her look out o ' her back door , and see what she could see .
She did sae ; and when she came back said she saw nocht .
The second day she did the same , and saw nocht .
The third day she looked again , and on coming back said to the auld wife she saw nocht but a muckle Black Bull coming roaring alang the road .
`` Aweel , '' quo ' the auld wife , `` yon 's for you . ''
On hearing this she was next to distracted wi ' grief and terror ; but she was lifted up and set on his back , and awa ' they went .
Aye they traveled , and on they traveled , till the lady grew faint wi ' hunger .
`` Eat out o ' my right lug , '' says the Black Bull , `` and drink out o ' my left lug , and set by your leavings . ''
Sae she did as he said , and was wonderfully refreshed .
And lang they gaed , and sair they rade , till they came in sight o ' a very big and bonny castle .
`` Yonder we maun be this night , '' quo ' the bull ; `` for my auld brither lives yonder '' ; and presently they were at the place .
They lifted her aff his back , and took her in , and sent him away to a park for the night .
In the morning , when they brought the bull hame , they took the lady into a fine shining parlor , and gave her a beautiful apple , telling her no to break it till she was in the greatest strait ever mortal was in in the world , and that wad bring her o ` t. Again she was lifted on the bull 's back , and after she had ridden far , and farer than I can tell , they came in sight o ' a far bonnier castle , and far farther awa ' than the last .
Says the bull till her : `` Yonder we maun be the night , for my second brither lives yonder '' ; and they were at the place directly .
They lifted her down and took her in , and sent the bull to the field for the night .
In the morning they took the lady into a fine and rich room , and gave her the finest pear she had ever seen , bidding her no to break it till she was in the greatest strait ever mortal could be in , and that wad get her out o ` t. Again she was lifted and set on his back , and awa ' they went .
And lang they gaed , and sair they rade , till they came in sight o ' the far biggest castle , and far farthest aff , they had yet seen .
`` We maun be yonder the night , '' says the bull , `` for my young brither lives yonder '' ; and they were there directly .
They lifted her down , took her in , and sent the bull to the field for the night .
In the morning they took her into a room , the finest of a ' , and gied her a plum , telling her no to break it till she was in the greatest strait mortal could be in , and that wad get her out o ` t. Presently they brought hame the bull , set the lady on his back , and awa ' they went .
And aye they gaed , and on they rade , till they came to a dark and ugsome glen , where they stopped , and the lady lighted down .
Says the bull to her : `` Here ye maun stay till I gang and fight the deil .
Ye maun seat yoursel ' on that stane , and move neither hand nor fit till I come back , else I 'll never find ye again .
And if everything round about ye turns blue I hae beated the deil ; but should a ' things turn red he 'll hae conquered me . ''
She set hersel ' down on the stane , and by-and-by a ' round her turned blue .
O'ercome wi ' joy , she lifted the ae fit and crossed it owre the ither , sae glad was she that her companion was victorious .
The bull returned and sought for but never could find her .
Lang she sat , and aye she grat , till she wearied .
At last she rase and gaed awa ' , she kedna whaur till .
On she wandered till she came to a great hill o ' glass , that she tried a ' she could to climb , bat wasna able .
Round the bottom o ' the hill she gaed , sabbing and seeking a passage owre , till at last she came to a smith 's house ; and the smith promised , if she wad serve him seven years , he wad make her iron shoon , wherewi ' she could climb owre the glassy hill .
At seven years ' end she got her iron shoon , clamb the glassy hill , and chanced to come to the auld washerwife 's habitation .
There she was telled of a gallant young knight that had given in some bluidy sarks to wash , and whaever washed thae sarks was to be his wife .
The auld wife had washed till she was tired , and then she set to her dochter , and baith washed , and they washed , and they better washed , in hopes of getting the young knight ; but a ' they could do they couldna bring out a stain .
At length they set the stranger damosel to wark ; and whenever she began the stains came out pure and clean , but the auld wife made the knight believe it was her dochter had washed the sarks .
So the knight and the eldest dochter were to be married , and the stranger damosel was distracted at the thought of it , for she was deeply in love wi ' him .
So she bethought her of her apple , and breaking it , found it filled with gold and precious jewelry , the richest she had ever seen .
`` All these , '' she said to the eldest dochter , `` I will give you , on condition that you put off your marriage for ae day , and allow me to go into his room alone at night . ''
So the lady consented ; but meanwhile the auld wife had prepared a sleeping-drink , and given it to the knight , wha drank it , and never wakened till next morning .
The lee-lang night ther damosel sabbed and sang : `` Seven lang years I served for thee , The glassy hill I clamb for thee , The bluidy shirt I wrang for thee ; And wilt thou no wauken and turn to me ? ''
Next day she kentna what to do for grief .
She then brak the pear , and found it filled wi ' jewelry far richer than the contents o ' the apple .
Wi ' thae jewels she bargained for permission to be a second night in the young knight 's chamber ; but the auld wife gied him anither sleeping-drink , and he again sleepit till morning .
A ' night she kept sighing and singing as before : `` Seven lang years I served for thee , '' & c. Still he sleepit , and she nearly lost hope a ` thegither .
But that day when he was out at the hunting , somebody asked him what noise and moaning was yon they heard all last night in his bedchamber .
He said he heardna ony noise .
But they assured him there was sae ; and he resolved to keep waking that night to try what he could hear .
That being the third night , and the damosel being between hope and despair , she brak her plum , and it held far the richest jewelry of the three .
She bargained as before ; and the auld wife , as before , took in the sleeping-drink to the young knight 's chamber ; but he telled her he couldna drink it that night without sweetening .
And when she gaed awa ' for some honey to sweeten it wi ' , he poured out the drink , and sae made the auld wife think he had drunk it .
They a ' went to bed again , and the damosel began , as before , singing : `` Seven lang years I served for thee , The glassy hill I clamb for thee , The bluidy shirt I wrang for thee ; And wilt thou no wauken and turn to me ? ''
He heard , and turned to her .
And she telled him a ' that had befa'en her , and he telled her a ' that had happened to him .
And he caused the auld washerwife and her dochter to be burned .
And they were married , and he and she are living happy till this day , for aught I ken .

THE RED ETIN There were ance twa widows that lived on a small bit o ' ground , which they rented from a farmer .
Ane of them had twa sons , and the other had ane ; and by-and-by it was time for the wife that had twa sons to send them away to seeke their fortune .
So she told her eldest son ae day to take a can and bring her water from the well , that she might bake a cake for him ; and however much or however little water he might bring , the cake would be great or sma ' accordingly ; and that cake was to be a ' that she could gie him when he went on his travels .
The lad gaed away wi ' the can to the well , and filled it wi ' water , and then came away hame again ; but the can being broken the maist part of the water had run out before he got back .
So his cake was very sma ' ; yet sma ' as it was , his mother asked if he was willing to take the half of it with her blessing , telling him that , if he chose rather to have the hale , he would only get it wi ' her curse .
The young man , thinking he might hae to travel a far way , and not knowing when or how he might get other provisions , said he would like to hae the hale cake , com of his mother 's malison what like ; so she gave him the hale cake , and her malison alang wi ` t .
Then he took his brither aside , and gave him a knife to keep till he should come back , desiring him to look at it every morning , and as lang as it continued to be clear , then he might be sure that the owner of it was well ; but if it grew dim and rusty , then for certain some ill had befallen him .
So the young man set out to seek his fortune .
And he gaed a ' that day , and a ' the next day ; and on the third day , in the afternoon , he came up to where a shepherd was sitting with a flock o ' sheep .
And he gaed up to the shepherd and asked him wha the sheep belanged to ; and the man answered : `` The Red Etin of Ireland Ance lived in Bellygan , And stole King Malcolm 's daughter , The King of fair Scotland .
He beats her , he binds her , He lays her on a band ; And every day he dings her With a bright silver wand Like Julian the Roman He 's one that fears no man .
It 's said there 's ane predestinate To be his mortal foe ; But that man is yet unborn And lang may it be so . ''
The young man then went on his journey ; and he had not gone far when he espied an old man with white locks herding a flock of swine ; and he gaed up to him and asked whose swine these were , when the man answered : `` The Red Etin of Ireland '' -- -LRB- Repeat the verses above . -RRB-
Then the young man gaed on a bit farther , and came to another very old man herding goats ; and when he asked whose goats they were , the answer was : `` The Red Etin of Ireland '' -- -LRB- Repeat the verses again . -RRB-
This old man also told him to beware of the next beasts that he should meet , for they were of a very different kind from any he had yet seen .
So the young man went on , and by-and-by he saw a multitude of very dreadfu ' beasts , ilk ane o ' them wi ' twa heads , and on every head four horns .
And he was sore frightened , and ran away from them as fast as he could ; and glad was he when he came to a castle that stood on a hillock , wi ' the door standing wide to the wa ' .
And he gaed into the castle for shelter , and there he saw an auld wife sitting beside the kitchen fire .
He asked the wife if he might stay there for the night , as he was tired wi ' a lang journey ; and the wife said he might , but it was not a good place for him to be in , as it belanged to the Red Etin , who was a very terrible beast , wi ' three heads , that spared no living man he could get hold of .
The young man would have gone away , but he was afraid of the beasts on the outside of the castle ; so he beseeched the old woman to conceal him as well as she could , and not to tell the Etin that he was there .
He thought , if he could put over the night , he might get away in the morning without meeting wi ' the beasts , and so escape .
But he had not been long in his hidy-hole before the awful Etin came in ; and nae sooner was he in than he was heard crying : `` Snouk but and snouk ben , I find the smell of an earthly man ; Be he living , or be he dead , His heart this night shall kitchen -LRB- 1 -RRB- my bread . ''
-LRB- 1 -RRB- `` Kitchen , '' that is , `` season . ''
The monster soon found the poor young man , and pulled him from his hole .
And when he had got him out he told him that if he could answer him three questions his life should be spared .
The first was : Whether Ireland or Scotland was first inhabited ?
The second was : Whether man was made for woman , or woman for man ?
The third was : Whether men or brutes were made first ?
The lad not being able to answer one of these questions , the Red Etin took a mace and knocked him on the head , and turned him into a pillar of stone .
On the morning after this happened the younger brither took out the knife to look at it , and he was grieved to find it a ' brown wi ' rust .
He told his mother that the time was now come for him to go away upon his travels also ; so she requested him to take the can to the well for water , that she might bake a cake for him .
The can being broken , he brought hame as little water as the other had done , and the cake was as little .
She asked whether he would have the hale cake wi ' her malison , or the half wi ' her blessing ; and , like his brither , he thought it best to have the hale cake , come o ' the malison what might .
So he gaed away ; and everything happened to him that had happened to his brother !
The other widow and her son heard of a ' that had happened frae a fairy , and the young man determined that he would also go upon his travels , and see if he could do anything to relieve his twa friends .
So his mother gave him a can to go to the well and bring home water , that she might bake him a cake for his journey .
And he gaed , and as he was bringing hame the water , a raven owre abune his head cried to him to look , and he would see that the water was running out .
And he was a young man of sense , and seeing the water running out , he took some clay and patched up the holes , so that he brought home enough water to bake a large cake .
When his mother put it to him to take the half-cake wi ' her blessing , he took it in preference to having the hale wi ' her malison ; and yet the half was bigger than what the other lads had got a ` thegither .
So he gaed away on his journey ; and after he had traveled a far way he met wi ' an auld woman , that asked him if he would give her a bit of his bannock .
And he said he would gladly do that , and so he gave her a piece of the bannock ; and for that she gied him a magical wand , that she said might yet be of service to him if he took care to use it rightly .
Then the auld woman , who was a fairy , told him a great deal that whould happen to him , and what he ought to do in a ' circumstances ; and after that she vanished in an instant out o ' his sight .
He gaed on a great way farther , and then he came up to the old man herding the sheep ; and when he asked whose sheep these were , the answer was : `` The Red Etin of Ireland Ance lived in Bellygan , And stole King Malcolm 's daughter , The King of fair Scotland .
He beats her , he binds her , He lays her on a band ; And every day he dings her With a bright silver wand .
Like Julian the Roman , He 's one that fears no man , But now I fear his end is near , And destiny at hand ; And you 're to be , I plainly see , The heir of all his land . ''
-LRB- Repeat the same inquiries to the man attending the swine and the man attending the goats , with the same answer in each case . -RRB-
When he came to the place where the monstrous beasts were standing , he did not stop nor run away , but went boldly through among them .
One came up roaring with open mouth to devour him , when he struck it with his wand , and laid it in an instant dead at his feet .
He soon came to the Etin 's castle , where he knocked , and was admitted .
The auld woman that sat by the fire warned him of the terrible Etin , and what had been the fate of the twa brithers ; but he was not to be daunted .
The monster soon came in , saying : `` Snouk but and snouk ben , I find the smell of an earthly man ; Be he living , or be he dead , His heart shall be kitchen to my bread . ''
He quickly espied the young man , and bade him come forth on the floor .
And then he put the three questions to him , but the young man had been told everything by the good fairy , so he was able to answer all the questions .
When the Etin found this he knew that his power was gone .
The young man then took up the axe and hewed off the monster 's three heads .
He next asked the old woman to show him where the King 's daughters lay ; and the old woman took him upstairs and opened a great many doors , and out of every door came a beautiful lady who had been imprisoned there by the Etin ; and ane o ' the ladies was the King 's daughter .
She also took him down into a low room , and there stood two stone pillars that he had only to touch wi ' his wand , when his two friends and neighbors started into life .
And the hale o ' the prisoners were overjoyed at their deliverance , which they all acknowledged to be owing to the prudent young man .
Next day they a ' set out for the King 's Court , and a gallant company they made .
And the King married his daughter to the young man that had delivered her , and gave a noble 's daughter to ilk ane o ' the other young men ; and so they a ' lived happily a ' the rest o ' their days .
_BOOK_TITLE_ : Andrew_Lang___The_Brown_Fairy_Book.txt.out
The Brown Fairy Book What the Rose did to the Cypress -LSB- 1 -RSB- Once upon a time a great king of the East , named Saman-lalposh , -LSB- 2 -RSB- had three brave and clever sons -- Tahmasp , Qamas , and Almas-ruh-baksh .
-LSB- 3 -RSB- One day , when the king was sitting in his hall of audience , his eldest son , Prince Tahmasp , came before him , and after greeting his father with due respect , said : ' O my royal father !
I am tired of the town ; if you will give me leave , I will take my servants to-morrow and will go into the country and hunt on the hill-skirts ; and when I have taken some game I will come back , at evening-prayer time . '
His father consented , and sent with him some of his own trusted servants , and also hawks , and falcons , hunting dogs , cheetahs and leopards .
At the place where the prince intended to hunt he saw a most beautiful deer .
He ordered that it should not be killed , but trapped or captured with a noose .
The deer looked about for a place where he might escape from the ring of the beaters , and spied one unwatched close to the prince himself .
It bounded high and leaped right over his head , got out of the ring , and tore like the eastern wind into the waste .
The prince put spurs to his horse and pursued it ; and was soon lost to the sight of his followers .
Until the world-lighting sun stood above his head in the zenith he did not take his eyes off the deer ; suddenly it disappeared behind some rising ground , and with all his search he could not find any further trace of it .
He was now drenched in sweat , and he breathed with pain ; and his horse 's tongue hung from its mouth with thirst .
He dismounted and toiled on , with bridle on arm , praying and casting himself on the mercy of heaven .
Then his horse fell and surrendered its life to God .
On and on he went across the sandy waste , weeping and with burning breast , till at length a hill rose into sight .
He mustered his strength and climbed to the top , and there he found a giant tree whose foot kept firm the wrinkled earth , and whose crest touched the very heaven .
Its branches had put forth a glory of leaves , and there were grass and a spring underneath it , and flowers of many colours .
Gladdened by this sight , he dragged himself to the water 's edge , drank his fill , and returned thanks for his deliverance from thirst .
He looked about him and , to his amazement , saw close by a royal seat .
While he was pondering what could have brought this into the merciless desert , a man drew near who was dressed like a faqir , and had bare head and feet , but walked with the free carriage of a person of rank .
His face was kind , and wise and thoughtful , and he came on and spoke to the prince . '
O good youth !
how did you come here ?
Who are you ?
Where do you come from ? '
The prince told everything just as it had happened to him , and then respectfully added : ' I have made known my own circumstances to you , and now I venture to beg you to tell me your own .
Who are you ?
How did you come to make your dwelling in this wilderness ? '
To this the faqir replied : ' O youth !
it would be best for you to have nothing to do with me and to know nothing of my fortunes , for my story is fit neither for telling nor for hearing . '
The prince , however , pleaded so hard to be told , that at last there was nothing to be done but to let him hear .
` Learn and know , O young man !
that I am King Janangir -LSB- 4 -RSB- of Babylon , and that once I had army and servants , family and treasure ; untold wealth and belongings .
The Most High God gave me seven sons who grew up well versed in all princely arts .
My eldest son heard from travellers that in Turkistan , on the Chinese frontier , there is a king named Quimus , the son of Timus , and that he has an only child , a daughter named Mihr-afruz , -LSB- 5 -RSB- who , under all the azure heaven , is unrivalled for beauty .
Princes come from all quarters to ask her hand , and on one and all she imposes a condition .
She says to them : `` I know a riddle ; and I will marry anyone who answers it , and will bestow on him all my possessions .
But if a suitor can not answer my question I cut off his head and hang it on the battlements of the citadel . ''
The riddle she asks is , `` What did the rose do to the cypress ? ''
` Now , when my son heard this tale , he fell in love with that unseen girl , and he came to me lamenting and bewailing himself .
Nothing that I could say had the slightest effect on him .
I said : `` Oh my son !
if there must be fruit of this fancy of yours , I will lead forth a great army against King Quimus .
If he will give you his daughter freely , well and good ; and if not , I will ravage his kingdom and bring her away by force . ''
This plan did not please him ; he said : `` It is not right to lay a kingdom waste and to destroy a palace so that I may attain my desire .
I will go alone ; I will answer the riddle , and win her in this way . ''
At last , out of pity for him , I let him go .
He reached the city of King Quimus .
He was asked the riddle and could not give the true answer ; and his head was cut off and hung upon the battlements .
Then I mourned him in black raiment for forty days .
After this another and another of my sons were seized by the same desire , and in the end all my seven sons went , and all were killed .
In grief for their death I have abandoned my throne , and I abide here in this desert , withholding my hand from all State business and wearing myself away in sorrow . '
Prince Tahmasp listened to this tale , and then the arrow of love for that unseen girl struck his heart also .
Just at this moment of his ill-fate his people came up , and gathered round him like moths round a light .
They brought him a horse , fleet as the breeze of the dawn ; he set his willing foot in the stirrup of safety and rode off .
As the days went by the thorn of love rankled in his heart , and he became the very example of lovers , and grew faint and feeble .
At last his confidants searched his heart and lifted the veil from the face of his love , and then set the matter before his father , King Saman-lal-posh .
` Your son , Prince Tahmasp , loves distractedly the Princess Mihr-afruz , daughter of King Quimus , son of Timus . '
Then they told the king all about her and her doings .
A mist of sadness clouded the king 's mind , and he said to his son : ` If this thing is so , I will in the first place send a courier with friendly letters to King Quimus , and will ask the hand of his daughter for you .
I will send an abundance of gifts , and a string of camels laden with flashing stones and rubies of Badakhsham In this way I will bring her and her suite , and I will give her to you to be your solace .
But if King Quimus is unwilling to give her to you , I will pour a whirlwind of soldiers upon him , and I will bring to you , in this way , that most consequential of girls . '
But the prince said that this plan would not be right , and that he would go himself , and would answer the riddle .
Then the king 's wise men said : ` This is a very weighty matter ; it would be best to allow the prince to set out accompanied by some persons in whom you have confidence .
Maybe he will repent and come back . '
So King Saman ordered all preparations for the journey to be made , and then Prince Tahmasp took his leave and set out , accompanied by some of the courtiers , and taking with him a string of two-humped and raven-eyed camels laden with jewels , and gold , and costly stuffs .
By stage after stage , and after many days ' journeying , he arrived at the city of King Quimus .
What did he see ?
A towering citadel whose foot kept firm the wrinkled earth , and whose battlements touched the blue heaven .
He saw hanging from its battlements many heads , but it had not the least effect upon him that these were heads of men of rank ; he listened to no advice about laying aside his fancy , but rode up to the gate and on into the heart of the city .
The place was so splendid that the eyes of the ages have never seen its like , and there , in an open square , he found a tent of crimson satin set up , and beneath it two jewelled drums with jewelled sticks .
These drums were put there so that the suitors of the princess might announce their arrival by beating on them , after which some one would come and take them to the king 's presence .
The sight of the drums stirred the fire of Prince Tahmasp 's love .
He dismounted , and moved towards them ; but his companions hurried after and begged him first to let them go and announce him to the king , and said that then , when they had put their possessions in a place of security , they would enter into the all important matter of the princess .
The prince , however , replied that he was there for one thing only ; that his first duty was to beat the drums and announce himself as a suitor , when he would be taken , as such , to the king , who would then give him proper lodgment .
So he struck upon the drums , and at once summoned an officer who took him to King Quimus .
When the king saw how very young the prince looked , and that he was still drinking of the fountain of wonder , he said : ' O youth !
leave aside this fancy which my daughter has conceived in the pride of her beauty .
No one can answer er her riddle , and she has done to death many men who had had no pleasure in life nor tasted its charms .
God forbid that your spring also should be ravaged by the autumn winds of martyrdom . '
All his urgency , however , had no effect in making the prince withdraw .
At length it was settled between them that three days should be given to pleasant hospitality and that then should follow what had to be said and done .
Then the prince went to his own quarters and was treated as became his station .
King Quimus now sent for his daughter and for her mother , Gulrukh , -LSB- 6 -RSB- and talked to them .
He said to Mibrafruz : ` Listen to me , you cruel flirt !
Why do you persist in this folly ?
Now there has come to ask your hand a prince of the east , so handsome that the very sun grows modest before the splendour of his face ; he is rich , and he has brought gold and jewels , all for you , if you will marry him .
A better husband you will not find . '
But all the arguments of father and mother were wasted , for her only answer was : ' O my father !
I have sworn to myself that I will not marry , even if a thousand years go by , unless someone answers my riddle , and that I will give myself to that man only who does answer it . '
The three days passed ; then the riddle was asked : ` What did the rose do to the cypress ? '
The prince had an eloquent tongue , which could split a hair , and without hesitation he replied to her with a verse : ` Only the Omnipotent has knowledge of secrets ; if any man says , `` I know '' do not believe him . '
Then a servant fetched in the polluted , blue-eyed headsman , who asked : ` Whose sun of life has come near its setting ? '
took the prince by the arm , placed him upon the cloth of execution , and then , all merciless and stony hearted , cut his head from his body and hung it on the battlements .
The news of the death of Prince Tahmasp plunged his father into despair and stupefaction .
He mourned for him in black raiment for forty days ; and then , a few days later , his second son , Prince Qamas , extracted from him leave to go too ; and he , also , was put to death .
One son only now remained , the brave , eloquent , happy-natured Prince Almas-ruh-bakhsh .
One day , when his father sat brooding over his lost children , Almas came before him and said : ' O father mine !
the daughter of King Quimus has done my two brothers to death ; I wish to avenge them upon her . '
These words brought his father to tears . '
O light of your father ! '
he cried , ' I have no one left but you , and now you ask me to let you go to your death . '
` Dear father ! '
pleaded the prince , ` until I have lowered the pride of that beauty , and have set her here before you , I can not settle down or indeed sit down off my feet . '
In the end he , too , got leave to go ; but he went a without a following and alone .
Like his brothers , he made the long journey to the city of Quimus the son of Timus ; like them he saw the citadel , but he saw there the heads of Tahmasp and Qamas .
He went about in the city , saw the tent and the drums , and then went out again to a village not far off .
Here he found out a very old man who had a wife 120 years old , or rather more .
Their lives were coming to their end , but they had never beheld face of child of their own .
They were glad when the prince came to their house , and they dealt with him as with a son .
He put all his belongings into their charge , and fastened his horse in their out-house .
Then he asked them not to speak of him to anyone , and to keep his affairs secret .
He exchanged his royal dress for another , and next morning , just as the sun looked forth from its eastern oratory , he went again into the city .
He turned over in his mind without ceasing how he was to find out the meaning of the riddle , and to give them a right answer , and who could help him , and how to avenge his brothers .
He wandered about the city , but heard nothing of service , for there was no one in all that land who understood the riddle of Princess Mihr-afruz .
One day he thought he would go to her own palace and see if he could learn anything there , so he went out to her garden-house .
It was a very splendid place , with a wonderful gateway , and walls like Alexander 's ramparts .
Many gate-keepers were on guard , and there was no chance of passing them .
His heart was full of bitterness , but he said to himself : ` All will be well !
it is here I shall get what I want . '
He went round outside the garden wall hoping to find a gap , and he made supplication in the Court of Supplications and prayed , ' O Holder of the hand of the helpless !
show me my way . '
While he prayed he bethought himself that he could get into the garden with a stream of inflowing water .
He looked carefully round , fearing to be seen , stripped , slid into the stream and was carried within the great walls .
There he hid himself till his loin cloth was dry .
The garden was a very Eden , with running water amongst its lawns , with flowers and the lament of doves and the jug-jug of nightingales .
It was a place to steal the senses from the brain , and he wandered about and saw the house , but there seemed to be no one there .
In the forecourt was a royal seat of polished jasper , and in the middle of the platform was a basin of purest water that flashed like a mirror .
He pleased himself with these sights for a while , and then went back to the garden and hid himself from the gardeners and passed the night .
Next morning he put on the appearance of a madman and wandered about till he came to a lawn where several pert-faced girls were amusing themselves .
On a throne , jewelled and overspread with silken stuffs , sat a girl the splendour of whose beauty lighted up the place , and whose ambergris and attar perfumed the whole air .
` That must be Mihrafruz , ' he thought , ` she is indeed lovely . '
Just then one of the attendants came to the water 's edge to fill a cup , and though the prince was in hiding , his face was reflected in the water .
When she saw this image she was frightened , and let her cup fall into the stream , and thought , ` Is it an angel , or a peri , or a man ? '
Fear and trembling took hold of her , and she screamed as women scream .
Then some of the other girls came and took her to the princess who asked : ` What is the matter , pretty one ? ' '
O princess !
I went for water , and I saw an image , and I was afraid . '
So another girl went to the water and saw the same thing , and came back with the same story .
The princess wished to see for herself ; she rose and paced to the spot with the march of a prancing peacock .
When she saw the image she said to her nurse : ` Find out who is reflected in the water , and where he lives . '
Her words reached the prince 's ear , he lifted up his head ; she saw him and beheld beauty such as she had never seen before .
She lost a hundred hearts to him , and signed to her nurse to bring him to her presence .
The prince let himself be persuaded to go with the nurse , but when the princess questioned him as to who he was and how he had got into her garden , he behaved like a man out of his mind -- sometimes smiling , sometimes crying , and saying : ' I am hungry , ` Or words misplaced and random , civil mixed with the rude .
` What a pity ! '
said the princess , ` he is mad ! '
As she liked him she said : ` He is my madman ; let no one hurt him . '
She took him to her house and told him not to go away , for that she would provide for all his wants .
The prince thought , ` It would be excellent if here , in her very house , I could get the answer to her riddle ; but I must be silent , on pain of death . '
Now in the princess 's household there was a girl called Dil-aram -LSB- 7 -RSB- ; she it was who had first seen the image of the prince .
She came to love him very much , and she spent day and night thinking how she could make her affection known to him .
One day she escaped from the princess 's notice and went to the prince , and laid her head on his feet and said : ` Heaven has bestowed on you beauty and charm .
Tell me your secret ; who are you , and how did you come here ?
I love you very much , and if you would like to leave this place I will go with you .
I have wealth equal to the treasure of the miserly Qarun . '
But the prince only made answer like a man distraught , and told her nothing .
He said to himself , ` God forbid that the veil should be taken in vain from my secret ; that would indeed disgrace me . '
So , with streaming eyes and burning breast , Dil-aram arose and went to her house and lamented and fretted .
Now whenever the princess commanded the prince 's attendance , Dil-aram , of all the girls , paid him attention and waited on him best .
The princess noticed this , and said : ' O Dil-aram !
you must take my madman into your charge and give him whatever he wants . '
This was the very thing Dilaram had prayed for .
A little later she took the prince into a private place and she made him take an oath of secrecy , and she herself took one and swore , ` By Heaven !
I will not tell your secret .
Tell me all about yourself so that I may help you to get what you want . '
The prince now recognised in her words the perfume of true love , and he made compact with her . '
O lovely girl !
I want to know what the rose did to the cypress .
Your mistress cuts off men 's heads because of this riddle ; what is at the bottom of it , and why does she do it ? '
Then Dil-aram answered : ` If you will promise to marry me and to keep me always amongst those you favour , I will tell you all I know , and I will keep watch about the riddle . ' '
O lovely girl , ' rejoined he , ` if I accomplish my purpose , so that I need no longer strive for it , I will keep my compact with you .
When I have this woman in my power and have avenged my brothers , I will make you my solace . ' '
O wealth of my life and source of my joy ! '
responded Dil-aram , ' I do not know what the rose did to the cypress ; but so much I know that the person who told Mihr-afruz about it is a negro whom she hides under her throne .
He fled here from Waq of the Caucasus -- it is there you must make inquiry ; there is no other way of getting at the truth .
` On hearing these words , the prince said to his heart , ' O my heart !
your task will yet wear away much of your life . '
He fell into long and far thought , and Dil-aram looked at him and said : ' O my life and my soul !
do not be sad .
If you would like this woman killed , I will put poison into her cup so that she will never lift her head from her drugged sleep again . ' '
O Dil-aram !
such a vengeance is not manly .
I shall not rest till I have gone to Waq of the Caucasus and have cleared up the matter . '
Then they repeated the agreement about their marriage , and bade one another goodbye .
The prince now went back to the village , and told the old man that he was setting out on a long journey , and begged him not to be anxious , and to keep safe the goods which had been entrusted to him .
The prince had not the least knowledge of the way to Waq of the Caucasus , and was cast down by the sense of his helplessness .
He was walking along by his horse 's side when there appeared before him an old man of serene countenance , dressed in green and carrying a staff , who resembled Khizr .
-LSB- 8 -RSB- The prince thanked heaven , laid the hands of reverence on his breast and salaamed .
The old man returned the greeting graciously , and asked : ` How fare you ?
Whither are you bound ?
You look like a traveller . ' '
O revered saint !
I am in this difficulty : I do not know the way to Waq of the Caucasus . '
The old man of good counsel looked at the young prince and said : ` Turn back from this dangerous undertaking .
Do not go ; choose some other task !
If you had a hundred lives you would not bring one out safe from this journey . '
But his words had no effect on the prince 's resolve .
` What object have you , ' the old man asked , ` in thus consuming your life ? ' '
I have an important piece of business to do , and only this journey makes it possible .
I must go ; I pray you , ill God 's name , tell me the way . '
When the saint saw that the prince was not to be moved , he said : ` Learn and know , O youth !
that Waq of Qaf is in the Caucasus and is a dependency of it .
In it there are jins , demons , and peris .
You must go on along this road till it forks into three ; take neither the right hand nor the left , but the middle path .
Follow this for a day and a night .
Then you will come to a column on which is a marble slab inscribed with Cufic characters .
Do what is written there ; beware of disobedience . '
Then he gave his good wishes for the journey and his blessing , and the prince kissed his feet , said good-bye , and , with thanks to the Causer of Causes , took the road .
After a day and a night he saw the column rise in silent beauty to the heavens .
Everything was as the wise old man had said it would be , and the prince , who was skilled in all tongues , read the following Cufic inscription : ' O travellers !
be it known to you that this column has been set up with its tablet to give true directions about these roads .
If a man would pass his life in ease and pleasantness , let him take the right-hand path .
If he take the left , he will have some trouble , but he will reach his goal without much delay .
Woe to him who chooses the middle path !
if he had a thousand lives he would not save one ; it is very hazardous ; it leads to the Caucasus , and is an endless road .
Beware of it ! '
The prince read and bared his head and lifted his hands in supplication to Him who has no needs , and prayed , ' O Friend of the traveller !
I , Thy servant , come to Thee for succour .
My purpose lies in the land of Qaf and my road is full of peril .
Lead me by it . '
Then he took a handful of earth and cast it on his collar , and said : ' O earth !
be thou my grave ; and O vest !
tee thou my winding-sheet ! '
Then he took the middle road and went along it , day after day , with many a silent prayer , till he saw trees rise from the weary waste of sand .
They grew in a garden , and he went up to the gate and found it a slab of beautifully worked marble , and that near it there lay sleeping , with his head on a stone , a negro whose face was so black that it made darkness round him .
His upper lip , arched like an eyebrow , curved upwards to his nostrils and his lower hung down like a camel 's .
Four millstones formed his shield , and on a box-tree close by hung his giant sword .
His loin-cloth was fashioned of twelve skins of beasts , and was bound round his waist by a chain of which each link was as big as an elephant 's thigh .
The prince approached and tied up his horse near the negro 's head .
Then he let fall the Bismillah from his lips , entered the garden and walked through it till he came to the private part , delighting in the great trees , the lovely verdure , and the flowery borders .
In the inner garden there were very many deer .
These signed to him with eye and foot to go back , for that this was enchanted ground ; but he did not understand them , and thought their pretty gestures were a welcome .
After a while he reached a palace which had a porch more splendid than Caesar 's , and was built of gold and silver bricks .
In its midst was a high seat , overlaid with fine carpets , and into it opened eight doors , each having opposite to it a marble basin .
Banishing care , Prince Almas walked on through the garden , when suddenly a window opened and a girl , who was lovely enough to make the moon writhe with jealousy , put out her head .
She lost her heart to the good looks of the prince , and sent her nurse to fetch him so that she might learn where he came from and how he had got into her private garden where even lions and wolves did not venture .
The nurse went , and was struck with amazement at the sun-like radiance of his face ; she salaamed and said : ' O youth !
welcome !
the lady of the garden calls you ; come ! '
He went with her and into a palace which was like a house in Paradise , and saw seated on the royal carpets of the throne a girl whose brilliance shamed the shining sun .
He salaamed ; she rose , took him by the hand and placed him near her . '
O young man !
who are you ?
Where do you come from ?
How did you get into this garden ? '
He told her his story from beginning to end , and Lady Latifa -LSB- 9 -RSB- replied : ` This is folly !
It will make you a vagabond of the earth , and lead you to destruction .
Come , cease such talk !
No one can go to the Caucasus .
Stay with me and be thankful , for here is a throne which you can share with me , and in my society you can enjoy my wealth .
I will do whatever you wish ; I will bring here King Qulmus and his daughter , and you can deal with them as you will . ' '
O Lady Latifa , ' he said , ' I have made a compact with heaven not to sit down off my feet till I have been to Waq of Qaf and have cleared up this matter , and have taken Mihrafruz from her father , as brave men take , and have put her in prison .
When I have done all this I will come back to you in state and with a great following , and I will marry you according to the law . '
Lady Latifa argued and urged her wishes , but in vain ; the prince was not to be moved .
Then she called to the cupbearers for new wine , for she thought that when his head was hot with it he might consent to stay .
The pure , clear wine was brought ; she filled a cup and gave to him .
He said : ' O most enchanting sweetheart !
it is the rule for the host to drink first and then the guest . '
So to make him lose his head , she drained the cup ; then filled it again and gave him .
He drank it off , and she took a lute from one of the singers and played upon it with skill which witched away the sense of all who heard .
But it was all in vain ; three days passed in such festivities , and on the fourth the prince said : ' O joy of my eyes !
I beg now that you will bid me farewell , for my way is long and the fire of your love darts flame into the harvest of my heart .
By heaven 's grace I may accomplish my purpose , and , if so , I will come back to you . '
Now she saw that she could not in any way change his resolve , she told her nurse to bring a certain casket which contained , she said , something exhilarating which would help the prince on his journey .
The box was brought , and she divided off a portion of what was within and gave it to the prince to eat .
Then , and while he was all unaware , she put forth her hand to a stick fashioned like a snake ; she said some words over it and struck him so sharply on the shoulder that he cried out ; then he made a pirouette and found that he was a deer .
When he knew what had been done to him he thought , ` All the threads of affliction are gathered together ; I have lost my last chance ! '
He tried to escape , but the magician sent for her goldsmith , who , coming , overlaid the deer-horns with gold and jewels .
The kerchief which that day she had had in her hand was then tied round its neck , and this freed it from her attentions .
The prince-deer now bounded into the garden and at once sought some way of escape .
It found none , and it joined the other deer , which soon made it their leader .
Now , although the prince had been transformed into the form of a deer , he kept his man 's heart and mind .
He said to himself , ` Thank heaven that the Lady Latifa has changed me into this shape , for at least deer are beautiful . '
He remained for some time living as a deer amongst the rest , but at length resolved that an end to such a life must be put ill some way .
He looked again for some place by which he could get out of the magic garden .
Following round the wall he reached a lower part ; he remembered the Divine Names and flung himself over , saying , ` Whatever happens is by the will of God . '
When he looked about he found that he was in the very same place he had jumped from ; there was the palace , there the garden and the deer !
Eight times he leaped over the wall and eight times found himself where he had started from ; but after the ninth leap there was a change , there was a palace and there was a garden , but the deer were gone .
Presently a girl of such moon-like beauty opened a window that the prince lost to her a hundred hearts .
She was delighted with the beautiful deer , and cried to her nurse : ` Catch it !
if you will I will give you this necklace , every pearl of which is worth a kingdom . '
The nurse coveted the pearls , but as she was three hundred years old she did not know how she could catch a deer .
However , she went down into the garden and held out some grass , but when she went near the creature ran away .
The girl watched with great excitement from the palace window , and called : ' O nurse , if you do n't catch it , I will kill you ! ' '
I am killing myself , ' shouted back the old woman .
The girl saw that nurse tottering along and went down to help , marching with the gait of a prancing peacock .
When she saw the gilded horns and the kerchief she said : ` It must be accustomed to the hand , and be some royal pet ! '
The prince had it in mind that this might be another magician who could give him some other shape , but still it seemed best to allow himself to be caught .
So he played about the girl and let her catch him by the neck .
A leash was brought , fruits were given , and it was caressed with delight .
It was taken to the palace and tied at the foot of the Lady Jamila 's raised seat , but she ordered a longer cord to be brought so that it might be able to jump up beside her .
When the nurse went to fix the cord she saw tears falling from its eyes , and that it was dejected and sorrowful ' O Lady Jamila !
this is a wonderful deer , it is crying ; I never saw a deer cry before . '
Jamila darted down like a flash of lightning , and saw that it was so .
It rubbed its head on her feet and then shook it so sadly that the girl cried for sympathy .
She patted it and said : ` Why are you sad , my heart ?
Why do you cry , my soul ?
Is it because I have caught you ?
I love you better than my own life . '
But , spite of her comforting , it cried the more .
Then Jamila said : ` Unless I am mistaken , this is the work of my wicked sister Latifa , who by magic art turns servants of God into beasts of the field . '
At these words the deer uttered sounds , and laid its head on her feet .
Then Jamila was sure it was a man , and said : ` Be comforted , I will restore you to your own shape . '
She bathed herself and ordered the deer to be bathed , put on clean raiment , called for a box which stood in an alcove , opened it and gave a portion of what was in it to the deer to eat .
Then she slipped her hand under her carpet and produced a stick to which she said something .
She struck the deer hard , it pirouetted and became Prince Almas .
The broidered kerchief and the jewels lay upon the ground .
The prince prostrated himself in thanks to heaven and Jamila , and said : ' O delicious person !
O Chinese Venus !
how shall I excuse myself for giving you so much trouble ?
With what words can I thank you ? '
Then she called for a clothes-wallet and chose out a royal dress of honour .
Her attendants dressed him in it , and brought him again before the tender-hearted lady .
She turned to him a hundred hearts , took his hand and seated him beside her , and said : ' O youth !
tell me truly who you are and where you come from , and how you fell into the power of my sister . '
Even when he was a deer the prince had much admired Jamila now he thought her a thousand times more lovely than before .
He judged that in truth alone was safety , and so told her his whole story .
Then she asked : ' O Prince Almas-ruh-bakhsh , do you still wish so much to make this journey to Waq of Qaf ?
What hope is there in it ?
The road is dangerous even near here , and this is not yet the borderland of the Caucasus .
Come , give it up !
It is a great risk , and to go is not wise .
It would be a pity for a man like you to fall into the hands of jins and demons .
Stay with me , and I will do whatever you wish . ' '
O most delicious person ! '
he answered , ` you are very generous , and the choice of my life lies in truth in your hands ; but I beg one favour of you .
If you love me , so do I too love you .
If you really love me , do not forbid me to make this journey , but help me as far as you can .
Then it may be that I shall succeed , and if I return with my purpose fulfilled I will marry you according to the law , and take you to my own country , and we will spend the rest of our lives together in pleasure and good companionship .
Help me , if you can , and give me your counsel . ' '
O very stuff of my life , ' replied Jamila ' I will give you things that are not in kings ' treasuries , and which will be of the greatest use to you .
First , there are the bow and arrows of his Reverence the Prophet Salih .
Secondly , there is the Scorpion of Solomon -LRB- on whom be peace -RRB- , which is a sword such as no king has ; steel and stone are one to it ; if you bring it down on a rock it will not be injured , and it will cleave whatever you strike .
Thirdly , there is the dagger which the sage Timus himself made ; this is most useful , and the man who wears it would not bend under seven camels ' loads .
What you have to do first is to get to the home of the Simurgh , -LSB- 10 -RSB- and to make friends with him .
If he favours you , he will take you to Waq of Qaf ; if not , you will never get there , for seven seas are on the way , and they are such seas that if all the kings of the earth , and all their wazirs , and all their wise men considered for a thousand years , they would not be able to cross them . ' '
O most delicious person !
where is the Simurgh 's home ?
How shall I get there ? ' '
O new fruit of life !
you must just do what I tell you , and you must use your eyes and your brains , for if you do n't you will find yourself at the place of the negroes , who are a bloodthirsty set ; and God forbid they should lay hands on your precious person . '
Then she took the bow and quiver of arrows , the sword , and the dagger out of a box , and the prince let fall a Bismillah , and girt them all on .
Then Jamila of the houri-face , produced two saddle-bags of ruby-red silk , one filled with roasted fowl and little cakes , and the other with stones of price .
Next she gave him a horse as swift as the breeze of the morning , and she said : ` Accept all these things from me ; ride till you come to a rising ground , at no great distance from here , where there is a spring .
It is called the Place of Gifts , and you must stay there one night .
There you will see many wild beasts -- lions , tigers , leopards , apes , and so on .
Before you get there you must capture some game .
On the long road beyond there dwells a lion-king , alla if other beasts did not fear him they would ravage the whole country and let no one pass .
The lion is a red transgressor , so when he comes rise and do him reverence ; take a cloth and rub the dust and earth from his face , then set the game you have taken before him , well cleansed , and lay the hands of respect on your breast .
When he wishes to eat , take your knife and cut pieces of the meat and set them before him with a bow .
In this way you will enfold that lion-king in perfect friendship , and he will be most useful to you , and you will be safe from molestation by the negroes .
When you go on from the Place of Gifts , be sure you do not take the right-hand road ; take the left , for the other leads by the negro castle , which is known as the Place of Clashing Swords , and where there are forty negro captains each over three thousand or four thousand more .
Their chief is Taramtaq .
-LSB- 11 -RSB- Further on than this is the home of the Simurgh . '
Having stored these things in the prince 's memory , she said : ` You will see everything happen just as I have said . '
Then she escorted him a little way ; they parted , and she went home to mourn his absence .
Prince Almas , relying on the Causer of Causes , rode on to the Place of Gifts and dismounted at the platform .
Everything happened just as Jamila had foretold ; when one or two watches of the night had passed , he saw that the open ground around him was full of such stately and splendid animals as he had never seen before .
By-and-by , they made way for a wonderfully big lion , which was eighty yards from nose to tail-tip , and was a magnificent creature .
The prince advanced and saluted it ; it proudly drooped its head and forelocks and paced to the platform .
Seventy or eighty others were with it , and now encircled it at a little distance .
It laid its right paw over its left , and the prince took the kerchief Jamila had given him for the purpose , and rubbed the dust and earth from its face ; then brought forward the game he had prepared , and crossing his hands respectfully on his breast stood waiting before it .
When it wished for food he cut off pieces of the meat and put them in its mouth .
The serving lions also came near and the prince would have stayed his hand , but the king-lion signed to him to feed them too .
This he did , laying the meat on the platform .
Then the king-lion beckoned the prince to come near and said : ` Sleep at ease ; my guards will watch . '
.
So , surrounded by the lion-guard , he slept till dawn , when the king lion said good-bye , and gave him a few of his own hairs and said : ` When you are in any difficulty , burn one of these and I will be there . '
Then it went off into the jungle .
Prince Almas immediately started ; he rode till he came to the parting of the ways .
He remembered quite well that the right-hand way was short and dangerous , but he bethought himself too that whatever was written on his forehead would happen , and took the forbidden road .
By-and-by he saw a castle , and knew from what Jamila had told him that it was the Place of Clashing Swords .
He would have liked to go back by the way ho had come , but courage forbade , and he said , ` What has been preordained from eternity will happen to me , ' and went on towards the castle .
He was thinking of tying his horse to a tree which grew near the gate when a negro came out and spied him .
` Ha ! '
said the wretch to himself , ` this is good ; Taram-taq has not eaten man-meat for a long time , and is craving for some .
I will take this creature to him . '
He took hold of the prince 's reins , and said : ` Dismount , man-child !
Come to my master .
He has wanted to eat man-meat this long time back . '
` What nonsense are you saying ? '
said the prince , and other such words .
When the negro understood that he was being abused , he cried : ` Come along !
I will put you into such a state that the birds of the air will weep for you . '
Then the prince drew the Scorpion of Solomon and struck him -- struck him on the leathern belt and shore him through so that the sword came out on the other side .
He stood upright for a little while , muttered some words , put out his hand to seize the prince , then fell in two and surrendered his life .
There was water close at hand , and the prince made his ablution , and then said : ' O my heart !
a wonderful task lies upon you . '
A second negro came out of the fort , and seeing what had been done , went back and told his chief .
Others wished to be doubled , and went out , and of every one the Scorpion of Solomon made two .
Then Taram-taq sent for a giant negro named Chil-maq , who in the day of battle was worth three hundred , and said to him : ' I shall thank you to fetch me that man . '
Chil-maq went out , tall as a tower , and bearing a shield of eight millstones , and as he walked he shouted : ` Ho !
blunder-head !
by what right do you come to our country and kill our people ?
Come !
make two of me . '
As the prince was despicable in his eyes , he tossed aside his club and rushed to grip him with his hands .
He caught him by the collar , tucked him under his arm and set off with him to Taram-taq .
But the prince drew the dagger of Timus and thrust it upwards through the giant 's armpit , for its full length .
This made Chil-maq drop him and try to pick up his club ; but when he stooped the mighty sword shore him through at the waist .
When news of his champion 's death reached Taram-taq he put himself at the head of an army of his negroes and led them forth .
Many fell before the magic sword , and the prince laboured on in spite of weakness and fatigue till he was almost worn out .
In a moment of respite from attack he struck his fire-steel and burned a hair of the king-lion ; and he had just succeeded in this when the negroes charged again and all but took him prisoner .
Suddenly from behind the distant veil of the desert appeared an army of lions led by their king .
` What brings these scourges of heaven here ? '
cried the negroes .
They came roaring up , and put fresh life into the prince .
He fought on , and when he struck on a belt the wearer fell in two , and when on a head he cleft to the waist .
Then the ten thousand mighty lions joined the fray and tore in pieces man and horse .
Taram-taq was left alone ; he would have retired into his fort , but the prince shouted : ` Whither away , accursed one ?
Are you fleeing before me ? '
At these defiant words the chief shouted back , ` Welcome , man !
Come here and I will soften you to wax beneath my club . '
Then he hurled his club at the prince 's head , but it fell harmless because the prince had quickly spurred his horse forward .
The chief , believing he had hit him , was looking down for him , when all at once he came up behind and cleft him to the waist and sent him straight to hell .
The king-lion greatly praised the dashing courage of Prince Almas .
They went together into the Castle of Clashing Swords and found it adorned and fitted in princely fashion .
In it was a daughter of Taram taq , still a child She sent a message to Prince Almas saying , ' O king of the world !
choose this slave to be your handmaid .
Keep her with you ; where you go , there she will go ! '
He sent for her and she kissed his feet and received the Mussulman faith at his hands .
He told her he was going a long journey on important business , and that when he came back he would take her and her possessions to his own country , but that for the present she must stay in the castle .
Then he made over the fort and all that was in it to the care of the lion , saying : ` Guard them , brother !
let no one lay a hand on them . '
He said goodbye , chose a fresh horse from the chief 's stable and once again took the road .
After travelling many stages and for many days , he reached a plain of marvellous beauty and refreshment .
It was carpeted with flowers -- roses , tulips , and clover ; it had lovely lawns , and amongst them running water .
This choicest place of earth filled him with wonder .
There was a tree such as he had never seen before ; its branches were alike , but it bore flowers and fruit of a thousand kinds .
Near it a reservoir had been fashioned of four sorts of stone -- touchstone , pure stone , marble , and loadstone .
In and out of it flowed water like attar .
The prince felt sure this must be the place of the Simurgh . '
he dismounted , turned his horse loose to graze , ate some of the food Jamila had given him , drank of the stream and lay down to sleep .
He was still dozing when he was aroused by the neighing and pawing of his horse .
When he could see clearly he made out a mountain-like dragon whose heavy breast crushed the stones beneath it into putty .
He remembered the Thousand Names of God and took the bow of Salih from its case and three arrows from their quiver .
He bound the dagger of Timus firmly to his waist and hung the scorpion of Solomon round his neck .
Then he set an arrow on the string and released it with such force that it went in at the monster 's eye right up to the notch .
The dragon writhed on itself , and belched forth an evil vapour , and beat the ground with its head till the earth quaked .
Then the prince took a second arrow and shot into its throat .
It drew in its breath and would have sucked the prince into its maw , but when he was within striking distance he drew his sword and , having committed himself to God , struck a mighty blow which cut the creature 's neck down to the gullet .
The foul vapour of the beast and horror at its strangeness now overcame the prince , and he fainted .
When he came to himself he found that he was drenched in the gore of the dead monster .
He rose and thanked God for his deliverance .
The nest of the Simurgh was in the wonderful tree above him , and in it were young birds ; the parents were away searching for food .
They always told the children , before they left them , not to put their heads out of the nest ; but , to-day , at the noise of the fight below , they looked down and so saw the whole affair .
By the time the dragon had been killed they were very hungry and set up a clamour for food .
The prince therefore cut up the dragon and fed them with it , bit by bit , till they had eaten the whole .
He then washed himself and lay down to rest , and he was still asleep when the Simurgh came home .
As a rule , the young birds raised a clamour of welcome when their parents came near , but on this day they were so full of dragon-meat that they had no choice , they had to go to sleep .
As they flew nearer , the old birds saw the prince lying under the tree and no sign of life in the nest .
They thought that the misfortune which for so many earlier years had befallen them had again happened and that their nestlings had disappeared .
They had never been able to find out the murderer , and now suspected the prince .
` He has eaten our children and sleeps after it ; he must die , ' said the father-bird , and flew back to the hills and clawed up a huge stone which he meant to let fall on the prince 's head .
But his mate said , ` Let us look into the nest first for to kill an innocent person would condemn us at the Day of Resurrection . '
They flew nearer , and presently the young birds woke and cried , ` Mother , what have you brought for us ? '
and they told the whole story of the fight , and of how they were alive only by the favour of the young man under the tree , and of his cutting up the dragon and of their eating it .
The mother-bird then remarked , ` Truly , father !
you were about to do a strange thing , and a terrible sin has been averted from you . '
Then the Simurgh flew off to a distance with the great stone and dropped it .
It sank down to the very middle of the earth .
Coming back , the Simurgh saw that a little sunshine fell upon the prince through the leaves , and it spread its wings and shaded him till he woke .
When he got up he salaamed to it , who returned his greeting with joy and gratitude , and caressed him and said : ' O youth , tell me true !
who are you , and where are you going ?
And how did you cross that pitiless desert where never yet foot of man had trod ? '
The prince told his story from beginning to end , and finished by saying : ` Now it is my heart 's wish that you should help me to get to Waq of the Caucasus .
Perhaps , by your favour , I shall accomplish my task and avenge my brothers . '
In reply the Simurgh . '
first blessed the deliverer of his children , and then went on : ` What you have done no child of man has ever done before ; you assuredly have a claim on all my help , for every year up till now that dragon has come here and has destroyed my nestlings , and I have never been able to find who was the murderer and to avenge myself .
By God 's grace you have removed my children 's powerful foe .
I regard you as a child of my own .
Stay with me ; I will give you everything you desire , and I will establish a city here for you , and will furnish it with every requisite ; I will give you the land of the Caucasus , and will make its princes subject to you .
Give up the journey to Waq , it is full of risk , and the jins there will certainly kill you . '
But nothing could move the prince , and seeing this the bird went on : ` Well , so be it !
When you wish to set forth you must go into the plain and take seven head of deer , and must make water-tight bags of their hides and keep their flesh in seven portions .
Seven seas lie on our way -- I will carry you over them ; but if I have not food and drink we shall fall into the sea and be drowned .
When I ask for it you must put food and water into my mouth .
So we shall make the journey safely . '
The prince did all as he was told , then they took flight ; they crossed the seven seas , and at each one the prince fed the Simurgh When they alighted on the shore of the last sea , it said : ' O my son !
there lies your road ; follow it to the city .
Take thee three feathers of mine , and , if you are in a difficulty , burn one and I will be with you in the twinkling of an eye . '
The prince walked on in solitude till he reached the city .
He went in and wandered about through all quarters , and through bazaars and lanes and squares , in the least knowing from whom he could ask information about the riddle of Mihr-afruz .
He spent seven days thinking it over in silence .
From the first day of his coming he had made friends with a young cloth-merchant , and a great liking had sprung up between them .
One day he said abruptly to his companion : ' O dear friend !
I wish you would tell me what the rose did to the cypress , and what the sense of the riddle is . '
The merchant started , and exclaimed : ` If there were not brotherly affection between us , I would cut off your head for asking me this ! '
` If you meant to kill me , ' retorted the prince , ` you would still have first to tell me what I want to know . '
When the merchant saw that the prince was in deadly earnest , he said : ` If you wish to hear the truth of the matter you must wait upon our king .
There is no other way ; no one else will tell you .
I have a well-wisher at the Court , named Farrukh-fal , -LSB- 12 -RSB- and will introduce you to him . '
` That would be excellent , ' cried the prince .
A meeting was arranged between Farrukhfal and Almas , and then the amir took him to the king 's presence and introduced him as a stranger and traveller who had come from afar to sit in the shadow of King Sinaubar .
Now the Simurgh had given the prince a diamond weighing thirty misqals , and he ordered this to the king , who at once recognised its value , and asked where it had been obtained .
` I , your slave , once had riches and state and power ; there are many such stones in my country .
On my way here I was plundered at the Castle of Clashing Swords , and I saved this one thing only , hidden in my bathing-cloth . '
In return for the diamond , King Sinaubar showered gifts of much greater value , for he remembered that it was the last possession of the prince .
He showed the utmost kindness and hospitality , and gave his wazir orders to instal the prince in the royal guest-house .
He took much pleasure in his visitor 's society ; they were together every day and spent the time most pleasantly .
Several times the king said : ` Ask me for something , that I may give it you .
` One day he so pressed to know what would pleasure the prince , that the latter said : ' I have only one wish , and that I will name to you in private . '
The king at once commanded every one to withdraw , and then Prince Almas said : ` The desire of my life is to know what the rose did to the cypress , and what meaning there is in the words . '
The king was astounded .
` In God 's name !
if anyone else had said that to me I should have cut off his head instantly . '
The prince heard this in silence , and presently so beguiled the king with pleasant talk that to kill him was impossible .
Time flew by , the king again and again begged the prince to ask some gift of him , and always received this same reply : ' I wish for your Majesty 's welfare , what more can I desire ?
` One night there was a banquet , and cupbearers carried round gold and silver cups of sparkling wine , and singers with sweetest voices contended for the prize .
The prince drank from the king 's own cup , and when his head was hot with wine he took a lute from one of the musicians and placed himself on the carpet border and sang and sang till he witched away the sense of all who listened .
Applause and compliments rang from every side .
The king filled his cup and called the prince and gave it him and said : ` Name your wish !
it is yours . '
The prince drained off the wine and answered : ' O king of the world !
learn and know that I have only one aim in life , and this is to know what the rose did to the cypress . '
` Never yet , ' replied the king , ` has any man come out from that question alive .
If this is your only wish , so be it ; I will tell you .
But I will do this on one condition only , namely , that when you have heard you will submit yourself to death . '
To this the prince agreed , and said : ' I set my foot firmly on this compact . '
The king then gave an order to an attendant ; a costly carpet overlaid with European velvet was placed near him , and a dog was led in by a golden and jewelled chain and set upon the splendid stuffs .
A band of fair girls came in and stood round it in waiting .
Then , with ill words , twelve negroes dragged in a lovely woman , fettered on hands and feet and meanly dressed , and they set her down on the bare floor .
She was extraordinarily beautiful , and shamed the glorious sun .
The king ordered a hundred stripes to be laid on her tender body ; she sighed a long sigh .
Food was called for and table-cloths were spread .
Delicate meats were set before the dog , and water given it in a royal cup of Chinese crystal .
When it had eaten its fill , its leavings were placed before the lovely woman and she was made to eat of them .
She wept and her tears were pearls ; she smiled and her lips shed roses .
Pearls and flowers were gathered up and taken to the treasury .
` Now , ' said the king , ` you have seen these things and your purpose is fulfilled . '
` Truly , ' said the prince , ' I have seen things which I have not understood ; what do they mean , and what is the story of them ?
Tell me and kill me . '
Then said the king : ` The woman you see there in chains is my wife ; she is called Gul , the Rose , and I am Sinaubar , the Cypress .
One day I was hunting and became very thirsty .
After great search I discovered a well in a place so secret that neither bird nor beast nor man could find it without labour .
I was alone , I took my turban for a rope and my cap for a bucket .
There was a good deal of water , but when I let down my rope , something caught it , and I could not in any way draw it back .
I shouted down into the well : `` O !
servant of God !
whoever you are , why do you deal unfairly with me ?
I am dying of thirst , let go !
in God 's name . ''
A cry came up in answer , `` O servant of God !
we have been in the well a long time ; in God 's name get us out ! ''
After trying a thousand schemes , I drew up two blind women .
They said they were peris , and that their king had blinded them in his anger and had left them in the well alone . '
`` Now , '' they said , `` if you will get us the cure for our blindness we will devote ourselves to your service , and will do whatever you wish . '' '
`` What is the cure for your blindness ? '' '
`` Not far from this place , '' they said , `` a cow comes up from the great sea to graze ; a little of her dung would cure us .
We should be eternally your debtors .
Do not let the cow see you , or she will assuredly kill you . ''
` With renewed strength and spirit I went to the shore .
There I watched the cow come up from the sea , graze , and go back .
Then I came out of my hiding , took a little of her dung and conveyed it to the peris .
They rubbed it on their eyes , and by the Divine might saw again .
` They thanked heaven and me , and then considered what they could do to show their gratitude to me .
`` Our peri-king , '' they said , `` has a daughter whom he keeps under his own eye and thinks the most lovely girl on earth .
In good sooth , she has not her equal !
Now we will get you into her house and you must win her heart , and if she has an inclination for another , you must drive it out and win her for yourself .
Her mother loves her so dearly that she has no ease but in her presence , and she will give her to no one in marriage .
Teach her to love you so that she can not exist without you .
But if the matter becomes known to her mother she will have you burned in the fire .
Then you must beg , as a last favour , that your body may be anointed with oil so that you may burn the more quickly and be spared torture .
If the peri-king allows this favour , we two will manage to be your anointers , and we will put an oil on you such that if you were a thousand years in the fire not a trace of burning would remain . ''
` In the end the two peris took me to the girl 's house .
I saw her sleeping daintily .
She was most lovely , and I was so amazed at the perfection of her beauty that I stood with senses lost , and did not know if she were real or a dream .
When at last I saw that she was a real girl , I returned thanks that I , the runner , had come to my goal , and that I , the seeker , had found my treasure .
` When the peri opened her eyes she asked in affright : `` Who are you ?
Have you come to steal ?
How did you get here ?
Be quick !
save yourself from this whirlpool of destruction , for the demons and peris .
who guard me will wake and seize you . ''
` But love 's arrow had struck me deep , and the girl , too , looked kindly on me .
I could not go away .
For some months I remained hidden in her house .
` We did not dare to let her mother know of our love .
Sometimes the girl was very sad and fearful lest her mother should come to know .
One day her father said to her : `` Sweetheart , for some time I have noticed that your beauty is not what it was .
How is this ?
Has sickness touched you ?
Tell me that I may seek a cure . ''
Alas !
there was now no way of concealing the mingled delight and anguish of our love ; from secret it became known .
I was put in prison and the world grew dark to my rose , bereft of her lover .
` The peri-king ordered me to be burnt , and said : `` Why have you , a man , done this perfidious thing in my house ? ''
His demons and peris .
collected amber-wood and made a pile , and would have set me on it , when I remembered the word of life which the two peris .
I had rescued had breathed into my ear , and I asked that my body might be rubbed with oil to release me the sooner from torture .
This was allowed , and those two contrived to be the anointers .
I was put into the fire and it was kept up for seven days and nights .
By the will of the Great King it left no trace upon me .
At the end of a week the pert-king ordered the ashes to be cast upon the dust-heap , and I was found alive and unharmed .
` Peris who had seen Gul consumed by her love for me now interceded with the king , and said : `` It is clear that your daughter 's fortunes are bound up with his , for the fire has not hurt him .
It is best to give him the girl , for they love one another .
He is King of Waq of Qaf , and you will find none better . ''
` To this the king agreed , and made formal marriage between Gul and me .
You now know the price I paid for this faithless creature .
O prince !
remember our compact . ' '
I remember , ' said the prince ; ` but tell me what brought Queen Gul to her present pass ? '
` One night , ' continued King Sinaubar , ' I was aroused by feeling Gul 's hands and feet , deadly cold , against my body .
I asked her where she had been to get so cold , and she said she had had to go out .
Next morning , when I went to my stable I saw that two of my horses , Windfoot and Tiger , were thin and worn out .
I reprimanded the groom and beat him .
He asked where his fault lay , and said that every night my wife took one or other of these horses and rode away , and came back only just before dawn .
A flame kindled in my heart , and I asked myself where she could go and what she could do .
I told the groom to be silent , and when next Gul took a horse from the stable to saddle another quickly and bring it to me .
That day I did not hunt , but stayed at home to follow the matter up .
I lay down as usual at night and pretended to fall asleep .
When I seemed safely off Gul got up and went to the stable as her custom was .
That night it was Tiger 's turn .
She rode off on him , and I took Windfoot and followed .
With me went that dog you see , a faithful friend who never left me .
` When I came to the foot of those hills which lie outside the city I saw Gul dismount and go towards a house which some negroes have built there .
Over against the door was a high seat , and on it lay a giant negro , before whom she salaamed .
He got up and beat her till she was marked with weals , but she uttered no complaint .
I was dumfounded , for once when I had struck her with a rose stalk she had complained and fretted for three days !
Then the negro said to her : `` How now , ugly one and shaven head !
Why are you so late , and why are you not wearing wedding garments ? ''
She answered him : `` That person did not go to sleep quickly , and he stayed at home all day , so that I was not able to adorn myself .
I came as soon as I could . ''
In a little while he called her to sit beside him ; but this was more than I could bear .
I lost control of myself and rushed upon him .
He clutched my collar and we grappled in a death struggle .
Suddenly she came behind me , caught my feet and threw me .
While he held me on the ground , she drew out my own knife and gave it to him .
I should have been killed but for that faithful dog which seized his throat and pulled him down and pinned him to the ground .
Then I got up and despatched the wretch .
There were four other negroes at the place ; three I killed and the fourth got away , and has taken refuge beneath the throne of Mihr-afruz , daughter of King Quimus .
I took Gul back to my palace , and from that time till now I have treated her as a dog is treated , and I have cared for my dog as though it were my wife .
Now you know what the rose did to the cypress ; and now you must keep compact with me . ' '
I shall keep my word , ' said the prince ; ` but may a little water be taken to the roof so that I may make my last ablution ? '
To this request the king consented .
The prince mounted to the roof , and , getting into a corner , struck his fire-steel and burned one of the Sirurgh 's feathers in the flame .
Straightway it appeared , and by the majesty of its presence made the city quake .
It took the prince on its back and soared away to the zenith .
After a time King Sinaubar said : ` That young man is a long time on the roof ; go and bring him here . '
But there was no sign of the prince upon the roof ; only , far away in the sky , the Simurgh was seen carrying him off .
When the king heard of his escape he thanked heaven that his hands were clean of this blood .
Up and up flew the Simurgh , till earth looked like an egg resting on an ocean .
At length it dropped straight down to its own place , where the kind prince was welcomed by the young birds and most hospitably entertained .
He told the whole story of the rose and the cypress , and then , laden with gifts which the Simurgh had gathered from cities far and near , he set his face for the Castle of Clashing Swords .
The king-lion came out to meet him ; he took the negro chief 's daughter -- whose name was also Gul -- in lawful marriage , and then marched with her and her possessions and her attendants to the Place of Gifts .
Here they halted for a night , and at dawn said good-bye to the king-lion and set out for Jamila 's country .
When the Lady Jamila heard that Prince Almas was near , she went out , with many a fair handmaid , to give him loving reception .
Their meeting was joyful , and they went together to the garden-palace .
Jamila summoned all her notables , and in their presence her marriage with the prince was solemnised .
A few days later she entrusted her affairs to her wazir , and made preparation to go with the prince to his own country .
Before she started she restored all the men whom her sister , Latifa , had bewitched , to their own forms , and received their blessings , and set them forward to their homes .
The wicked Latifa herself she left quite alone in her garden-house .
When all was ready they set out with all her servants and slaves , all her treasure and goods , and journeyed at ease to the city of King Quimus .
When King Quimus heard of the approach of such a great company , he sent out his wazir to give the prince honourable meeting , and to ask what had procured him the favour of the visit .
The prince sent back word that he had no thought of war , but he wrote : ` Learn and know , King Quimus , that I am here to end the crimes of your insolent daughter who has tyrannously done to death many kings and kings sons , and has hung their heads on your citadel .
I am here to give her the answer to her riddle . '
Later on he entered the city , beat boldly on the drums , and was conducted to the presence .
The king entreated him to have nothing to do with the riddle , for that no man had come out of it alive . '
O king ! '
replied the prince , ` it is to answer it that I am here ; I will not withdraw . '
Mihr-afruz was told that one man more had staked his head on her question , and that this was one who said he knew the answer .
At the request of the prince , all the officers and notables of the land were summoned to hear his reply to the princess .
All assembled , and the king and his queen Gul-rakh , and the girl and the prince were there .
The prince addressed Mihr-afruz : ` What is the question you ask ? '
` What did the rose do to the cypress ? '
she rejoined .
The prince smiled , and turned and addressed the assembly .
` You who are experienced men and versed in affairs , did you ever know or hear and see anything of this matter ? '
` No ! '
they answered , ` no one has ever known or heard or seen aught about it ; it is an empty fancy . '
` From whom , then , did the princess hear of it ?
This empty fancy it is that has done many a servant of God to death ! '
All saw the good sense of his words and showed their approval .
Then he turned to the princess : ` Tell us the truth , princess ; who told you of this thing ?
I know it hair by hair , and in and out ; but if I tell you what I know , who is there that can say I speak the truth ?
You must produce the person who can confirm my words . '
Her heart sank , for she feared that her long-kept secret was now to be noised abroad .
But she said merely : ` Explain yourself . ' '
I shall explain myself fully when you bring here the negro whom you hide beneath your throne . '
Here the king shouted in wonderment : ` Explain yourself , young man !
What negro does my daughter hide beneath her throne ? '
` That , ' said the prince , ` you will see if you order to be brought here the negro who will be found beneath the throne of the princess . '
Messengers were forthwith despatched to the garden house , and after awhile they returned bringing a negro whom they had discovered in a secret chamber underneath the throne of Mihr-afruz , dressed in a dress of honour , and surrounded with luxury .
The king was overwhelmed with astonishment , but the girl had taken heart again .
She had had time to think that perhaps the prince had heard of the presence of the negro , and knew no more .
So she said haughtily : ` Prince !
you have not answered my riddle . ' '
O most amazingly impudent person , ' cried he , ` do you not yet repent ? '
Then he turned to the people , and told them the whole story of the rose and the cypress , of King Sinaubar and Queen Gul .
When he came to the killing of the negroes , he said to the one who stood before them : ` You , too , were present . '
` That is so ; all happened as you have told it ! '
There was great rejoicing in the court and all through the country over the solving of the riddle , and because now no more kings and princes would be killed .
King Quimus made over his daughter to Prince Almas , but the latter refused to marry her , and took her as his captive .
He then asked that the heads should be removed from the battlements and given decent burial .
This was done .
He received from the king everything that belonged to Mihr-afruz ; her treasure of gold and silver ; her costly stuffs and carpets ; her household plenishing ; her horses and camels ; her servants and slaves .
Then he returned to his camp and sent for Dil-aram , who came bringing her goods and chattels , her gold and her jewels .
When all was ready , Prince Almas set out for home , taking with him Jamila , and Dil-aram and Gul , daughter of Taram-taq , and the wicked Mihr-afruz , and all the belongings of the four , packed on horses and camels , and in carts without number .
As he approached the borders of his father 's country word of his coming went before him , and all the city came forth to give him welcome .
King Saman-lal-posh -- Jessamine , wearer of rubies -- had so bewept the loss of his sons that he was now blind .
When the prince had kissed his feet and received his blessing , he took from a casket a little collyrium of Solomon , which the Simurgh had given him , and which reveals the hidden things of earth , and rubbed it on his father 's eyes .
Light came , and the king saw his son .
Mihr-afruz was brought before the king , and the prince said : ` This is the murderer of your sons ; do with her as you will . '
The king fancied that the prince might care for the girl 's beauty , and replied : ` You have humbled her ; do with her as you will . '
Upon this the prince sent for four swift and strong horses , and had the negro bound to each one of them ; then each was driven to one of the four quarters , and he tore in pieces like muslin .
This frightened Mihr-afruz horribly , for she thought the same thing might be done to herself .
She cried out to the prince : ' O Prince Almas !
what is hardest to get is most valued .
Up till now I have been subject to no man , and no man had had my love .
The many kings and kings sons who have died at my hands have died because it was their fate to die like this .
In this matter I have not sinned .
That was their fate from eternity ; and from the beginning it was predestined that my fate should be bound up with yours . '
The prince gave ear to the argument from pre-ordainment , and as she was a very lovely maiden he took her too in lawful marriage .
She and Jamila , set up house together , and Dil-aram and Gul set up theirs ; and the prince passed the rest of his life with the four in perfect happiness , and in pleasant and sociable entertainment .
Now has been told what the rose did to the cypress .
Finished , finished , finished !

Ball-carrier and the Bad One Far , far in the forest there were two little huts , and in each of them lived a man who was a famous hunter , his wife , and three or four children .
Now the children were forbidden to play more than a short distance from the door , as it was known that , away on the other side of the wood near the great river , there dwelt a witch who had a magic ball that she used as a means of stealing children .
Her plan was a very simple one , and had never yet failed .
When she wanted a child she just flung her ball in the direction of the child 's home , and however far off it might be , the ball was sure to reach it .
Then , as soon as the child saw it , the ball would begin rolling slowly back to the witch , just keeping a little ahead of the child , so that he always thought that he could catch it the next minute .
But he never did , and , what was more , his parents never saw him again .
Of course you must not suppose that all the fathers and mothers who had lost children made no attempts to find them , but the forest was so large , and the witch was so cunning in knowing exactly where they were going to search , that it was very easy for her to keep out of the way .
Besides , there was always the chance that the children might have been eaten by wolves , of which large herds roamed about in winter .
One day the old witch happened to want a little boy , so she threw her ball in the direction of the hunters ' huts .
A child was standing outside , shooting at a mark with his bow and arrows , but the moment he saw the ball , which was made of glass whose blues and greens and whites , all frosted over , kept changing one into the other , he flung down his bow , and stooped to pick the ball up .
But as he did so it began to roll very gently downhill .
The boy could not let it roll away , when it was so close to him , so he gave chase .
The ball seemed always within his grasp , yet he could never catch it ; it went quicker and quicker , and the boy grew more and more excited .
That time he almost touched it -- no , he missed it by a hair 's breadth !
Now , surely , if he gave a spring he could get in front of it !
He sprang forward , tripped and fell , and found himself in the witch 's house !
` Welcome !
welcome !
grandson ! '
said she ; ` get up and rest yourself , for you have had a long walk , and I am sure you must be tired ! '
So the boy sat down , and ate some food which she gave him in a bowl .
It was quite different from anything he had tasted before , and he thought it was delicious .
When he had eaten up every bit , the witch asked him if he had ever fasted .
` No , ' replied the boy , ` at least I have been obliged to sometimes , but never if there was any food to be had . '
` You will have to fast if you want the spirits to make you strong and wise , and the sooner you begin the better . '
` Very well , ' said the boy , ` what do I do first ? '
` Lie down on those buffalo skins by the door of the hut , ' answered she ; and the boy lay down , and the squirrels and little bears and the birds came and talked to him .
At the end of ten days the old woman came to him with a bowl of the same food that he had eaten before .
` Get up , my grandson , you have fasted long enough .
Have the good spirits visited you , and granted you the strength and wisdom that you desire ? '
` Some of them have come , and have given me a portion of both , ' answered the boy , ` but many have stayed away from me . '
` Then , ' said she , ` you must fast ten days more . '
So the boy lay down again on the buffalo skins , and fasted for ten days , and at the end of that time he turned his face to the wall , and fasted for twenty days longer .
At length the witch called to him , and said : ` Come and eat something , my grandson . '
At the sound of her voice the boy got up and ate the food she gave him .
When he had finished every scrap she spoke as before : ` Tell me , my grandson , have not the good spirits visited you all these many days that you have fasted ? '
` Not all , grandmother , ' answered he ; ` there are still some who keep away from me and say that I have not fasted long enough . '
` Then you must fast again , ' replied the old woman , ` and go on fasting till you receive the gifts of all the good spirits .
Not one must be missing . '
The boy said nothing , but lay down for the third time on the buffalo skins , and fasted for twenty days more .
And at the end of that time the witch thought he was dead , his face was so white and his body so still .
But when she had fed him out of the bowl he grew stronger , and soon was able to sit up .
` You have fasted a long time , ' said she , ` longer than anyone ever fasted before .
Surely the good spirits must be satisfied now ? '
` Yes , grandmother , ' answered the boy , ` they have all come , and have given me their gifts . '
This pleased the old woman so much that she brought him another basin of food , and while he was eating it she talked to him , and this is what she said : ` Far away , on the other side of the great river , is the home of the Bad One .
In his house is much gold , and what is more precious even than the gold , a little bridge , which lengthens out when the Bad One waves his hand , so that there is no river or sea that he can not cross .
Now I want that bridge and some of the gold for myself , and that is the reason that I have stolen so many boys by means of my ball .
I have tried to teach them how to gain the gifts of the good spirits , but none of them would fast long enough , and at last I had to send them away to perform simple , easy little tasks .
But you have been strong and faithful , and you can do this thing if you listen to what I tell you !
When you reach the river tie this ball to your foot , and it will take you across -- you can not manage it in any other way .
But do not be afraid ; trust to the ball , and you will be quite safe ! '
The boy took the ball and put it in a bag .
Then he made himself a club and a bow , and some arrows which would fly further than anyone else 's arrows , because of the strength the good spirits had given him .
They had also bestowed on him the power of changing his shape , and had increased the quickness of his eyes and ears so that nothing escaped him .
And in some way or other they made him understand that if he needed more help they would give it to him .
When all these things were ready the boy bade farewell to the witch and set out .
He walked through the forest for several days without seeing anyone but his friends the squirrels and the bears and the birds , but though he stopped and spoke to them all , he was careful not to let them know where he was going .
At last , after many days , he came to the river , and beyond it he noticed a small hut standing on a hill which he guessed to be the home of the Bad One .
But the stream flowed so quickly that he could not see how he was ever to cross it , and in order to test how swift the current really was , he broke a branch from a tree and threw it in .
It seemed hardly to touch the water before it was carried away , and even his magic sight could not follow it .
He could not help feeling frightened , but he hated giving up anything that he had once undertaken , and , fastening the ball on his right foot , he ventured on the river .
To his surprise he was able to stand up ; then a panic seized him , and he scrambled up the bank again .
In a minute or two he plucked up courage to go a little further into the river , but again its width frightened him , and a second time he turned back .
However , he felt rather ashamed of his cowardice , as it was quite clear that his ball could support him , and on his third trial he got safely to the other side .
Once there he replaced the ball in the bag , and looked carefully round him .
The door of the Bad One 's hut was open , and he saw that the ceiling was supported by great wooden beams , from which hung the bags of gold and the little bridge .
He saw , too , the Bad One sitting in the midst of his treasures eating his dinner , and drinking something out of a horn .
It was plain to the boy that he must invent some plan of getting the Bad One out of the way , or else he would never be able to steal the gold or the bridge .
What should he do ?
Give horrible shrieks as if he were in pain ?
But the Bad One would not care whether he were murdered or not !
Call him by his name ?
But the Bad One was very cunning , and would suspect some trick .
He must try something better than that !
Then suddenly an idea came to him , and he gave a little jump of joy .
` Oh , how stupid of me not to think of that before ! '
said he , and he wished with all his might that the Bad One should become very hungry -- so hungry that he could not wait a moment for fresh food to be brought to him .
And sure enough at that instant the Bad One called out to his servant , ` You did not bring food that would satisfy a sparrow Fetch some more at once , for I am perfectly starving . '
Then , without giving the woman time to go to the larder , he got up from his chair , and rolled , staggering from hunger , towards the kitchen .
Directly the door had closed on the Bad One the boy ran in , pulled down a bag of gold from the beam , and tucked it under his left arm .
Next he unhooked the little bridge and put it under his right .
He did not try to escape , as most boys of his age would have done , for the wisdom put into his mind by the good spirits taught him that before he could reach the river and make use of the bridge the Bad One would have tracked him by his footsteps and been upon him .
So , making himself very small and thin , he hid himself behind a pile of buffalo skins in the corner , first tearing a slit through one of them , so that he could see what was going on .
He had hardly settled himself when the servant entered the room , and , as she did so , the last bag of gold on the beam fell to the ground -- for they had begun to fall directly the boy had taken the first one .
She cried to her master that someone had stolen both the bag and the bridge , and the Bad One rushed in , mad with anger , and bade her go and seek for footsteps outside , that they might find out where the thief had gone .
In a few minutes she returned , saying that he must be in the house , as she could not see any footsteps leading to the river , and began to move all the furniture in the room , without discovering Ball Carrier .
` But he must be here somewhere , ' she said to herself , examining for the second time the pile of buffalo skins ; and Ball-Carrier , knowing that he could not possibly escape now , hastily wished that the Bad One should be unable to eat any more food at present .
` Ah , there is a slit in this one , ' cried the servant , shaking the skin ; ` and here he is . '
And she pulled out Ball-Carrier , looking so lean and small that he would hardly have made a mouthful for a sparrow .
` Was it you who took my gold and bridge ? '
asked the Bad One .
` Yes , ' answered Ball-Carrier , ` it was I who took them . '
The Bad One made a sign to the woman , who inquired where he had hidden them .
He lifted his left arm where the gold was , and she picked up a knife and scraped his skin so that no gold should be left sticking to it .
` What have you done with the bridge ? '
said she .
And he lifted his right arm , from which she took the bridge , while the Bad One looked on , well pleased .
` Be sure that he does not run away , ' chuckled he .
` Boil some water , and get him ready for cooking , while I go and invite my friends the water-demons to the feast . '
The woman seized Ball-Carrier between her finger and thumb , and was going to carry him to the kitchen , when the boy spoke : ' I am very lean and small now , ' he said , ` hardly worth the trouble of cooking ; but if you were to keep me two days , and gave me plenty of food , I should get big and fat .
As it is , your friends the water-demons would think you meant to laugh at them , when they found that I was the feast . '
` Well , perhaps you are right , ' answered the Bad One ; ' I will keep you for two days . '
And he went out to visit the water-demons .
Meanwhile the servant , whose name was Lung Woman , led him into a little shed , and chained him up to a ring in the wall .
But food was given him every hour , and at the end of two days he was as fat and big as a Christmas turkey , and could hardly move his head from one side to the other .
` He will do now , ' said the Bad One , who came constantly to see how he was getting on . '
I shall go and tell the water-demons that we expect them to dinner to-night .
Put the kettle on the fire , but be sure on no account to taste the broth . '
Lung-Woman lost no time in obeying her orders .
She built up the fire , which had got very low , filled the kettle with water , and passing a rope which hung from the ceiling through the handle , swung it over the flames .
Then she brought in Ball-Carrier , who , seeing all these preparations , wished that as long as he was in the kettle the water might not really boil , though it would hiss and bubble , and also , that the spirits would turn the water into fat .
The kettle soon began to sing and bubble , and Ball Carrier was lifted in .
Very soon the fat which was to make the sauce rose to the surface , and Ball-Carrier , who was bobbing about from one side to the other , called out that Lung-Woman had better taste the broth , as he though that some salt should be added to it .
The servant knew quite well that her master had forbidden her to do any thing of the kind , but when once the idea was put into her head , she found the smell from the kettle so delicious that she unhooked a long ladle from the wall and plunged it into the kettle .
` You will spill it all , if you stand so far off , ' said the boy ; ` why do n't you come a little nearer ? '
And as she did so he cried to the spirits to give him back his usual size and strength and to make the water scalding hot Then he gave the kettle a kick , which upset all the boiling water upon her , and jumping over her body he seized once more the gold and the bridge , picked up his club and bow and arrows , and after setting fire to the Bad One 's hut , ran down to the river , which he crossed safely by the help of the bridge .
The hut , which was made of wood , was burned to the ground before the Bad One came back with a large crowd of water-demons .
There was not a sign of anyone or anything , so he started for the river , where he saw Ball Carrier sitting quietly on the other side .
Then the Bad One knew what had happened , and after telling the water demons that there would be no feast after all , he called to Ball-Carrier , who was eating an apple . '
I know your name now , ' he said , ` and as you have ruined me , and I am not rich any more , will you take me as your servant ? '
` Yes , I will , though you have tried to kill me , ' answered Ball-Carrier , throwing the bridge across the water as he spoke .
But when the Bad One was in the midst of the stream , the boy wished it to become small ; and the Bad One fell into the water and was drowned , and the world was rid of him .

How Ball-carrier Finished His Task After Ball-Carrier had managed to drown the Bad One so that he could not do any more mischief , he forgot the way to his grandmother 's house , and could not find it again , though he searched everywhere .
During this time he wandered into many strange places , and had many adventures ; and one day he came to a hut where a young girl lived .
He was tired and hungry and begged her to let him in and rest , and he stayed a long while , and the girl became his wife .
One morning he saw two children playing in front of the hut , and went out to speak to them .
But as soon as they saw him they set up cries of horror and ran away .
` They are the children of my sister who has been on a long journey , ' replied his wife , ` and now that she knows you are my husband she wants to kill you . '
` Oh , well , let her try , ' replied Ball-Carrier .
` It is not the first time people have wished to do that .
And here I am still , you see ! '
` Be careful , ' said the wife , ` she is very cunning . '
But at this moment the sister-in-law came up .
` How do you do , brother-in-law ?
I have heard of you so often that I am very glad to meet you .
I am told that you are more powerful than any man on earth , and as I am powerful too , let us try which is the strongest . '
` That will be delightful , ' answered he .
` Suppose we begin with a short race , and then we will go on to other things . '
` That will suit me very well , ' replied the woman , who was a witch .
` And let us agree that the one who wins shall have the right to kill the other . '
` Oh , certainly , ' said Ball-Carrier ; ' and I do n't think we shall find a flatter course than the prairie itself -- no one knows how many miles it stretches .
We will run to the end and back again . '
This being settled they both made ready for the race , and Ball-Carrier silently begged the good spirits to help him , and not to let him fall into the hands of this wicked witch .
` When the sun touches the trunk of that tree we will start , ' said she , as they both stood side by side .
But with the first step Ball-Carrier changed himself into a wolf and for a long way kept ahead .
Then gradually he heard her creeping up behind him , and soon she was in front .
So Ball-Carrier took the shape of a pigeon and flew rapidly past her , but in a little while she was in front again and the end of the prairie was in sight . '
A crow can fly faster than a pigeon , ' thought he , and as a crow he managed to pass her and held his ground so long that he fancied she was quite beaten .
The witch began to be afraid of it too , and putting out all her strength slipped past him .
Next he put on the shape of a hawk , and in this form he reached the bounds of the prairie , he and the witch turning homewards at the moment .
Bird after bird he tried , but every time the witch gained on him and took the lead .
At length the goal was in sight , and Ball-Carrier knew that unless he could get ahead now he would be killed before his own door , under the eyes of his wife .
His eyes had grown dim from fatigue , his wings flapped wearily and hardly bore him along , while the witch seemed as fresh as ever .
What bird was there whose flight was swifter than his ?
Would not the good spirits tell him ?
Ah , of course he knew ; why had he not thought of it at first and spared himself all that fatigue ?
And the next instant a humming bird , dressed in green and blue , flashed past the woman and entered the house .
The witch came panting up , furious at having lost the race which she felt certain of winning ; and Ball-Carrier , who had by this time changed back into his own shape , struck her on the head and killed her .
For a long while Ball-Carrier was content to stay quietly at home with his wife and children , for he was tired of adventures , and only did enough hunting to supply the house with food .
But one day he happened to eat some poisonous berries that he had found in the forest , and grew so ill that he felt he was going to die .
` When I am dead do not bury me in the earth , ' he said , ` but put me over there , among that clump of trees . '
So his wife and her three children watched by him as long as he was alive , and after he was dead they took him up and laid the body on a platform of stakes which they had prepared in the grove .
And as they returned weeping to the hut they caught a glimpse of the ball rolling away down the path back to the old grandmother .
One of the sons sprang forward to stop it , for Ball-Carrier had often told them the tale of how it had helped him to cross the river , but it was too quick for him , and they had to content themselves with the war club and bow and arrows , which were put carefully away .
By-and-by some travellers came past , and the chief among them asked leave to marry Ball-Carrier 's daughter .
The mother said she must have a little time to think over it , as her daughter was still very young ; so it was settled that the man should go away for a month with his friends , and then come back to see if the girl was willing .
Now ever since Ball-Carrier 's death the family had been very poor , and often could not get enough to eat .
One morning the girl , who had had no supper and no breakfast , wandered off to look for cranberries , and though she was quite near home was astonished at noticing a large hut , which certainly had not been there when last she had come that way .
No one was about , so she ventured to peep in , and her surprise was increased at seeing , heaped up in one corner , a quantity of food of all sorts , while a little robin redbreast stood perched on a beam looking down upon her .
` It is my father , I am sure , ' she cried ; and the bird piped in answer .
From that day , whenever they wanted food they went to the hut , and though the robin could not speak , he would hop on their shoulders and let them feed him with the food they knew he liked best .
When the man came back he found the girl looking so much prettier and fatter than when he had left her , that he insisted that they should be married on the spot .
And the mother , who did not know how to get rid of him , gave in .
The husband spent all his time in hunting , and the family had never had so much meat before ; but the man , who had seen for himself how poor they were , noticed with amazement that they did not seem to care about it , or to be hungry .
` They must get food from somewhere , ' he thought , and one morning , when he pretended to be going out to hunt , he hid in a thicket to watch .
Very soon they all left the house together , and walked to the other hut , which the girl 's husband saw for the first time , as it was hid in a hollow .
He followed , and noticed that each one went up to the redbreast , and shook him by the claw ; and he then entered boldly and shook the bird 's claw too .
The whole party afterwards sat down to dinner , after which they all returned to their own hut .
The next day the husband declared that he was very ill , and could not eat anything ; but this was only a presence so that he might get what he wanted .
The family were all much distressed , and begged him to tell them what food he fancied .
` Oh !
I could not eat any food , ' he answered every time , and at each answer his voice grew fainter and fainter , till they thought he would die from weakness before their eyes .
` There must be some thing you could take , if you would only say what it is , ' implored his wife .
` No , nothing , nothing ; except , perhaps -- but of course that is impossible ! '
` No , I am sure it is not , ' replied she ; ` you shall have it , I promise -- only tell me what it is . ' '
I think -- but I could not ask you to do such a thing .
Leave me alone , and let me die quietly . '
` You shall not die , ' cried the girl , who was very fond of her husband , for he did not beat her as most girls ' husbands did .
` Whatever it is , I will manage to get it for you . '
` Well , then , I think , if I had that -- redbreast , nicely roasted , I could eat a little bit of his wing ! '
The wife started back in horror at such a request ; but the man turned his face to the wall , and took no notice , as he thought it was better to leave her to herself for a little .
Weeping and wringing her hands , the girl went down to her mother .
The brothers were very angry when they heard the story , and declared that , if any one were to die , it certainly should not be the robin .
But all that night the man seemed getting weaker and weaker , and at last , quite early , the wife crept out , and stealing to the hut , killed the bird , and brought him home to her husband .
Just as she was going to cook it her two brothers came in .
They cried out in horror at the sight , and , rushing out of the hut , declared they would never see her any more .
And the poor girl , with a heavy heart , took the body of the redbreast up to her husband .
But directly she entered the room the man told her that he felt a great deal better , and that he would rather have a piece of bear 's flesh , well boiled , than any bird , however tender .
His wife felt very miserable to think that their beloved redbreast had been sacrificed for nothing , and begged him to try a little bit .
` You felt so sure that it would do you good before , ' said she , ` that I ca n't help thinking it would quite cure you now . '
But the man only flew into a rage , and flung the bird out of the window .
Then he got up and went out .
Now all this while the ball had been rolling , rolling , rolling to the old grandmother 's hut on the other side of the world , and directly it rolled into her hut she knew that her grandson must be dead .
Without wasting any time she took a fox skin and tied it round her forehead , and fastened another round her waist , as witches always do when they leave their own homes .
When she was ready she said to the ball : ` Go back the way you came , and lead me to my grandson . '
And the ball started with the old woman following .
It was a long journey , even for a witch , but , like other things , it ended at last ; and the old woman stood before the platform of stakes , where the body of Ball-Carrier lay .
` Wake up , my grandson , it is time to go home , ' the witch said .
And Ball-Carrier stepped down oft the platform , and brought his club and bow and arrows out of the hut , and set out , for the other side of the world , behind the old woman .
When they reached the hut where Ball-Carrier had fasted so many years ago , the old woman spoke for the first time since they had started on their way .
` My grandson , did you ever manage to get that gold from the Bad One ? '
` Yes , grandmother , I got it . '
` Where is it ? '
she asked .
` Here , in my left arm-pit , ' answered he .
So she picked up a knife and scraped away all the gold which had stuck to his skin , and which had been sticking there ever since he first stole it .
After she had finished she asked again : ` My grandson , did you manage to get that bridge from the Bad One ? '
` Yes , grandmother , I got that too , ' answered he .
` Where is it ? '
she asked , and Ball-Carrier lifted his right arm , and pointed to his arm-pit .
` Here is the bridge , grandmother , ' said he .
Then the witch did something that nobody in the world could have guessed that she would do .
First , she took the gold and said to Ball-carrier : ` My grandson , this gold must be hidden in the earth , for if people think they can get it when they choose , they will become lazy and stupid .
But if we take it and bury it in different parts of the world they will have to work for it if they want it , and then will only find a little at a time . '
And as she spoke , she pulled up one of the poles of the hut , and Ball-Carrier saw that underneath was a deep , deep hole , which seemed to have no bottom .
Down this hole she poured all the gold , and when it was out of sight it ran about all over the world , where people that dig hard sometimes find it .
And after that was done she put the pole back again .
Next she lifted down a spade from a high shelf , where it had grown quite rusty , and dug a very small hole on the opposite side of the hut -- very small , but very deep .
` Give me the bridge , ' said she , ` for I am going to bury it here .
If anyone was to get hold of it , and find that they could cross rivers and seas without any trouble , they would never discover how to cross them for themselves .
I am a witch , and if I had chosen I could easily have cast my spells over the Bad One , and have made him deliver them to you the first day you came into my hut .
But then you would never have fasted , and never have planned how to get what you wanted , and never have known the good spirits , and would have been fat and idle to the end of your days .
And now go ; in that hut , which you can just see far away , live your father and mother , who are old people now , and need a son to hunt for them .
You have done what you were set to do , and I need you no more . '
Then Ball-Carrier remembered his parents and went back to them .

The Bunyip Long , long ago , far , far away on the other side of the world , some young men left the camp where they lived to get some food for their wives and children .
The sun was hot , but they liked heat , and as they went they ran races and tried who could hurl his spear the farthest , or was cleverest in throwing a strange weapon called a boomerang , which always returns to the thrower .
They did not get on very fast at this rate , but presently they reached a flat place that in time of flood was full of water , but was now , in the height of summer , only a set of pools , each surrounded with a fringe of plants , with bulrushes standing in the inside of all .
In that country the people are fond of the roots of bulrushes , which they think as good as onions , and one of the young men said that they had better collect some of the roots and carry them back to the camp .
It did not take them long to weave the tops of the willows into a basket , and they were just going to wade into the water and pull up the bulrush roots when a youth suddenly called out : ` After all , why should we waste our time in doing work that is only fit for women and children ?
Let them come and get the roots for themselves ; but we will fish for eels and anything else we can get . '
This delighted the rest of the party , and they all began to arrange their fishing lines , made from the bark of the yellow mimosa , and to search for bait for their hooks .
Most of them used worms , but one , who had put a piece of raw meat for dinner into his skin wallet , cut off a little bit and baited his line with it , unseen by his companions .
For a long time they cast patiently , without receiving a single bite ; the sun had grown low in the sky , and it seemed as if they would have to go home empty-handed , not even with a basket of roots to show ; when the youth , who had baited his hook with raw meat , suddenly saw his line disappear under the water .
Something , a very heavy fish he supposed , was pulling so hard that he could hardly keep his feet , and for a few minutes it seemed either as if he must let go or be dragged into the pool .
He cried to his friends to help him , and at last , trembling with fright at what they were going to see , they managed between them to land on the bank a creature that was neither a calf nor a seal , but something of both , with a long , broad tail .
They looked at each other with horror , cold shivers running down their spines ; for though they had never beheld it , there was not a man amongst them who did not know what it was -- the cub of the awful Bunyip !
All of a sudden the silence was broken by a low wail , answered by another from the other side of the pool , as the mother rose up from her den and came towards them , rage flashing from her horrible yellow eyes .
` Let it go !
let it go ! '
whispered the young men to each other ; but the captor declared that he had caught it , and was going to keep it .
` He had promised his sweetheart , ' he said , ` that he would bring back enough meat for her father 's house to feast on for three days , and though they could not eat the little Bunyip , her brothers and sisters should have it to play with . '
So , flinging his spear at the mother to keep her back , he threw the little Bunyip on to his shoulders , and set out for the camp , never heeding the poor mother 's cries of distress .
By this time it was getting near sunset , and the plain was in shadow , though the tops of the mountains were still quite bright .
The youths had all ceased to be afraid , when they were startled by a low rushing sound behind them , and , looking round , saw that the pool was slowly rising , and the spot where they had landed the Bunyip was quite covered .
` What could it be ? '
they asked one of another ; ` there was not a cloud in the sky , yet the water had risen higher already than they had ever known it do before . '
For an instant they stood watching as if they were frozen , then they turned and ran with all their might , the man with the Bunyip running faster than all .
When he reached a high peak over-looking all the plain he stopped to take breath , and turned to see if he was safe yet .
Safe !
why only the tops of the trees remained above that sea of water , and these were fast disappearing .
They must run fast indeed if they were to escape .
So on they flew , scarcely feeling the ground as they went , till they flung themselves on the ground before the holes scooped out of the earth where they had all been born .
The old men were sitting in front , the children were playing , and the women chattering together , when the little Bunyip fell into their midst , and there was scarcely a child among them who did not know that something terrible was upon them .
` The water !
the water ! '
gasped one of the young men ; and there it was , slowly but steadily mounting the ridge itself .
Parents and children clung together , as if by that means they could drive back the advancing flood ; and the youth who had caused all this terrible catastrophe , seized his sweetheart , and cried : ' I will climb with you to the top of that tree , and there no waters can reach us . '
But , as he spoke , something cold touched him , and quickly he glanced down at his feet .
Then with a shudder he saw that they were feet no longer , but bird 's claws .
He looked at the girl he was clasping , and beheld a great black bird standing at his side ; he turned to his friends , but a flock of great awkward flapping creatures stood in their place He put up his hands to cover his face , but they were no more hands , only the ends of wings ; and when he tried to speak , a noise such as he had never heard before seemed to come from his throat , which had suddenly become narrow and slender .
Already the water had risen to his waist , and he found himself sitting easily upon it , while its surface reflected back the image of a black swan , one of many .
Never again did the swans become men ; but they are still different from other swans , for in the night-time those who listen can hear them talk in a language that is certainly not swan 's language ; and there are even sounds of laughing and talking , unlike any noise made by the swans whom we know .
The little Bunyip was carried home by its mother , and after that the waters sank back to their own channels .
The side of the pool where she lives is always shunned by everyone , as nobody knows when she may suddenly put out her head and draw him into her mighty jaws .
But people say that underneath the black waters of the pool she has a house filled with beautiful things , such as mortals who dwell on the earth have no idea of .
Though how they know I can not tell you , as nobody has ever seen it .

Father Grumbler Once upon a time there lived a man who had nearly as many children as there were sparrows in the garden .
He had to work very hard all day to get them enough to eat , and was often tired and cross , and abused everything and everybody , so that people called him ` Father Grumbler . '
By-and-by he grew weary of always working , and on Sundays he lay a long while in bed , instead of going to church .
Then after a time he found it dull to sit so many hours by himself , thinking of nothing but how to pay the rent that was owing , and as the tavern across the road looked bright and cheerful , he walked in one day and sat down with his friends .
` It was just to chase away Care , ' he said ; but when he came out , hours and hours after , Care came out with him .
Father Grumbler entered his house feeling more dismal than when he left it , for he knew that he had wasted both his time and his money . '
I will go and see the Holy Man in the cave near the well , ' he said to himself , ` and perhaps he can tell me why all the luck is for other people , and only misfortunes happen to me . '
And he set out at once for the cave .
It was a long way off , and the road led over mountains and through valleys ; but at last he reached the cave where the Holy Man dwelt , and knocked at the door .
` Who is there ? '
asked a voice from within .
` It is I , Holy Man , Father Grumbler , you know , who has as many children as sparrows in the garden . '
` Well , and what is it that you want ? ' '
I want to know why other people have all the luck , and only misfortunes happen to me ! '
The Holy Man did not answer , but went into an inner cave , from which he came out bearing something in his hand .
` Do you see this basket ? '
said he .
` It is a magical basket , and if you are hungry you have only got to say : `` Little basket , little basket , do your duty , '' and you will eat the best dinner you ever had in your life .
But when you have had enough , be sure you do n't forget to cry out : `` That will do for to-day . ''
Oh !
-- and one thing more -- you need not show it to everybody and declare that I have give it to you .
Do you understand ? '
Father Grumbler was always accustomed to think of himself as so unlucky that he did not know whether the Holy Man was not playing a trick upon him ; but he took the basket without being polite enough to say either ` Thank you , ' or ` Good-morning , ' and went away .
However , he only waited till he was out of sight of the cave before he stooped down and whispered : ` Little basket , little basket , do your duty . '
Now the basket had a lid , so that he could not see what was inside , but he heard quite clearly strange noises , as if a sort of scuffling was going on .
Then the lid burst open , and a quantity of delicious little white rolls came tumbling out one after the other , followed by a stream of small fishes all ready cooked .
What a quantity there were to be sure !
The whole road was covered with them , and the banks on each side were beginning to disappear .
Father Grumbler felt quite frightened at the torrent , but at last he remembered what the Holy Man had told him , and cried at the top of his voice : ` Enough !
enough !
That will do for to-day ! '
And the lid of the basket closed with a snap .
Father Grumbler sighed with relief and happiness as he looked around him , and sitting down on a heap of stones , he ate till he could eat no more .
Trout , salmon , turbot , soles , and a hundred other fishes whose names he did not know , lay boiled , fried , and grilled within reach of his hands .
As the Holy Man had said , he had never eaten such a dinner ; still , when he had done , he shook his head , and grumbled ; ` Yes , there is plenty to eat , of course , but it only makes me thirsty , and there is not a drop to drink anywhere . '
Yet , somehow , he could never tell why , he looked up and saw the tavern in front of him , which he thought was miles , and miles , and miles away .
` Bring the best wine you have got , and two glasses , good mother , ' he said as he entered , ` and if you are fond of fish there is enough here to feed the house .
Only there is no need to chatter about it all over the place .
You understand ?
Eh ? '
And without waiting for an answer he whispered to the basket : ` Little basket , little basket , do your duty . '
The innkeeper and his wife thought that their customer had gone suddenly mad , and watched him closely , ready to spring on him if he became violent ; but both instinctively jumped backwards , nearly into the fire , as rolls and fishes of every kind came tumbling out of the basket , covering the tables and chairs and the floor , and even overflowing into the street .
` Be quick , be quick , and pick them up , ' cried the man .
` And if these are not enough , there are plenty more to be had for the asking . '
The innkeeper and his wife did not need telling twice .
Down they went on their knees and gathered up everything they could lay hands on .
But busy though they seemed , they found time to whisper to each other : ` If we can only get hold of that basket it will make our fortune ! '
So they began by inviting Father Grumbler to sit down to the table , and brought out the best wine in the cellar , hoping it might loosen his tongue .
But Father Grumbler was wiser than they gave him credit for , and though they tried in all manner of ways to find out who had given him the basket , he put them off , and kept his secret to himself .
Unluckily , though he did not SPEAK , he did drink , and it was not long before he fell fast asleep .
Then the woman fetched from her kitchen a basket , so like the magic one that no one , without looking very closely , could tell the difference , and placed it in Father Grumbler 's hand , while she hid the other carefully away .
It was dinner time when the man awoke , and , jumping up hastily , he set out for home , where he found all the children gathered round a basin of thin soup , and pushing their wooden bowls forward , hoping to have the first spoonful .
Their father burst into the midst of them , bearing his basket , and crying : ` Do n't spoil your appetites , children , with that stuff .
Do you see this basket ?
Well , I have only got to say , `` Little basket , little basket , do your duty , '' and you will see what will happen .
Now you shall say it instead of me , for a treat . '
The children , wondering and delighted , repeated the words , but nothing happened .
Again and again they tried , but the basket was only a basket , with a few scales of fish sticking to the bottom , for the innkeeper 's wife had taken it to market the day before .
` What is the matter with the thing ? '
cried the father at last , snatching the basket from them , and turning it all over , grumbling and swearing while he did so , under the eyes of his astonished wife and children , who did not know whether to cry or to laugh .
` It certainly smells of fish , ' he said , and then he stopped , for a sudden thought had come to him .
` Suppose it is not mine at all ; supposing -- Ah , the scoundrels ! '
And without listening to his wife and children , who were frightened at his strange conduct and begged him to stay at home , he ran across to the tavern and burst open the door .
` Can I do anything for you , Father Grumbler ? '
asked the innkeeper 's wife in her softest voice . '
I have taken the wrong basket -- by mistake , of course , ' said he .
` Here is yours , will you give me back my own ? '
` Why , what are you talking about ? '
answered she .
` You can see for yourself that there is no basket here . '
And though Father Grumbler DID look , it was quite true that none was to be seen .
` Come , take a glass to warm you this cold day , ' said the woman , who was anxious to keep him in a good temper , and as this was an invitation Father Grumbler never refused , he tossed it off and left the house .
He took the road that led to the Holy Man 's cave , and made such haste that it was not long before he reached it .
` Who is there ? '
said a voice in answer to his knock .
` It is me , it is me , Holy man .
You know quite well .
Father Grumbler , who has as many children as sparrows in the garden . '
` But , my good man , it was only yesterday that I gave you a handsome present . '
` Yes , Holy Man , and here it is .
But something has happened , I do n't know what , and it wo n't work any more . '
` Well , put it down .
I will go and see if I can find anything for you . '
In a few minutes the Holy Man returned with a cock under his arm .
` Listen to me , ' he said , ` whenever you want money , you only have to say : `` Show me what you can do , cock , '' and you will see some wonderful things .
But , remember , it is not necessary to let all the world into the secret . '
` Oh no , Holy Man , I am not so foolish as that . '
` Nor to tell everybody that I gave it to you , ' went on the Holy Man . '
I have not got these treasures by the dozen . '
And without waiting for an answer he shut the door .
As before , the distance seemed to have wonderfully shortened , and in a moment the tavern rose up in front of Father Grumbler .
Without stopping to think , he went straight in , and found the innkeeper 's wife in the kitchen making a cake .
` Where have you come from , with that fine red cock in your basket , ' asked she , for the bird was so big that the lid would not shut down properly .
` Oh , I come from a place where they do n't keep these things by the dozen , ' he replied , sitting down in front of the table .
The woman said no more , but set before him a bottle of his favourite wine , and soon he began to wish to display his prize .
` Show me what you can do , cock , ' cried he .
And the cock stood up and flapped his wings three times , crowing ` coquerico ' with a voice like a trumpet , and at each crow there fell from his beak golden drops , and diamonds as large as peas .
This time Father Grumbler did not invite the innkeeper 's wife to pick up his treasures , but put his own hat under the cock 's beak , so as to catch everything he let fall ; and he did not see the husband and wife exchanging glances with each other which said , ` That would be a splendid cock to put with our basket . '
` Have another glass of wine ? '
suggested the innkeeper , when they had finished admiring the beauty of the cock , for they pretended not to have seen the gold or the diamonds .
And Father Grumbler , nothing loth , drank one glass after another , till his head fell forward on the table , and once more he was sound asleep .
Then the woman gently coaxed the cock from the basket and carried it off to her own poultry yard , from which she brought one exactly like it , and popped it in its place .
Night was falling when the man awoke , and throwing proudly some grains of gold on the table to pay for the wine he had drunk , he tucked the cock comfortably into his basket and set out for home .
His wife and all the children were waiting for him at the door , and as soon as she caught sight of him she broke out : ` You are a nice man to go wasting your time and your money drinking in that tavern , and leaving us to starve !
Are n't you ashamed of yourself ? '
` You do n't know what you are talking of , ' he answered .
` Money ?
Why , I have gold and diamonds now , as much as I want .
Do you see that cock ?
Well , you have only to say to him , `` Show me what you can do , cock , '' and something splendid will happen . '
Neither wife nor children were inclined to put much faith in him after their last experience ; however , they thought it was worth trying , and did as he told them .
The cock flew round the room like a mad thing , and crowed till their heads nearly split with the noise ; but no gold or diamonds dropped on the brick floor -- not the tiniest grain of either .
Father Grumbler stared in silence for an instant , and then he began to swear so loudly that even his family , accustomed as they were to his language , wondered at him .
At last he grew a little quieter , but remained as puzzled as ever .
` Can I have forgotten the words ?
But I KNOW that was what he said !
And I saw the diamonds with my own eyes ! '
Then suddenly he seized the cock , shut it into the basket , and rushed out of the house .
His heavy wooden shoes clattered as he ran along the road , and he made such haste that the stars were only just beginning to come out when he reached the cave of the Holy Man .
` Who is that knocking ? '
asked a voice from within .
` It is me !
It is me !
Holy Man !
you know !
Father -- ' ` But , my good fellow , you really should give some one else a chance .
This is the third time you have been -- and at such an hour , too ! '
` Oh , yes , Holy Man , I know it is very late , but you will forgive me !
It is your cock -- there is something the matter .
It is like the basket .
Look ! '
` THAT my cock ?
THAT my basket ?
Somebody has played you a trick , my good man ! ' '
A trick ? '
repeated Father Grumbler , who began to understand what had happened .
` Then it must have been those two -- ' ' I warned you not to show them to anybody , ' said the Holy Man .
` You deserve -- but I will give you one more chance . '
And , turning , he unhooked something from the wall .
` When you wish to dust your own jacket or those of your friends , ' he said , ` you have only got to say , `` Flack , flick , switch , be quick , '' and you will see what happens .
That is all I have to tell you . '
And , smiling to himself , the Holy Man pushed Father Grumbler out of the cave .
` Ah , I understand now , ' muttered the good man , as he took the road home ; ` but I think I have got you two rascals ! '
and he hurried on to the tavern with his basket under his arm , and the cock and the switch both inside .
` Good evening , friends ! '
he said , as he entered the inn . '
I am very hungry , and should be glad if you would roast this cock for me as soon as possible .
THIS cock and no other -- mind what I say , ' he went on .
` Oh , and another thing !
You can light the fire with this basket .
When you have done that I will show you something I have in my bag , ' and , as he spoke , he tried to imitate the smile that the Holy Man had given HIM .
These directions made the innkeeper 's wife very uneasy .
However , she said nothing , and began to roast the cock , while her husband did his best to make the man sleepy with wine , but all in vain .
After dinner , which he did not eat without grumbling , for the cock was very tough , the man struck his hand on the table , and said : ` Now listen to me .
Go and fetch my cock and my basket , at once .
Do you hear ? '
` Your cock , and your basket , Father Grumbler ?
But you have just -- ' ` MY cock and MY basket ! '
interrupted he .
` And , if you are too deaf and too stupid to understand what that means , I have got something which may help to teach you . '
And opening the bag , he cried : ` Flack , flick , switch , be quick . '
And flack !
flick !
like lightening a white switch sprang out of the bag , and gave such hearty blows to the innkeeper and his wife , and to Father Grumbler into the bargain , that they all jumped as high as feathers when a mattress is shaken .
` Stop !
stop !
make it stop , and you shall have back your cock and basket , ' cried the man and his wife .
And Father Grumbler , who had no wish to go on , called out between his hops : ` Stop then , ca n't you ?
That is enough for to-day ! '
But the switch paid no attention , and dealt out its blows as before , and MIGHT have been dealing them to this day , if the Holy Man had not heard their cries and come to the rescue .
` Into the bag , quick ! '
said he , and the switch obeyed .
` Now go and fetch me the cock and the basket , ' and the woman went without a word , and placed them on the table .
` You have all got what you deserved , ' continued the Holy Man , ` and I have no pity for any of you .
I shall take my treasures home , and perhaps some day I may find a man who knows how to make the best of the chances that are given to him .
But that will never be YOU , ' he added , turning to Father Grumbler .

The Story of the Yara Down in the south , where the sun shines so hotly that everything and everybody sleeps all day , and even the great forests seem silent , except early in the morning and late in the evening -- down in this country there once lived a young man and a maiden .
The girl had been born in the town , and had scarcely ever left it ; but the young man was a native of another country , and had only come to the city near the great river because he could find no work to do where he was .
A few months after his arrival , when the days were cooler , and the people did not sleep so much as usual , a great feast was held a little way out of the town , and to this feast everyone flocked from thirty miles and more .
Some walked and some rode , some came in beautiful golden coaches ; but all had on splendid dresses of red or blue , while wreaths of flowers rested on their hair .
It was the first time that the youth had been present on such an occasion , and he stood silently aside watching the graceful dances and the pretty games played by the young people .
And as he watched , he noticed one girl , dressed in white with scarlet pomegranates in her hair , who seemed to him lovelier than all the rest .
When the feast was over , and the young man returned home , his manner was so strange that it drew the attention of all his friends .
Through his work next day the youth continued to see the girl 's face , throwing the ball to her companions , or threading her way between them as she danced .
At night sleep fled from him , and after tossing for hours on his bed , he would get up and plunge into a deep pool that lay a little way in the forest .
This state of things went on for some weeks , then at last chance favoured him .
One evening , as he was passing near the house where she lived , he saw her standing with her back to the wall , trying to beat off with her fan the attacks of a savage dog that was leaping at her throat .
Alonzo , for such was his name , sprang forward , and with one blow of his fist stretched the creature dead upon the road .
He then helped the frightened and half-fainting girl into the large cool verandah where her parents were sitting , and from that hour he was a welcome guest in the house , and it was not long before he was the promised husband of Julia .
Every day , when his work was done , he used to go up to the house , half hidden among flowering plants and brilliant creepers , where humming-birds darted from bush to bush , and parrots of all colours , red and green and grey , shrieked in chorus .
There he would find the maiden waiting for him , and they would spend an hour or two under the stars , which looked so large and bright that you felt as if you could almost touch them .
` What did you do last night after you went home ? '
suddenly asked the girl one evening .
` Just the same as I always do , ' answered he .
` It was too hot to sleep , so it was no use going to bed , and I walked straight of to the forest and bathed in one of those deep dark pools at the edge of the river .
I have been there constantly for several months , but last night a strange thing happened .
I was taking my last plunge , when I heard -- sometimes from one side , and sometimes from another -- the sound of a voice singing more sweetly than any nightingale , though I could not catch any words .
I left the pool , and , dressing myself as fast as I could , I searched every bush and tree round the water , as I fancied that perhaps it was my friend who was playing a trick on me , but there was not a creature to be seen ; and when I reached home I found my friend fast asleep . '
As Julia listened her face grew deadly white , and her whole body shivered as if with cold .
From her childhood she had heard stories of the terrible beings that lived in the forests and were hidden under the banks of the rivers , and could only be kept off by powerful charms .
Could the voice which had bewitched Alonzo have come from one of these ?
Perhaps , who knows , it might be the voice of the dreaded Yara herself , who sought young men on the eve of their marriage as her prey .
For a moment the girl sat choked with fear , as these thoughts rushed through her ; then she said : ` Alonzo , will you promise something ? '
` What is that ? '
asked he .
` It is something that has to do with our future happiness . '
` Oh !
it is serious , then ?
Well , of course I promise .
Now tell me ! ' '
I want you to promise , ' she answered , lowering her voice to a whisper , ` never to bathe in those pools again . '
` But why not , queen of my soul ; have I not gone there always , and nothing has harmed me , flower of my heart ? '
` No ; but perhaps something will .
If you will not promise I shall go mad with fright .
Promise me . '
` Why , what is the matter ?
You look so pale !
Tell me why you are so frightened ? '
` Did you not hear the song ? '
she asked , trembling .
` Suppose I did , how could that hurt me ?
It was the loveliest song I ever heard ! '
` Yes , and after the song will come the apparition ; and after that -- after that -- ' ' I do n't understand .
Well -- after that ? '
` After that -- death . '
Alonzo stared at her .
Had she really gone mad ?
Such talk was very unlike Julia ; but before he could collect his senses the girl spoke again : ` That is the reason why I implore you never to go there again ; at any rate till after we are married . '
` And what difference will our marriage make ? '
` Oh , there will be no danger then ; you can go to bathe as often as you like ! '
` But tell me why you are so afraid ? '
` Because the voice you heard -- I know you will laugh , but it is quite true -- it was the voice of the Yara . '
At these words Alonzo burst into a shout of laughter ; but it sounded so harsh and loud that Julia shrank away shuddering .
It seemed as if he could not stop himself , and the more he laughed the paler the poor girl became , murmuring to herself as she watched him : ` Oh , heaven !
you have seen her !
you have seen her !
what shall I do ? '
Faint as was her whisper , it reached the ears of Alonzo , who , though he still could not speak for laughing , shook his head .
` You may not know it , but it is true .
Nobody who has not seen the Yara laughs like that . '
And Julia flung herself on the ground weeping bitterly .
At this sight Alonzo became suddenly grave , and kneeling by her side , gently raised her up .
` Do not cry so , my angel , ' he said , ' I will promise anything you please .
Only let me see you smile again . '
With a great effort Julia checked her sobs , and rose to her feet .
` Thank you , ' she answered .
` My heart grows lighter as you say that !
I know you will try to keep your word and to stay away from the forest .
But -- the power of the Yara is very strong , and the sound of her voice is apt to make men forget everything else in the world .
Oh , I have seen it , and more than one betrothed maiden lives alone , broken-hearted .
If ever you should return to the pool where you first heard the voice , promise me that you will at least take this with you . '
And opening a curiously carved box , she took out a sea-shell shot with many colours , and sang a song softly into it .
` The moment you hear the Yara 's voice , ' said she , ` put this to your ear , and you will hear my song instead .
Perhaps -- I do not know for certain -- but perhaps , I may be stronger than the Yara . '
It was late that night when Alonzo returned home .
The moon was shining on the distant river , which looked cool and inviting , and the trees of the forest seemed to stretch out their arms and beckon him near .
But the young man steadily turned his face in the other direction , and went home to bed .
The struggle had been hard , but Alonzo had his reward next day in the joy and relief with which Julia greeted him .
He assured her that having overcome the temptation once the danger was now over ; but she , knowing better than he did the magic of the Yara 's face and voice , did not fail to make him repeat his promise when he went away .
For three nights Alonzo kept his word , not because he believed in the Yara , for he thought that the tales about her were all nonsense , but because he could not bear the tears with which he knew that Julia would greet him , if he confessed that he had returned to the forest .
But , in spite of this , the song rang in his ears , and daily grew louder .
On the fourth night the attraction of the forest grew so strong that neither the thought of Julia nor the promises he had made her could hold him back .
At eleven o'clock he plunged into the cool darkness of the trees , and took the path that led straight to the river .
Yet , for the first time , he found that Julia 's warnings , though he had laughed at her at the moment , had remained in his memory , and he glanced at the bushes with a certain sense of fear which was quite new to him .
When he reached the river he paused and looked round for a moment to make sure that the strange feeling of some one watching him was fancy , and he was really alone .
But the moon shone brightly on every tree , and nothing was to be seen but his own shadow ; nothing was to be heard but the sound of the rippling stream .
He threw off his clothes , and was just about to dive in headlong , when something -- he did not know what -- suddenly caused him to look round .
At the same instant the moon passed from behind a cloud , and its rays fell on a beautiful golden-haired woman standing half hidden by the ferns .
With one bound he caught up his mantle , and rushed headlong down the path he had come , fearing at each step to feel a hand laid on his shoulder .
It was not till he had left the last trees behind him , and was standing in the open plain , that he dared to look round , and then he thought a figure in white was still standing there waving her arms to and fro .
This was enough ; he ran along the road harder than ever , and never paused till he was save in his own room .
With the earliest rays of dawn he went back to the forest to see whether he could find any traces of the Yara , but though he searched every clump of bushes , and looked up every tree , everything was empty , and the only voices he heard were those of parrots , which are so ugly that they only drive people away . '
I think I must be mad , ' he said to himself , ` and have dreamt all that folly ' ; and going back to the city he began his daily work .
But either that was harder than usual , or he must be ill , for he could not fix his mind upon it , and everybody he came across during the day inquired if anything had happened to give him that white , frightened look . '
I must be feverish , ' he said to himself ; ` after all , it is rather dangerous to take a cold bath when one is feeling so hot . '
Yet he knew , while he said it , that he was counting the hours for night to come , that he might return to the forest .
In the evening he went as usual to the creeper-covered house .
But he had better have stayed away , as his face was so pale and his manner so strange , that the poor girl saw that something terrible had occurred .
Alonzo , however , refused to answer any of her questions , and all she could get was a promise to hear everything the next day .
On pretence of a violent headache , he left Julia much earlier than usual and hurried quickly home .
Taking down a pistol , he loaded it and put it in his belt , and a little before midnight he stole out on the tips of his toes , so as to disturb nobody .
Once outside he hastened down the road which led to the forest .
He did not stop till he had reached the river pool , when holding the pistol in his hand , he looked about him .
At every little noise -- the falling of a leaf , the rustle of an animal in the bushes , the cry of a night-bird -- he sprang up and cocked his pistol in the direction of the sound .
But though the moon still shone he saw nothing , and by and by a kind of dreamy state seemed to steal over him as he leant against a tree .
How long he remained in this condition he could not have told , but suddenly he awoke with a start , on hearing his name uttered softly .
` Who is that ? '
he cried , standing upright instantly ; but only an echo answered him .
Then his eyes grew fascinated with the dark waters of the pool close to his feet , and he looked at it as if he could never look away .
He gazed steadily into the depths for some minutes , when he became aware that down in the darkness was a bright spark , which got rapidly bigger and brighter .
Again that feeling of awful fear took possession of him , and he tried to turn his eyes from the pool .
But it was no use ; something stronger than himself compelled him to keep them there .
At last the waters parted softly , and floating on the surface he saw the beautiful woman whom he had fled from only a few nights before .
He turned to run , but his feet were glued to the spot .
She smiled at him and held out her arms , but as she did so there came over him the remembrance of Julia , as he had seen her a few hours earlier , and her warnings and fears for the very danger in which he now found himself .
Meanwhile the figure was always drawing nearer , nearer ; but , with a violent effort , Alonzo shook off his stupor , and taking aim at her shoulder he pulled the trigger .
The report awoke the sleeping echoes , and was repeated all through the forest , but the figure smiled still , and went on advancing .
Again Alonzo fired , and a second time the bullet whistled through the air , and the figure advanced nearer .
A moment more , and she would be at his side .
Then , his pistol being empty , he grasped the barrel with both hands , and stood ready to use it as a club should the Yara approach and closer .
But now it seemed her turn to feel afraid , for she paused an instant while he pressed forward , still holding the pistol above his head , prepared to strike .
In his excitement he had forgotten the river , and it was not till the cold water touched his feet that he stood still by instinct .
The Yara saw that he was wavering , and suffering herself to sway gently backwards and forwards on the surface of the river , she began to sing .
The song floated through the trees , now far and now near ; no one could tell whence it came , the whole air seemed full of it .
Alonzo felt his senses going and his will failing .
His arms dropped heavily to his side , but in falling struck against the sea shell , which , as he had promised Julia , he had always carried in his coat .
His dimmed mind was just clear enough to remember what she had said , and with trembling fingers , that were almost powerless to grasp , he drew it out .
As he did so the song grew sweeter and more tender than before , but he shut his ears to it and bent his head over the shell .
Out of its depths arose the voice of Julia singing to him as she had sung when she gave him the shell , and though the notes sounded faint at first , they swelled louder and louder till the mist which had gathered about him was blown away .
Then he raised his head , feeling that he had been through strange places , where he could never wander any more ; and he held himself erect and strong , and looked about him .
Nothing was to be seen but the shining of the river , and the dark shadows of the trees ; nothing was to be heard but the hum of the insects , as they darted through the night .

The Cunning Hare In a very cold country , far across the seas , where ice and snow cover the ground for many months in the year , there lived a little hare , who , as his father and mother were both dead , was brought up by his grandmother .
As he was too young , and she was too old , to work , they were very poor , and often did not have enough to eat .
One day , when the little fellow was hungrier than usual , he asked his grandmother if he might go down to the river and catch a fish for their breakfast , as the thaw had come and the water was flowing freely again .
She laughed at him for thinking that any fish would let itself be caught by a hare , especially such a young one ; but as she had the rheumatism very badly , and could get no food herself , she let him go .
` If he does not catch a fish he may find something else , ' she said to herself .
So she told her grandson where to look for the net , and how he was to set it across the river ; but just as he was starting , feeling himself quite a man , she called him back .
` After all , I do n't know what is the use of your going , my boy !
For even if you should catch a fish , I have no fire to cook it with . '
` Let me catch my fish , and I will soon make you a fire , ' he answered gaily , for he was young , and knew nothing about the difficulties of fire-making .
It took him some time to haul the net through bushes and over fields , but at length he reached a pool in the river which he had often heard was swarming with fish , and here he set the net , as his grandmother had directed him .
He was so excited that he hardly slept all night , and at the very first streak of dawn he ran as fast as ever he could down to the river .
His heart beat as quickly as if he had had dogs behind him , and he hardly dared to look , lest he should be disappointed .
Would there be even one fish ?
And at this thought the pangs of hunger made him feel quite sick with fear .
But he need not have been afraid ; in every mesh of the net was a fine fat fish , and of course the net itself was so heavy that he could only lift one corner .
He threw some of the fish back into the water , and buried some more in a hole under a stone , where he would be sure to find them .
Then he rolled up the net with the rest , put it on his back and carried it home .
The weight of the load caused his back to ache , and he was thankful to drop it outside their hut , while he rushed in , full of joy , to tell his grandmother .
` Be quick and clean them ! '
he said , ` and I will go to those people 's tents on the other side of the water . '
The old woman stared at him in horror as she listened to his proposal .
Other people had tried to steal fire before , and few indeed had come back with their lives ; but as , contrary to all her expectations , he had managed to catch such a number of fish , she thought that perhaps there was some magic about him which she did not know of , and did not try to hinder him .
When the fish were all taken out , he fetched the net which he had laid out to dry , folded it up very small , and ran down to the river , hoping that he might find a place narrow enough for him to jump over ; but he soon saw that it was too wide for even the best jumper in the world .
For a few moments he stood there , wondering what was to be done , then there darted into his head some words of a spell which he had once heard a wizard use , while drinking from the river .
He repeated them , as well as he could remember , and waited to see what would happen .
In five minutes such a grunting and a puffing was heard , and columns of water rose into the air , though he could not tell what had made them .
Then round the bend of the stream came fifteen huge whales , which he ordered to place themselves heads to tails , like stepping stones , so that he could jump from one to the other till he landed on the opposite shore .
Directly he got there he told the whales that he did not need them any more , and sat down in the sand to rest .
Unluckily some children who were playing about caught sight of him , and one of them , stealing softly up behind him , laid tight hold of his ears .
The hare , who had been watching the whales as they sailed down the river , gave a violent start , and struggled to get away ; but the boy held on tight , and ran back home , as fast as he could go .
` Throw it in the pot , ' said the old woman , as soon as he had told his story ; ` put it in that basket , and as soon as the water boils in the pot we will hang it over the fire ! '
` Better kill it first , ' said the old man ; and the hare listened , horribly frightened , but still looking secretly to see if there was no hole through which he could escape , if he had a chance of doing so .
Yes , there was one , right in the top of the tent , so , shaking himself , as if with fright , he let the end of his net unroll itself a little . '
I wish that a spark of fire would fall on my net , ' whispered he ; and the next minute a great log fell forward into the midst of the tent , causing every one to spring backwards .
The sparks were scattered in every direction , and one fell on the net , making a little blaze .
In an instant the hare had leaped through the hole , and was racing towards the river , with men , women , and children after him .
There was no time to call back the whales , so , holding the net tight in his mouth , he wished himself across the river .
Then he jumped high into the air , and landed safe on the other side , and after turning round to be sure that there was no chance of anyone pursuing him , trotted happily home to his grandmother .
` Did n't I tell you I would bring you fire ? '
said he , holding up his net , which was now burning briskly .
` But how did you cross the water ? '
inquired the old woman .
` Oh , I just jumped ! '
said he .
And his grandmother asked him no more questions , for she saw that he was wiser than she .

The Turtle and His Bride There was once a turtle who lived among a great many people of different kinds , in a large camp near a big river which was born right up amongst the snows , and flowed straight away south till it reached a sea where the water was always hot .
There were many other turtles in the camp , and this turtle was kind and pleasant to them all , but he did not care for any of them very much , and felt rather lonely .
At last he built himself a hut , and filled it with skins for seats , and made it as comfortable as any hut for miles round ; and when it was quite finished he looked about among the young women to see which of them he should ask to be his wife .
It took him some time to make up his mind , for no turtle likes being hurried , but at length he found one girl who seemed prettier and more industrious than the rest , and one day he entered her home , and said : ` Will you marry me ? '
The young woman was so surprised at this question that she dropped the beaded slipper she was making , and stared at the turtle .
She felt inclined to laugh -- the idea was so absurd ; but she was kind-hearted and polite , so she looked as grave as she could , and answered : ` But how are you going to provide for a family ?
Why , when the camp moves , you will not even be able to keep up with the rest ! ' '
I can keep up with the best of them , ' replied the turtle , tossing his head .
But though he was very much offended he did not let the girl see it , and begged and , prayed her so hard to marry him that , at last , she consented , very unwillingly .
` You will have to wait till the spring , though , ' she said ; ' I must make a great many slippers and dresses for myself , as I shall not have much time afterwards . '
This did not please the turtle ; but he knew it was no use talking , so all he answered was : ' I shall go to war and take some captives , and I shall be away several months .
And when I return I shall expect you to be ready to marry me . '
So he went back to his hut , and at once set about his preparations .
The first thing he did was to call all his relations together , and ask them if they would come with him and make war on the people of a neighbouring village .
The turtles , who were tired of doing nothing , agreed at once , and next day the whole tribe left the camp .
The girl was standing at the door of her hut as they passed , and laughed out loud -- they moved so slowly .
Her lover , who was marching at the head , grew very angry at this , and cried out : ` In four days from now you will be weeping instead of laughing , because there will be hundreds of miles between you and me . '
` In four days , ' replied the girl -- who only promised to marry him in order to get rid of him -- ` in four days you will hardly be out of sight . '
` Oh , I did not mean four days , but four YEARS , ' answered the turtle , hastily ; ` whatever happens I shall be back by then . '
The army marched on , till one day , when they felt as if they must have got half round the earth , though they were scarcely four miles from the camp , they found a large tree lying across their path .
They looked at it with dismay , and the oldest among them put their heads together to see what was to be done .
` Ca n't we manage to get past by the top ? '
asked one .
` Why , it would take us YEARS , ' exclaimed another .
` Just look at all those tall green branches , spreading in every direction .
If once we got entangled in THEM , we should never get out again ! '
` Well then , let us go round by the bottom , ' said a third .
` How are we to do that , when the roots have made a deep hole , and above that is a high bank ? '
replied a fourth .
` No ; the only way I can think of , is to burn a large hole in the trunk . '
And this they did , but the trunk was very thick , and would not burn through .
` It is no use , we must give it up , ' they agreed at last .
` After all , nobody need ever know !
We have been away such a long while that we might easily have had all sorts of adventures . '
And so the whole company turned homewards again .
They took even longer to go back than they had to come , for they were tired and footsore with their journey .
When they drew near the camp they plucked up their courage , and began to sing a war-song .
At this the villagers came flocking to see what spoils the turtles had won , but , as they approached , each turtle seized some one by the wrist , exclaiming : ` You are our spoils ; you are our prisoners ! '
` Now that I have got you I will keep you , ' said the leader , who had happened to seize his betrothed .
Everybody was naturally very angry at this behaviour , and the girl most of all , and in her secret heart she determined to have her revenge .
But , just at present , the turtles were too strong , so the prisoners had to put on their smartest slippers and their brightest clothes , and dance a war dance while the turtles sang .
They danced so long that it seemed as if they would never stop , till the turtle who was leading the singing suddenly broke into a loud chant : Whoever comes here , will die , will die !
At this all the dancers grew so frightened that they burst through the ring of their captors , and ran back to the village , the turtles following -- very slowly .
On the way the chief turtle met a man , who said to him : ` That woman who was to have been your wife has married another man ! '
` Is that true ? '
said the turtle .
` Then I must see him . '
But as soon as the villager was out of sight the turtle stopped , and taking a bundle containing fringes and ornaments from his back , he hung them about him , so that they rattled as he walked .
When he was quite close to the hut where the woman lived , he cried out : ` Here I am to claim the woman who promised to be my wife . '
` Oh , here is the turtle , ' whispered the husband hurriedly ; ` what is to be done now ? '
` Leave that to me ; I will manage him , ' replied the wife , and at that moment the turtle came in , and seized her by the wrist .
` Come with me , ' he said sternly .
` You broke your promise , ' answered she .
` You said you would be back soon , and it is more than a year since you went !
How was I to know that you were alive ? '
At her words the husband took courage , and spoke hastily : ` Yes , you promised you would go to war and bring back some prisoners , and you have not done it . ' '
I DID go , and made many prisoners , ' retorted the turtle angrily , drawing out his knife .
` Look here , if she wo n't be MY wife , she sha 'n' t be YOURS .
I will cut her in two ; and you shall have one half , and I the other . '
` But half a woman is no use to me , ' answered the man .
` If you want her so much you had better take her . '
And the turtle , followed by his relations , carried her off to his own hut .
Now the woman saw she would gain nothing by being sulky , so she pretended to be very glad to have got rid of her husband ; but all the while she was trying to invent a plan to deliver herself from the turtle .
At length she remembered that one of her friends had a large iron pot , and when the turtle had gone to his room to put away his fringes , she ran over to her neighbour 's and brought it back .
Then she filled it with water and hung it over the fire to boil .
It was just beginning to bubble and hiss when the turtle entered .
` What are you doing there ? '
asked he , for he was always afraid of things that he did not understand .
` Just warming some water , ' she answered .
` Do you know how to swim ? '
` Yes , of course I do .
What a question !
But what does it matter to you ? '
said the turtle , more suspicious than ever .
` Oh , I only thought that after your long journey you might like to wash .
The roads are so muddy , after the winter 's rains .
I could rub your shell for you till it was bright and shining again .
` Well , I AM rather muddy .
If one is fighting , you know , one can not stop to pick one 's way .
I should certainly be more comfortable if my back was washed . '
The woman did not wait for him to change his mind .
She caught him up by his shell and popped him straight into the pot , where he sank to the bottom , and died instantly .
The other turtles , who were standing at the door , saw their leader disappear , and felt it was their duty as soldiers to follow him ; and , springing into the pot , died too .
All but one young turtle , who , frightened at not seeing any of his friends come out again , went as fast as he could to a clump of bushes , and from there made his way to the river .
His only thought was to get away as far as possible from that dreadful hut ; so he let the river carry him where it was going itself , and at last , one day , he found himself in the warm sea , where , if he is not dead , you may meet him still .

How Geirald The Coward Was Punished Once upon a time there lived a poor knight who had a great many children , and found it very hard to get enough for them to eat .
One day he sent his eldest son , Rosald , a brave and honest youth , to the neighbouring town to do some business , and here Rosald met a young man named Geirald , with whom he made friends .
Now Geirald was the son of a rich man , who was proud of the boy , and had all his life allowed him to do whatever he fancied , and , luckily for the father , he was prudent and sensible , and did not waste money , as many other rich young men might have done .
For some time he had set his heart on travelling into foreign countries , and after he had been talking for a little while to Rosald , he asked if his new friend would be his companion on his journey .
` There is nothing I should like better , ' answered Rosald , shaking his head sorrowfully ; ` but my father is very poor , and he could never give me the money . '
` Oh , if that is your only difficulty , it is all right , ' cried Geirald .
` My father has more money than he knows what to do with , and he will give me as much as I want for both of us ; only , there is one thing you must promise me , Rosald , that , supposing we have any adventures , you will let the honour and glory of them fall to me . '
` Yes , of course , that is only fair , ' answered Rosald , who never cared about putting himself forward .
` But I can not go without telling my parents .
I am sure they will think me lucky to get such a chance . '
As soon as the business was finished , Rosald hastened home .
His parents were delighted to hear of his good fortune , and his father gave him his own sword , which was growing rusty for want of use , while his mother saw that his leather jerkin was in order .
` Be sure you keep the promise you made to Geirald , ' said she , as she bade him good-bye , ` and , come what may , see that you never betray him . '
Full of joy Rosald rode off , and the next day he and Geirald started off to seek adventures .
To their disappointment their own land was so well governed that nothing out of the common was very likely to happen , but directly they crossed the border into another kingdom all seemed lawlessness and confusion .
They had not gone very far , when , riding across a mountain , they caught a glimpse of several armed men hiding amongst some trees in their path , and remembered suddenly some talk they had heard of a band of twelve robbers who lay in wait for rich travellers .
The robbers were more like savage beasts than men , and lived somewhere at the top of the mountain in caves and holes in the ground .
They were all called ` Hankur , ' and were distinguished one from another by the name of a colour -- blue , grey , red , and so on , except their chief , who was known as Hankur the Tall .
All this and more rushed into the minds of the two young men as they saw the flash of their swords in the moonlight .
` It is impossible to fight them -- they are twelve to two , ' whispered Geirald , stopping his horse in the path .
` We had much better ride back and take the lower road .
It would be stupid to throw away our lives like this . '
` Oh , we ca n't turn back , ' answered Rosald , ` we should be ashamed to look anyone in the face again !
And , besides , it is a grand opportunity to show what we are made of .
Let us tie up our horses here , and climb up the rocks so that we can roll stones down on them . '
` Well , we might try that , and then we shall always have our horses , ' said Geirald .
So they went up the rocks silently and carefully .
The robbers were lying all ready , expecting every moment to see their victims coming round the corner a few yards away , when a shower of huge stones fell on their heads , killing half the band .
The others sprang up the rock , but as they reached the top the sword of Rosald swung round , and one man after another rolled down into the valley .
At last the chief managed to spring up , and , grasping Rosald by the waist , flung away his sword , and the two fought desperately , their bodies swaying always nearer the edge .
It seemed as if Rosald , being the smaller of the two , MUST fall over , when , with his left hand , he drew the robber 's sword out of its sheath and plunged it into his heart .
Then he took from the dead man a beautiful ring set with a large stone , and put it on his own finger .
The fame of this wonderful deed soon spread through the country , and people would often stop Geirald 's horse , and ask leave to see the robber 's ring , which was said to have been stolen from the father of the reigning king .
And Geirald showed them the ring with pride , and listened to their words of praise , and no one would ever have guessed anyone else had destroyed the robbers .

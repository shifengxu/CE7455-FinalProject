DAVID MAG/L 

Such a disorderly young 
lady! How come she was 
working for law and order? 

I ’M A cop. Nothing surprises me. 

A cop gets to see it all — too 
much of it and too much of it bad. 
The worst is death when a kid buys 
it. The toughest thing of all is hav- 
ing to look down at the body of a 
once breathtakingly beautiful 
young girl. 

I’m a detective. The name’s 
Mike Winsor. I was looking down 
at the body as the M.E. was getting 
set to do his onceover. She’d been a 
beauty. Age was a little tough. It 
wasn’t more than seventeen by that 
good young body- the face looked 
even younger. 

Story was simple. For some rea- 
son she’d been damn fool enough 
to try to cut across Central Park at 
night. Somebody jumped her and 
then used the knife. That much was 
easy. 

I tore my eyes away from her. 
Doc had peeled back the shroud 
and it was hard to look away. Best 




legs I’d ever seen and everything 
else she had was that good. Some 
guys in the department were going 
to save her pictures as memorabilia 
of waste or for other reasons. But 
they weren’t my problem. 

I had her purse. It had been 
found right beside her. It was new. 
Inside there were no cosmetics, not 
even a comb — yet, even after she 
had been jumped and killed, her 
hair was done neatly. 

“That a wig?’’ I asked the Doc. 

“Nope. That’s all her.’’ 

No handkerchief in the purse. 
No change. One ten-dollar bill, 
new, crisp. And there were three 
buttons. They looked like buttons. 
I picked them out and looked at 
them. They didn’t have holes in 
them. So they weren’t buttons. 
Some kind of metallic substance, 
but what they were and what they 
were made of was a lab problem. 

So that was it. Unless a miracle 
happened it was going to be one 
more unsolved murder. If she was a 
runaway or something I wondered 
whether we’d even find out who she 
was. But she had that body and 
that face. We might get lucky, I 
thought. She was worth acknowl- 
edging. 

“Hey, Mike. A key. Hotel 
Mercury.’’ 

“Hers?” 

“Could be,’’ my partner said. 
“Looks clean. Couldn’t have been 
out here too long. If she had it in 
her hand when they got her, 
maybe — ’’ 



“Okay. Doc? Anything?’’ 

He looked up at me, his eyes 
slitted, brow furrow. “Body tem- 
perature’s all wrong. It’s normal 
or damn close to it.” 

“She’s dead?” 

“Look at that wound. She 
Wed — the blood’s coagulated. 
There’s no way her temperature 
can be normal. Here, feel here. 
And look at this.” He pulled up the 
torn skirt even further. 

“So?” 

“Raise your eyes, boy.” 

“Belly button?” 

“That’s right. A perfect 
rectangle.” 

“What’s it mean? Anything? She 
a Martian?” 

“Yeah. Ha-ha. I don’t know 
what it means. No pulse. No other 
irregularities. But give me a call in 
about four hours. I’m going to give 
this young lady a complete 
physicial.” 



I CHECKED out the body and 
left the rest of the work with my 
partner. Then I drove over to the 
Mercury. It was the new ho- 
tel — expensive, a handsome place. 
I showed my shield, showed the 
key, described the body. No prob- 
lem there. “Mary or Alice Smith.” 
Both knockouts, my description 
could fit either one. They’d been in 
a week. Registration form showed 
no prior address. Unusual, a viola- 
tion of NYCPLH679331 — ninety 
days, fifteen-hundred-dollar fine,

and a license renewal problem. 

1 rorgot it. 

I rode up and knocked on the 
door. No answer. I used the dead 
girl’s key. It was the agreement. I 
forgot their violation — they forgot 
their houseman was supposed to go 
in with me. 

The room was empty. Two suit- 
cases, nothing in them. Closet 
empty. Dresser empty. Nothing in 
the bathroom. Bathtub not wet. 
Bed not slept in. The Gideon out on 
the bedside table, marker in at 
Isaiah. Marked passage: Chapter 
forty-one, verse twenty-four: Be- 
hold » ye are nothing. And your 
work a thing of nought; An abomi- 
nation is he that chooseth you. 

What did that mean? 

I went back down and asked 
there. The sister, apparently— the 
surviving one — had gone out at 
seven. She always went out at sev- 
en. She always came back at noon. 
They didn’t think she’d skipped. 

I asked them to give me a call 
and then I went over to the morgue. 
Doc was having a time. Our 
girl was still maintaining her nor- 
mal temperature — she was at 98.6 
and holding. She had no molars, no 
cavities. Teeth looked new, no 
wear. She had no appendix, which 
wasn’t that unusual. What was dis- 
tressing was she seemed to be lack- 
ing some sexual equipment and ac- 
cording to X-ray, she had multiple- 
chamber lungs and a unichamber 
heart. Blood was so far unclassi- 
fiable. 



“I don’t know what we have 
here,” Doc told me. It bothered 
him. He didn’t like mysteries. 

I went back to the bureau and 
did my part of the report and then I 
put in some time on a grocery store 
killing. That was going to get into 
the the unsolved files, too. 

But at noon I was back at the 
Mercury, knocking on that hotel 
room door again. 

S HE wasn’t more beautiful than, 
the dead one, but she wasn’t 
one bit less. I showed her my 
shield. She looked at it, confused, 
as if not knowing what it meant. 
But she smiled at me and let me in. 

I asked her name. 

“Andridida.” 

44 Want to spell that?” 

‘‘Alice, I mean,” she said. “It is 
Alice Smith.” 

“Where you from, Alice?” 
“Uh— ” 

“Who were you here with? Was 
it your sister?” 

“No, Tinna is . I mean 
Mary is just a friend.” 

“Your friend and you have the 
same name — and you’re not even 
sure what your name is? You don’t 
know where you come from. You 
runaways?” 

“Please. I’m sorry. I do not 
know a great deal. I’m here to 
learn. Would it be possible for you 
to’ explain whatever situation this 
may be?” 

I looked at her. You run into a 
lot of crazies. She didn’t look like 



92 



IF 




she was on anything. She was a 
great-looking girl. “Okay. You 
want to sit down?” 

“If you wish that of me,” she 
said and stretched out on the bed. 

“I said ‘sit,’ I’m on official busi- 
ness, girl.” 

“Oh? You mean in this 
position?” 

“Right. I’m a police detective. 
I’m here on business. I hate having 
to break it to you, but early this 
morning we found your friend in 
the park. She’d been attacked. Af- 
ter they finished with her they 
killed her.” 

“Oh.” 

“Oh? That’s all you have to 
say?” 

“I’m not facile with the lan- 
guage. Attacked? What does this 
mean?” 

“Violated, sexually violated. A 
man or men jumped her.” 

“Oh! And she wasn’t willing?” 
“We don’t know that, but the as- 
sumption is she wasn’t or they 
thought she wasn’t.” 

She seemed to be weighing that. 
“And what does ’killed’ mean?” 
“You’re kidding. It means depri- 
vation of life without the victim’s 
volition. She’s dead.” 

“Oh! Why didn’t you say that? 
Where is she? Please. Take me 
there. I have to see her. 

I figured about then she was a 
crazy, but that wasn’t illegal. 

I tried to prepare her on the ride. 
I tried to get across to her that her 
friend or whatever the dead girl 



had been to her wasn’t all that 
pretty to look at any more. She 
didn’t seem aware of what I was 
saying, didn’t seem to give a damn. 
She looked out through the car 
windows like a tourist on vacation 
in Fun City as we drove through 
the traffic. 

They hadn’t done the autopsy, 
just the preliminary report was in. 
Because of the irregularities Doc 
wanted some experts around for 
the carving. So the dead 
girl — Mary, call her — was in the 
drawer. Old Jinx, grouchy as ever, 
rolled it open for us. 

“Now just take it easy, huh,” I 
told Alice. 

I pulled the sheet down just 
enough so the face was clear, not 
the throat. 

“Hi,” Alice said to the body. 

T raised an eyebrow. Doc had 
come in with a couple of other 
people. It wasn’t often we had 
someone who looked like Mary on 
a slab or someone who looked like 
Alice visiting. 

“Alice. Is that your friend 
Mary?” I asked her. 

Alice went and just took the 
sheet out of my hand and pulled it 
down to the dead girl’s ankles. 
That rectangular navel stood out 
and hit you. She put her hand on 
the dead girl’s breast— a well made 
one — and then, frowning, reached 
up and touched the ripped neck. 

She said: “You dummy! Didn’t I 
tell you that you had to be care- 
ful?” Then, to me: “Did she violate

93 




some custom or hurt anything in 
your primitive society?” 

I didn’t believe it. 

“Oh, well.” She sighed. She 
opened her shoulder bag, got out a 
button just like the buttons I’d 
found on the dead girl. She shoved 
one button into the dead girl’s 
navel. 

I SAW it. Jinx saw it. Doc and the 
others saw part of it. The dead 
girl’s throat clamped together — it 
actually moved and then it healed. 
In ten seconds that throat was un- 
cut. Fifteen seconds and the girl sat 
up, shook her head, said: “Hi — ” 
to Alice and climbed right off that 
slab. 

“What were you up to, Tinna? 
You know how much trouble this is 
gonna cause.” 

“It was only a little mistake.” 
“Well, you apologize to these 
people and then you’re going to 
have to go right home,” 

I was bugeyed. I didn’t believe it. 
“Do I have to? Oh, come on, An- 
dridida. It’s wasn’t my fault. I just 
made a little mistake.” 

“You violated the rules and 
that’s the one thing you know 
you’re not allowed to do. Now you 
apologize to these people and we’ll 
just take you back and send you on 
home. When you grow up and are 
ready to behave responsibly maybe 
you can come back again. All 
right?” 

“I don’t want to go. I like it 
here.” 



“What. What happened last 
night?” I heard myself ask. I was 
talking to a dead girl — it occurred 
to me that she was a stiff. 

“Oh, hi,” she said to me. Big 
smile. “I don’t know, I was walk- 
ing through that nice area and sud- 
denly one of your people — ” 
“Took a fancy to you,” Alice 
whispered. 

“Took a fancy to me,” the dead 
girl informed me. 

“Took a fancy to you, did he? 
Did you see this person?” 

“Oh, it was really four persons, I 
think.” 

“You think. What did they look 
like?” 

“I can’t say, you know.” 

“You didn’t see their faces?” 
“Oh, I saw them. They were 
funny. All red-faced and real 
funny-looking. But I can’t tell you 
exactly. All of you look just alike 
to me.” 

“All of us look alike to you? 
Were they tall or short, white, 
black, Chinese, Puerto Rican?” 
“I’m very sorry, sir. But you see, 
I don’t know those things. They all 
looked the same to me, very 
funny.” 

“Funny. You didn’t happen to 
see which one cut your throat?” 
“Yes. I saw him, of course. But I 
couldn’t describe him or anything. 
He just looked likevyou.” 

“Like me?” 

“Or like him or those men. You 
ancients all look the same to me.” 
“Ancients.”

IF 




“We’re very sorry, sir. And we 
promise it won’t ever happen 
again. If we hurt anything or 
caused some irreparable damage to 
the fabric of your society you just 
tell me and I’ll see that it’s 
fixed — rectified — and just as good 
as newness,” Alice told me. “Now 
you, dummy. You come on. And 
when you get back you’d better not 
lie. You tell exactly what hap- 
pened. You know the damage you 
could wreak with something like 
this. Now, come on — right this 
minute!” 

Alice took the dead girl’s arm 
and the two of them just walked 
out. As an aside, the no longer 
dead girl was stark naked. 

I’m supposed to think 
quickly — I get paid for it — but I 
just stood aside and Jinx did and 
Doc did and the others did. 

It took me a full minute before I 
realized that the slab was empty 
and the dead girl was gone. 

I ran. 

The city can be pretty damned 
blase, but there were enough signs. 
There were two wrecked cars down 
at the corner. People were out and 
arguing in front of a grocery store. 
When I got to them they were yell- 
ing at each other about whether 
they’d just seen a stark naked 
beauty being hauled by her ear by 
another girl who was the equal of 
the naked one. 

I ran on, chased around, bumped 
into Blind Charlie. He’d seen 
them — he was only blind during 



working hours. He was on his 
lunch break. 

I raced on, tracked the girls 
across town, ignored the policing 
that should have been done in their 
wake. I almost cornered them as 
they headed into the park. Missed 
them by seconds. What happened 
to them then I have no idea. 

T HREE weeks later, about three 
o’clock in the morning, the 
buzzer went off. I’d just finished 
forty-eight hours straight of trying 
to save a kidnaped kid — I hadn’t. I 
crawled out of bed, got into my 
pants and dragged myself to the 
door. 

“Hi,” she said. 

She was wearing a see-through 
blouse and not much of a skirt and 
she had a deep tan all over. If she’d 
come to me to report getting raped 
in that getup I would have slapped 
her in jail for provocation. It was 
Alice. (I just thought — the only 
place the name was spoken was in 
my head.) 

“No,” she said. “My real name 
is Andridida. I’m sorry. You see, I 
made a mistake and they sent me 
back to rectify it. You were chosen 
as witness to the rectification.” 
“Yeah? What happened?” 

“Oh, she’s fine. You know. It 
was just that she was a dummy. 
Oh, you mean when you followed 
us? Well, we went to our place and 
then went home.” 

“You’d better come in. Where’s 
home?”

“It’s in the future and it’s on a 
distant planet. But we are de- 
scended from Earth Explorers, you 
know.’’ 

“How far in the future?’’ 

“Seven thousand three hundred 
and thirty-nine Earth years. But 
that’s not accurate — exactly — be- 
cause Earth changed about five 
thousand years ago or two thou- 
sand years from now. It’s a little 
confusing.” 

She looked around my ultra- 
modern apartment, a real futuristic 
place. 

“Quaint,” she told me. 

“How did you get Mary, Tinna 
whatever her name to heal that 
way?” 

“That’s the sort of thing I’m not 
supposed to tell you. Boy, did they 
ever give me hell. Tinna was always 
a dum-dum and they said they 
couldn’t really expect much more 
from her, but what happened was 
my fault and so they sent me back 
to rectify and not cause any more 
trouble. Okay?” 

“What are you going to rectify?” 

“Well, those boys who took the 
fancy to Tinna. They can’t be. 
Anachronism is okay but bad ones 
simply aren’t acceptable. So we 
have to attend to them.” 

“We have to attend to them? 
How? You know how many young 
punks are floating around this city 
and how many older ones? Did 
your friend give you any 
description?” 

“No. She’s a dummy. She really 



thinks you all look the same. But 
there’s a way. Here. I have a list.” 
She opened her purse and gave 
me a fifty-page notebook. Every bit 
and piece of paper front and back 
was covered with tiny writing. She 
spelled badly. The way I saw it, 
most of the terms applied to 
electrical equipment. 

“If this wasn’t such a mess now I 
think I’d just go out and steal 
it — but, boy, would they ever give 
me hell if I did that and got caught 
or something. So, I’ve just been 
and I priced all the things I could 
find and in your money I need al- 
most exactly ten million dollars. 
So, if you’ll just give it to me I’ll 
rectify this and then everything will 
be all right again.” 

“Ten million dollars?” 

“Yes. Is that a lot?” 

“Well, it’s more than I have.” 
“Oh. I was certain you’d have 
it.” 

“’Fraid not. Sorry.” 

“Well. We can’t do it without 
the apparatus, you know.” 

“Couldn’t you make it for a hun- 
dred and twenty-five dollars? I 
have that.” 

“No. Ten million is the amount I 
need. Wait. Let me think for a 
minute.” 

She stood there, beautiful, 
maybe more beautiful with that 
puzzled, pensive^ little-girl look. 
And then she just dematerialized. 
She was there, right in front of me, 
and then she wasn’t there any 
more.

IF 




T HREE weeks after that I was 
collaring a pusher down on a 
Hundred and Forty-second. The 
pusher’s neighbors didn’t like him 
but liked me less. There were circl- 
ing and closing in on me. Their 
faces weren’t angry — they were 
stolid. They didn’t even have to 
whip up their feelings about getting 
me. They knew they had me. And I 
knew the only way I’d get out was 
shoot my way out. With the politi- 
cians and the department scared to 
death of the newspapers and every- 
one else, I had a choice of being 
stomped to death right out of the 
department or shooting my way 
out and getting heaved out of the 
job for that. 

Me and my pusher were in the 
center of the ring. I didn’t see any 
way out. They didn’t care if I got 
some of them. I was a cop and they 
hated cops. 

“Hi.” 

She was there with me. Where 
she came from, I don’t know. “I 
can do it for a hundred and twenty- 
five dollars. Will you give it to me 
now, please?” 

“These citizens want to kill me,” 
I explained. 

“Oh?” She turned and smiled at 
them all, “I don’t think you should 
kill Mike. It’s not nice. Now all of 
you go home.” 

They didn’t believe it. There was 
this gorgeous piece of meat, almost 
all of it on view — this kid, this 
piece of fluff. And she was telling 
them. 



She shook her finger at them. 
“You go home right away or I’m 
going to get good and mad,” she 
told them. They didn’t even know 
what the hell she was talking about. 
She turned to me as if they were 
taken care of already. “Do you 
have the money? The sooner you 
give it to me the faster this is going 
to get done.” 

I watched them. She had magic 
buttons. If they got me I didn’t 
have anything but health insurance. 

“Don’t worry about these 
people. They’re all going home. 
Now!” She clapped her hands. A 
whole gang of them had been grim, 
mean, bent on bending me, but 
suddenly every face there took on 
an idiotic grin. They were smiling. 
Some of them — probably for .the 
first time in their lives when not 
turned on— giggled. Like jolly 
zombies they turned and walked 
away. 

“You see? You have to trust me. 
Now. The money. Please.” 

I tried breathing again. I was 
still alive. That was when a patrol 
car idled up. They had probably 
been sleeping it off in some al- 
ley — great police force we have. I 
turned my pusher over to them and 
then I took Andridida’s arm — it 
was very warm and the skin was 
baby soft. We got into my car and I 
didn’t even question her. I just 
drove us to the bank, told her to 
wait, walked in and emptied my ac- 
count, brought out the money and 
gave it to her.

“Oh, good. Now, please. You 
have to tell me where I can find 
a — ” she stopped and seemed to 
think about it — “bookie joint and 
then a crap game and do they have 
roulette?” 

That was what she wanted to 
know. I told her. East Side Eddie 
ran a floating crap game. She could 
find him either in the furnace room 
of P.S. 147 or behind the 16th Pre- 
cinct, in a garage there. Loose-lip- 
ped Louis was the bookie. He ran a 
candy store on 86th Street. As far 
as roulette, there was a casino over 
in Fort Lee. 

“Okay,” she said, accepting. 
“And please don’t worry. I know I 
made a mistake, but I promise I’ll 
rectify it.” 

“Yeah,” I said. 

She didn’t vanish. She just got 
out of the car and walked away. 

But I didn’t Jose her. 

T HE reports came in and I saw 
them. 

East Side Eddie and all his 
friends were flat busted. All they 
remembered was that, even switch- 
ing dice, they couldn’t stop her. 
She came in, asked them how to 
play the game and then she rolled 
whatever they told her would win. 
According to East Side Eddie, who 
was found weeping in a bar over on 
Third Avenue by a gambling squad 
detective, they switched her onto 
dice that were so loaded the aver- 
age guy wasn’t strong enough to 
pick them up. 



The next report was on Loose- 
lipped Louis. They found him in an 
alley. He’d been worked over and 
worked over hard. He kept mum- 
bling, “Please, girlie. Please, 
girlie.” 

She’d come in and put her win- 
nings on the least likely pair of 
nags in the history of flat racing. 
The horses were so old and feeble 
they weren’t even allowed on a de- 
cent track. Neither one of them 
had ever finished better than last 
and twenty furlongs behind the 
pack. Glue factories and ice 
wagons used better. But there was 
a quote on them and Andridida 
walked in, put her ten thousand 
dollars on them (presumably the 
money gained from East Side Ed- 
die and his pals) and they paid 408 
to one. That should have given her 
four million and eighty thousand 
dollars. Loose-lipped Louis — a 
grade-school dropout — could not 
even imagine such a sum. He of- 
fered to give her back her money 
and invited her to come up to his 
place to see his Danish picture 
books. Andridida had a fit. She 
took him out in the alley-and man- 
handled — really strong-armed him. 
Then she escorted him around 
town to collect. The best he could 
come up with was ten per cent. She 
took the four hundred thou but 
parted with Loose-lipped in an al- 
ley where she finished her ex- 
pression of unhappiness with wel- 
chers. Knocked his teeth out, every 
one.

IF 




It wasn’t a surprise. I heard the 
story and decided to keep the radio 
on. Presently the story came over 
the' speaker: “Unidentified, beau- 
tiful young girl machine-gunned by 
gangsters. ’’ She had been walk- 
ing down 16th Street and a dark 
limousine had cruised up. A sub- 
machine gun had spoken and the 
bullets had cut her down. 

I drove like crazy to get there. 
The whole machinery of the law 
was there: the squad, the ambu- 
lance, the medical examiners, the 
witnesses, the crowd. I held my 
shield out front and just walked 
through. Those bullets had really 
gotten her. She was as riddled as 
any shooting victim I’d ever seen. I 
just elbowed through to her. The 
precinct captain was there. He 
wasn’t my friend. He asked what 
the hell I was doing on his turf. 

I told him to just take it easy. 
“It’s a special case. She’s a friend.’’ 
“Oh,” he said, pretending to 
have a human concern. “Sorry 
about it, Mike.’’ 

“Don’t worry, huh? Her purse 
around?'’ 

“Yeah. Why?’’ 

“Let me see it for a minute, will 
you?’’ 

He got a detective to fetch it for 
me. It was new, almost empty — but 
there were those buttons. I pulled 
one out. 

“What are you doing?’’ 

I knelt beside her and peeled 
back the shroud. If she’d worn any 
more clothes I couldn’t have gotten 



to it, but before they grabbed me 
and hauled me back I crammed the 
thing into her navel. 

It didn’t take more than thirty 
seconds — and half her head had 
been blown away, too. She regrew 
the half of head while the cops 
stopped holding me to watch. Then 
she sat up, blinked those big eyes of 
hers, smiled that smile she had and 
said. “Hi.’’ 

They were all speechless. They 
also seemed paralyzed. I just left 
her there and them with her and 
walked away from it. 

T RICKS again. By the time I 
got to my car, she was already 
in it. “You know,’’ she told me. “I 
think Mr. Loose-lipped Louis did 
that. It wasn’t at all nice.’’ 
“Yeah,’’ I said. 

“I’ll fix him,’’ she informed me. 
“Yeah,’’ I said. (As it worked 
out, she did fix him. Guys who’d 
never beat him suddenly couldn’t 
miss. He turned loser, finally 
Found God or at least sanctuary in 
some monastic order. So because 
of her a monastery has a Brother 
Loose-lipped Louis.) 

“Come on. I have almost a half a 
million and I only need nine and a 
half million more.’’ 

“Uh-huh.’’ 

She insisted and I wasn’t going 
to cross her. 

The casino in Fort Lee was shim- 
mering and very fancy, a fugitive 
piece of ersatz gingerbread and tin- 
kley tinsel from the old days. I ex-

plained the game to her and as 
soon as she had it she decided to 
ask that the limit be raised. She 
wanted to get it on two spins. The 
manager didn’t trust even his rig- 
ged wheel that much. He let her bet 
a thousand at a spin. She liked nine 
black. And, not surprising me, that 
little ball couldn’t resist it. Nine 
black came up ten times running 
and that was it. That was all the 
money they had. 

She had a tantrum, called them 
cheats and bad sports and was just 
working her way into turning them 
into frogs or something when I de- 
cided it was wiser to haul her out. 

So she went on with the tantrum 
at me. She was still short of her 
first million. Didn’t I want the rec- 
tification? Didn’t I have any inter- 
est in it? Didn’t I want to help her? 
Wasn’t I her friend? 

“Now, look. You’ve taken less 
than twelve hours. You’ve ruined 
the biggest floating crap game in 
this city. You busted and beat up 
our most important bookie. You 
wiped out this casino and you got 
killed once. That’s plenty for one 
day.” 

“But I have to get the money. I 
can’t do it without money. How am 
I going to get the money?” 

“Find an oil field or uranium 
mine or something.” 

“Are those things worth 
anything?” 

“They’re worth something.” 
“How? I mean, where should I 
find them?” 



“Well, it would be best if you 
owned the land. Find the oil or the 
uranium or gold if you want, buy 
the land and then sell it.” 

“Should I find it in any special 
place?” 

“Probably someplace where the 
land is cheap and not too 
developed.” 

“Where is the land cheap?” 

“Deserts, maybe remote 
mountains.” 

“I should find a lot of this oil or 
uranium or gold?” 

“A lot would be better.” 

“Okay. Thank you, Mike. I 
really do appreciate your help, you 
know,” she told me and off she 
went. 

The story didn’t make the pa- 
pers in the morning and didn’t 
even get into the evening papers. 
But the next morning’s headlines 
announced: largest mineral de- 
posits IN NORTH AMERICA. The 
early reports were, of course, 
typically inaccurate. The evening 
paper set it straight: largest min- 
eral DEPOSITS ON EARTH DISCOV- 
ERED. 

Interestingly, she was a cheap- 
skate. She had found the cheapest 
land in the country and then she 
bought hardly any of it. And the 
stuff was arranged like pipelines 
right down to the core. One pipe 
was oil, one natural gas, one ura- 
nium, one gold, one silver, one cop- 
per and more. 

She got her ten million and then 
some.

IF 




I HAVE a one-bedroom apart- 
ment in an old building. The 
movers had had trouble bringing 
my ninety-inch sofa up on the 
freight elevator and the floor’s so 
ancient it isn’t sturdy enough for a 
waterbed. 

They had put Andridida’s gadget 
on a great flatbed truck — a gadget 
maybe the size of a small house. It 
had taken a couple of giant cranes 
and two teams of loaders. And then 
with an escort they somehow got it 
across town and to my freight en- 
trance. There they checked the ad- 
dress again and started cursing and 
swearing and yelling. That was 
when little Andridida walked up. 
She touched the monster gadget, 
waited for it to reduce itself in 
size, then picked it up with one 
hand and carried it up to my place. 

Ten million dollars’ worth of 
that game went on. Even after all 
the paraphernalia had been shrunk 
to little and very little I could 
barely squeeze into my place after 
a while. But all the deliveries were 
finally made and she clapped her 
hands, satisfied. But her happiness 
lasted only five minutes. She 
turned morose. I asked her what 
the problem was. She needed a 
screwdriver. 

What I produced wasn’t what 
she wanted but she decided it would 
have to do. I offered to help but 
wasn’t much help. The two of us 
sat on the floor and I watched 
while she worked. I had no idea 
what the devil she was making, but 



when it was finished it was about a 
six feet square. She talked to it or 
did something to it and it dutifully 
shriveled up and came down to 
about the size of a cassette 
recorder. 

That pleased her. She was 
happy. She smiled at me. 

So we took her ten-million-dol- 
lar toy and went to the park to the 
bushes where we’d found Mary or 
Tinna or whatever the other girl’s 
name. We sat there cross-legged 
and she flipped on her machine. 

I screamed. There was a Bronto- 
saurus standing on my foot. She 
said, “Sorry,” and the Bronto- 
saurus went away. She made some 
sort of adjustment. I kept myself 
from yelling, but I drew my service 
revolver. We were surrounded by 
these four slope-headed hairy guys 
bearing animal skins with clubs in 
their hands. They went away. It 
was a long process. We were under 
water twice — once we were con- 
fronted by a sharklike creature. 
Later a gang of Indians came after 
us. It was just one thing after an- 
other. Happily, she turned off most 
of the things pretty quick. But she 
was a voyeur or whatever the fe- 
male equivalent and from the first 
slopehead with his girl, through the 
Indian bucks and maids, through 
Nieuw Amsterdam’s guys and 
girls, through the British couples, 
the Colonial ones, the guys and 
dolls. Well, for the first time 
in my life I wondered whether the 
place really wasn’t Fun City. That 



SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL POLICE 



101 




copse of bushes had to be the sex 
capital of the world and Andridida 
just loved it. I was a little embar- 
rassed by it, myself. 

Finally, after a hell of a long 
time, along came Tinna or Mary or 
whatever her name. 

“Ah-ha,” Andridida said and we 
watched the shocking rape murder 
in perfect focus and detail. 

W HEN the act was over and the 
punks ran off we followed 
them — somehow. Andridida car- 
ried the machine and we just 
traipsed after the guys, I guess. It 
was a little confusing because it 
wasn’t really then but it was now 
and so — going into the IRT, for ex- 
ample — we occupied real space but 
the four punks were just walking 
right through people. 

We subwayed after them and 
then followed the punks up the 
steps and out into what hadn’t been 
a good neighborhood, ever. As it 
worked out, as we came up, the 
four of them were standing in front 
of a pornographic bookstore. They 
were standing on top of themselves. 

“There they are,” Andridida 
said, clearly pleased. She switched 
off the machine. The four of them 
really were there, no double image. 

Andridida walked right up to 
them and said, “Hi.” 

I was right behind her. 

They saw me and they said, 
“Cop!” 

They started to take off. I didn’t 
even think to draw on them. For 



what? They had raped and mur- 
dered somebody who wasn’t or 
hadn’t been or had been buttoned 
out of it. What kind of crime was 
it? Anyway, it was Andridida’s 
rectification. 

The way I heard it, it really was 
a zap sound. 

They were gone. Their clothes 
and shoes were just in puddles on 
that filthy street. 

I turned to her, shrugged one 
more time. “Do I ask what hap- 
pened to them?” 

“They’re being rectified. Yeah,” 
she said nodding. 

“So then, that’s it?” 

“Yes. I think so, unless I made 
another mistake. But I don’t think 
I did.” 

“Well, that’s nice. You wouldn’t 
want to leave me your machine, 
would you?” 

“1 don’t think I’m allowed.” 

“Oh.” 

“Well, it was very nice knowing 
you and I hope you’ll forgive any 
problems I may have caused you.” 

“Nothing at all. My pleasure.” 

She stuck out her hand. I shook 
it. “Goodbye, Mike. I looked you 
up.” 

“Did you?” 

“Everything’s all right for you. 
It works out.” 

“Good to know. Thanks. 
Andridida.” 

She smiled and turned and 
walked away. I watched her until 
she rounded the corner. One hell of 
a girl. •

IF 




I F OLD-VALUE science fiction 
is on its way out nobody over at 
Doubleday seems to know it yet. In 
the past few months, the publishers 
have issued five giant volumes of 
older stories, at a total cost to the 
readers of $45.75! Unless publish- 
ers are losing their market sense, 
there must be a growing demand 
for fiction that was written before 
the new-value concept was devel- 
oped fully in our field. 

By old-value stories, I mean 
those that were essentially meant 
to entertain, where the emphasis 
was on story rather than on style dr 
relevancy to any current situ- 
ation — stories that tended to as- 
sume an expanding universe of 
man’s destiny. These might be 
called reader-oriented stories, since 
they were written for the general 



reader, with no thought of appeal- 
ing to the regular literary critics. 
The new-value stories, of course, 
are those which develop science fic- 
tion according to the current liter- 
ary and mainstream values, with 
style and significance given tnore 
emphasis than story. (We need 
some handy labels. But the new 
and old “wave” labels are so in- 
volved with emotional overtones 
and quasi-political feuds that they 
have become almost worthless.) 

One of these anthologies issued 
by Doubleday has been eagerly an- 
ticipated for some time, though its 
present form is something of a sur- 
prise. This is The Science Fiction 
Hall of Fame , edited by Ben Bova, 
made up of novellas. But instead of 
the expected single volume, we 
have two — Volume Two A and 




Volume Two B, at $9.95 each. 

The first volume of this series 
covered the shorter stories, and 1 
considered it the finest single book 
of science fiction ever published, 
justifying its claim to be the “great- 
est of all time.” The two new 
volumes make the same claim for 
the novellas, and the stories are 
certainly excellent. But I find I 
have very mixed reactions to the 
current books as an equal to the 
former superlative anthology. 

Much of the value of the first 
Hall of Fame came from a logical 
arrangement of stories according 
to their year of publication — that 
year clearly indicated. This enabled 
the reader to fix himself in time 
v and to get a clear perspective on 
the story in terms of the progress of 
the field. Any crudities in an early 
story could be easily understood 
and allowances therefore made. 
But here, for some reason (or lack 
of it), this logical approach has 
been abandoned. There is no dis- 
cernible pattern, which strikes me' 
as a rather careless way to deal 
with volumes meant to be 
definitive. 

The rationale behind the selec- 
tion of some stories and the use of 
two volumes for the novellas is 
sometimes also hard to discover. 
These stories were supposedly se- 
lected via voting by the members of 
the Science Fiction Writers of 



America under conditions govern- 
ing the selection of Nebula win- 
ners — e.g., these works would have 
merited the SFWA Nebula award, 
had that award existed when the 
stories were published. Or so I was 
told. In editing the first volume, 
Robert Silverberg followed this 
concept as closely as possible, list- 
ing the main votes and giving his 
reasons for the few deviations. 

Ben Bova also lists the top ten 
novellas chosen by the SFWA 
members. Eight of these are in- 
cluded in the A volume. A Walter 
Miller story is omitted necessarily 
because rights were not available, 
and one of the two Heinlein stories 
is dropped to avoid having more 
than one story by each author. (I 
find myself unsure of the wisdom 
of this; I rather think the best sto- 
ries should be used in any* list of 
“greatest,” even if half of them are 
by the same writer.) However, the 
top-rated ten authors are also 
listed, which adds only Poul An- 
derson to the list. His highest- 
choice novella is therefor added to 
Volume A. Fine, we now have nine 
stories. And probably the tenth ex- 
pected story could, have been the 
next highest choice below the top 
ten already mentioned. Maybe it 
is — but we don’t know; there are 
two other novellas in Volume A 
and eleven stories in Volume B. 
These are good stories, but was it 



104 



IF 




really necessary to have a second 
volume? And if so, shouldn’t the 
listing of top stories and top writers 
have been extended to show us 
why? 

I also feel less than happy about 
the inclusion of H. G. Wells’ The 
Time Machine in Volume A. True, 
it’s a great classic. But the fact re- 
mains that it first appeared at a 
time when not only was there no 
SFWA — but when there could 
have been no SFWA, because there 
was no regular field for science fic- 
tion writers. I don’t know about 
this. In fact, 1 wind up with more 
uncertainties about the choices 
than certainties. 

Volume Two A contains: Call 
Me Joe, by Poul Anderson; Who 
Goes There? by John W. Camp- 
bell; Nerves , by Lester del Rey; 
Universe , by Robert A. Heinlein; 
The Marching Morons , by C. M. 
Kornbluth; Vintage Season , by 
Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore; 

A nd Then There Were None , 
by Eric Frank Russell; The Ballad 
of Lost CMell, by Cordwainer 
Smith; Baby Is Three, by Theodore 
Sturgeon; The Time Machine , by 
H. G. Wells and With Folded 
Hands, by Jack Williamson. That’s 
a good list of stories, and well 
worth the price. Volume B also has 
excellent stories, but since these are 
apparently second-choice stories 
for this purpose, I suggest you look 



at the table of contents when you 
see the book and decide for your- 
self whether you want to spend the 
money. (The Introduction is identi- 
cal for both volumes, incidentally.) 

I think it might have been better 
to restrict the novellas to the single 
volume originally planned; that 
might have had more effect in de- 
fining the best of our longer works 
than this vaguely demarcated 
double volume. (Also, perhaps then 
the author advance might not have 
been restricted to Vi $ per word — a 
low rate which seems very curious 
for a project of the SFWA — an or- 
ganization that is supposed to be 
devoted to raising rates in our field. 
Since this advance is against royal- 
ties, it probably doesn’t matter; but 
half the usual advance doesn’t look 
good for a professional organiza- 
tion of this type!) 

Happily, Doubleday has done a 
much better job with the dust 
jacket this time, and the books are 
both more dignified and easier to 
read than the psychedelic mon- 
strosity on Volume One. 

^ HE Astounding- Analog Read - 
er, edited by Harry Harrison 
and Brian W. Aldiss, is another 
two-volume anthology (at $7.95 
per volume) from Doubleday. The 
first volume contains fifteen sto- 
ries, beginning with 1932 and end- 



READING ROOM 



105 




ing with 1946. The second volume 
had twenty-one stories, 1947 to 
1965 — all from Astounding and 
Analog, of course. The stories are 
arranged by date of publication, 
with a general introduction and 
separate introductions for each 
group of three stories. 

The selections here were made 
by Harrison and Aldiss, without 
any voting by larger groups. Yet 
they don’t suffer by comparison 
with the SFWA lists. Surprisingly, 
there were almost no duplicates be- 
tween these volumes and the Hall 
of Fame ones; only Anderson’s 
Call Me Joe and Moore and Ku- 
ttner’s Vintage Season are shared. 
(And only two shorter stories are 
shared with the earlier Hall of 
Fame volume.) 

Looking at the Harrison-Aldiss 
table of contents, it’s hard to see 
how some of the stories were not 
selected by the SFWA: Forgetful- 
ness, by Don A. Stuart — perhaps 
the ultimate romantic statement of 
man’s destiny; Farewell to the 
Master, by Harry Bates; By His 
Bootstraps, by Robert A. Hein- 
lein — the most complex of all time- 
travel stories; City, by Clifford D. 
Simak; Child’s Play, by William 
Tenn — and a great many others 
that are genuinely classic in qual- 
ity. There are a number of stories 
that I probably would not have se- 
lected — and a few I’d like to see 



here; but it is a list of stories that I 
can only consider outstanding. 

Probably by the nature of the 
magazines covered and my own 
taste, I like the first volume better 
than the second — but only by a 
narrow margin. 

I’d strongly recommend the 
Harrison-Aldiss volumes to anyone 
looking to see what made — and 
makes — science fiction wonderful. 
And if I had to choose between the 
two-volume SFWA set and the 
two-volume Harrison-Aldiss an- 
thology, I’d tend to take the lat- 
ter — I’d also save a few dollars, 
though that is incidental. Harrison 
and Aldiss have done a fine job of 
selecting and explaining the things 
that made Astounding I Analog a 
leader for so long! 

T HE fifth huge volume from 
Doubleday deals with the work 
of an even earlier period of maga- 
zine fiction than the other antholo- 
gies. This goes^all the way back to 
original science fiction published in 
the magazines in 1930 and 1932. It 
is Anthology : Three Novels, by 
John W. Campbell (Doubleday, 
$9.95). All the stories Campbell 
wrote about the characters Arcot, 
Wade and Morey are included fi- 
nally in this one volume — and a 
big, fat volume it is. 

I’ve already discussed the stories 
in an introduction to the book and 



106 



IF 




there’s a bonus introduction by 
Isaac Asimov. But this is the type 
of fiction that is almost certainly 
anathema to the literary among 
us — and dearly beloved by the rest 
of us, though it is now far in our 
background. Campbell took the 
story of man’s physical mastery of 
science and his conquest of space as 
far as it could go. He piled wonder 
on wonder, until no more was pos- 
sible. Back in 1932, he reached the 
ultimate limit of even such modern 
ideas as psi power. The effect defi- 
nitely isn’t literary — but man, how 
it moves! And I still find it fun to 
read. 

The stories are almost legendary 
now. I’m delighted to know they 
are finally in a permanent form I 
can keep and browse through once 
in a while. Nobody writes stories 
like that now. Perhaps nobody 
should, to be honest — but I’4n glad 
Campbell wrote them once, for all 
time! 

T HE other anthology and col- 
lection of good-old-days mate- 
rial are mercifully already in soft 
covers and hence less expensive. 
Science Fiction: the Great Years, 
edited by Carol & Frederik Pohl 
(Ace, $1.25) is a most welcome ad- 
dition to all the huge volumes. I’m 
delighted with it particularly for 
two reasons; first, it brought Carol 
Pohl — Fred’s most attractive 



wife — into the reading group of 
fans — she makes a welcome addi- 
tion to the book’s tone. And sec- 
ond, it brings Raymond Z. Gal- 
lun’s remarkable Old Faithful back 
to us, among the other excellent 
stories included. 

To a very large extent, three 
writers were responsible for science 
fiction as we know it. Two of 
them — John W. Campbell under 
the Don A. Stuart byline and Stan- 
ley G. Weinbaum — get and deserve 
credit for their influence on the 
field. But Ray Gallun began mov- 
ing toward the “Golden Age’’ of 
science fiction before them and he 
was one of the best early “living 
proofs” that science-fiction writers 
could handle real feeling and emo- 
tion. When his Old Faithful first 
appeared in 1934, it attracted more 
attention than any story of its 
length for the year. And it still 
stands up after all this time. The 
yarn is no longer novel — too many 
other writers have since taken off 
from Gallun’s inspiration — but it is 
just as fine to me as it always was. 
It is about time that some antholo- 
gist gave the attention to the story 
that it richly deserves. 

A NOTHER writer who did 
some of the best-liked stories 
in the good old days was Ross 
Rocklynne. His The Men and the 
Mirror (Ace, 95tf) is a collection of 



READING ROOM 



107 




related stories. Most of these fea- 
ture puzzles — men find themselves 
in situations where something is 
cockeyed and dangerous and work 
their way out by making the effort 
to understand their strange envi- 
ronment. The five stories in the 
book are all good examples of this. 

Curiously, my own favorite isn’t 
included — though it is listed on the 
copyright page. This is And Then 
There Was One , which I have al- 
ways considered the best story of 
its kind ever done in science fiction. 
If Ace decided to omit it because of 
the length of the book, I think it 
was a serious mistake. But even 
without it the book is worth the 
price. 

W E DON’T have to turn only 
to the past to discover old- 
value fiction, however. Fortunately 
some of the writers who loved to 
read the older stories are writing 
them today. Romance is not wholly 
dead — some of us still love the leg- 
endary Mars of Percival Lowell, 
even though Burroughs is dead and 
Leigh Brackett isn’t writing about 
it any more. 

The Man Who Loved Mars, by 
Lin Carter (Fawcett, 750) is in the 
grand tradition of such romance. 
Here are the dryland tribes with 
their exotic barbarian cultures, the 
ancient cities crumbling into slow 
and fabulous decay, the legends 



from the days of old and the few 
Earthmen who can exist among 
them. But Carter hasn’t completely 
neglected what we have learned of 
the planet from our space shots. He 
may have given us an atmosphere 
denser than the latest theories — but 
it’s an atmosphere that is much less 
dense than that of Barsoom. There 
are still two moons in the sky — but 
logically so tiny that they can’t be 
seen without exact knowledge and 
luck. And there’s a certain bitter- 
ness about the contact of Earthman 
and Martian that comes off very 
well indeed. 

Carter also captures the color 
and feeling of the planet as readers 
know it, the little touches that 
bring the romance of far-off worlds 
home to us. And the mystery of 
Martians who look like Earthman 
isn’t thrown aside, but becomes 
part of the plot. 

This is by all odds the best show- 
case of Carter’s writing I have 
seen. For this type of story, his 
people move naturally. The color 
he evolves for his world is tradi- 
tional, but he has made it very 
much his own. And the book hangs 
together. It’s Carter’s best to date, 
in my opinion, and I heartily rec- 
ommend it. 

O NE of the old values was that 
of honestly trying to please and 
satisfy the reader. Old-value fiction 



108 



IF 




demands that the writer assume 
that there is no obligation on the 
part of his reader to understand, 
appreciate or finish the story— the 
obligation is on the writer to pay 
the reader back for the investment 
of time and money. 

Without this sense of values no 
amount of borrowing backgrounds 
and methods can do an adequate 
job of recreating the type of adven- 
ture fiction many readers still 
demand. 

At the Narrow Passage , by 
Richard C. Meredith (Putnam, 
$5.95), seems to be the beginning of 
a good adventure novel. It isn’t. 

Among the best of the adventure 
writers, up to the time of his regret- 
table death, was H. Beam Piper, 
who built a complex society around 
the discovery of Paratime. The 
Paratime stories involved a sort of 
side-by-side time sequence — mil- 
lions of alternate todays could be 
reached. Meredith dedicates his 
book to the memory of Piper and 
the multiple worlds of Paratime. 
He’s honest abput his use of a 
similar background, happily. And 
I agree with him that there is 
much room for further adventure 
fiction in Piper's worlds. 

The novel begins well, too, 
though the intrustion of nonhu- 
mans into Paratime is something I 
found somewhat hard to take. (The 
general usefulness of the rule of 



“one assumption, and no more’’ is 
worth noting.) But generally this 
one began to shape up as a good ac- 
tion story, with our hero — and her- 
oine — moving into tighter and 
tighter jams. I enjoyed it until 

Well, I began to worry when 
only ten pages were left, but I kept 
hoping for something clever. Five 
more pages and I began to lose that 
hope. And then I hit the last page. 
Our hero and heroine had been 
caught between two forces, gradu- 
ally coming at them from both 
sides. So, they’re stranded. And let 
me quote the last three sentences: 

“Someone, somehow, must stop 
this hell before it destroys billions 
upon billions of human beings 
across the Lines and all the mag- 
nificient civilizations we’ve built. 
And if nobody else will do it, I 
guess it’ll be up to Sally and me. 
But damned if / know how (Ital- 
ics mine.) 

I don’t care if a sequel is planned 
or not. I wouldn’t read it if it came 
out, since such dishonesty, such to- 
tal lack of story value as that 
unending, means I can’t trust the 
writer ever again. 

It’s damned bad writing, and 
even worse editing— if the editor 
bothered to read it before buying it. 
Don’t be cheated! Both old-value 
and new-value writing deserve their 
readers — but no-value writing like 
that deserves only contempt. •

GENE WOLFE 




. to all of you, my 
dearly loved fellow country- 
men. And most particu- 
larly — as ever to my eyes, 
Westwind.” 

One wall of the steaming, 
stinking room began to wa- i 
ver, the magic portal that had 
opened upon a garden of al- 
most inconceivable beauty 
beginning to mist and 
change. Fountains of marble 
waved like grass, and rose 
trees, whose flowery branches 
wore strands of pearl and dia- 
mond, faded to soft old val- j 
entines. The ruler’s chair 
turned to bronze, then to um- 
ber, and the ruler himself, fa- 
therly and cunning, wise and 
unknowable, underwent a 
succession of transforma- i 
tions, becoming at first a pic- 
ture, then a poster and at last 
a postage stamp. 

THHE lame old woman who ran 
* the place turned the wall off 
and several people protested. “You 
heard what he said,” she told them. 
“You know your duty. Why do you 
have to listen to some simpleton 
from the Department of Truth say 
everything over in longer words 
and spread his spittle on it?” 

The protesters, having registered 
their postures, were silent. The old 
woman looked at the clock behind 



no 



the tiny bar she served. 

“Game in twenty minutes,” she 
said. “Folks will be coming in then, 
rain or no rain, wanting drinks. 
You want some, you better get 
them now.” 

Only two did: hulking, dirty men 
who might have been of any dis- 
honest trade. A few people were al- 
ready discussing the coming game. 
A few others talked about the ad- 
dress they had just heard— not its 
content, which could not have 
meant much to most of them — but 
about the ruler and his garden, ex- 
changing at hundredth hand bits of 
palace gossip of untold age. The 
door opened and the storm came in 
and a young man with it. 

He was tall and thin. He wore a 
raincoat that had soaked through 
and an old felt hat covered with a 
transparent plastic protection 
whose elastic had forced the hat's 
splayed brim into a tight bell 
around his head. One side of the 
young man's face was a blue 
scar — the old woman asked him 
what he wanted. 

“You have rooms,” he said. 

“Yes, we do. Very cheap, too. 
You ought to wear something over 
that.” 

“If it bothers you,” he said, 
“don't look at it.” 

“You think I’ve got to rent to 
you?'' She looked around at her 
customers, lining up support, 



should the young man with the scar 
decide to resent her remarks. “All 
I’ve got to do if you complain is say 
we’re full. You can walk to the po- 
lice station then — it’s twenty 
blocks-^and maybe they’ll let you 
sleep in a cell.” 

“I’d like a room and something 
to eat. What do you have?” 

“Ham sandwich,” she said. She 
named a price. “Your room — ” 
She named another. 

“All right,” he said. “I’d like 
two sandwiches. And coffee.” 

“The room is only half if you 
share with somebody — if you want 
me to I can yell out and see if any- 
body wants to split.” 

“No.” 

She ripped the top from a can of 
coffee. The handle popped out and 
the contents began to steam. She 
gave it to him and said, “I guess 
they won’t take you in the other 
places, huh? With that face.” 

¥JTE TURNED away from her, 
* -^sipping his coffee, looking the 
room over. The door by which he 
had just entered (water still 
streamed from his coat and he 
could feel it in his shoes, sucking 
and gurgling with his every move- 
ment) opened again and a blind girl 
came in. 

He saw that she was blind before 
he saw anything else about her. She 
wore black glasses, which on that

impenetrable, rain-wracked night 
would have been clue enough, and 
as she entered she looked (in the 
second most terrible and truest 
sense) at Nothing. 

The old woman asked, “Where 
did you come from?” 

“From the terminal,” the girl 
said. “1 walked.” She carried a 
white cane, which she swung before 
her as she sidled toward the sound 
of the old woman. 

“I need a place to sleep,” the girl 
said. 

Her voice was clear and sweet 
and the young man decided that 
even before the rain had scrubbed 
her face she hadn’t worn makeup. 

He said, “You don’t want to stay 
here. I’ll call you a cab.” 

“I want to stay here,” the girl 
said in her clear voice. “I have to 
stay somewhere.” 

“I tfave a communicator,” the 
young man said. He opened his 
coat to show it to her — a black box 
with a speaker, keys and a tiny 
screen — then realized that he had 
made a fool of himself. Someone 
laughed. 

“They’re not running.” * 

The old woman said, “What’s 
not running?” 

“The cabs. Or the buses. There’s 
high water in a lot of places all over 
the city and they’ve been shorting 
out. I have a communicator, 
too — ” the blind girl touched her 



waist — “and the ruler made a 
speech just a few minutes ago. I lis- 
tened to him as I walked and there 
was a newscast afterward. But I 
knew anyway because a gentleman 
tried to call one for me from the 
terminal, but they wouldn’t come.” 
“You shouldn't stay here,” the 
young man said. 

The old woman said, “I got a 
room if you want it — the only one 
left.” 

“I want it,” the girl told her. 
“You’ve got it. Wait a minute 
now — I’ve got to fix this fellow 
some sandwiches.” 

Someone swore at the old 
woman and said that the game was 
about to start. 

“Five minutes yet.” She took a 
piece of boiled ham from under the 
counter and put it between two 
slices of bread, then repeated the 
process. 

The young man said, “These 
look eatable. Not fancy, but eat- 
able. Would you like one?” 

“I have a little money,” the blind 
girl said. “I can pay for my own.” 
And to the old woman: “I would 
like some coffee.” 

“How about a sandwich?” 

“I’m too tired to eat.”

the storm and splashed in to watch 
the game. The old woman turned 
the wall on and they crowded near 
it, watching the pre-game warmup, 
practicing and perfecting the in- 
tentness they would use on the 
game itself. The scarred young 
man and the blind girl were edged 
away and found themselves nearest 
the door in a room now grown very 
silent save for the sound from the 
wall. 

The young man said, “This is 
really a bad place — you shouldn’t 
be here.” 

“Then what are you doing 
here?” 

“I don’t have much money,” he 
said. “It’s cheap.” 

“You don’t have a job?” 

“I was hurt in an accident. I’m 
well now, but they wouldn’t keep 
me on — they say I would frighten 
the others. I suppose I would.” 

“Isn’t there insurance for that?” 

“I wasn’t there long enough to 
qualify.” 

“I see,” she said. She raised her 
coffee carefully, holding it with 
both hands. He wanted to tell her 
that it was about to spill — she did 
not hold it quite straight — but 
dared not. Just as it was at the 
point of running over the edge it 
found her lips. 

“You listened to the ruler,” he 
said, “while you were walking in 
the storm. I like that.” 



“Did they listen here?” she 
asked. 

“I don’t know. I wasn’t here. 
The wall was off when I came in.” 
“Everyone should,” she said. 
“He does his best for us.” 

The scarred young man nodded. 
“People won’t cooperate,” she 
said. “Don’t cooperate. Look at 
the crime problem — everyone com- 
plains about it, but it is the people 
themselves who commit the crimes. 
He tries to clean the air, the water, 
all for us — ” 

“But they burn in the open 
whenever they think they won’t be 
caught,” the young man finished 
for her, “and throw filth in the riv- 
ers. The bosses live in luxury be- 
cause of him, but they cheat on the 
standards whenever they can. He 
should destroy them.” 

“He loves them,” the girl said 
simply. “He loves everyone. When 
we say that it sounds like we’re 
saying he loves no one, but that’s 
not true. He loves everyone .” 
“Yes,” the scarred young man 
said after a moment, “but he loves 
Westwind the best. Loving every- 
one does not include loving some- 
one more than others. Tonight he 
called Westwind ‘my eyes.’ ” 
“Westwind observes for him,” 
the girl said softly, “and reports. 
Do you think Westwind is someone 
very important?” 

“He is important,” the young

man said, “because the ruler listens 
to him — and after all, it’s next to 
impossible for anyone else to get an 
audience. But I think you mean 
‘does he look important to us?’ I 
don’t think so — he’s probably some 
very obscure person you’ve never 
heard of.” 

“I think you’re right,” she said. 

He was finishing his second 
sandwich and he nodded, then real- 
ized that she could not see him. She 
was pretty, he decided, in a slender 
way, not too tall, wore no rings. 
Her nails were unpainted, which 
made her hands look, to him, like a 
schoolgirl’s. He remembered 
watching the girls playing volley- 
ball when he had been in 
school — how he had ached for 
them. He said, “You should have 
stayed in' the terminal tonight. I 
don’t think this is a safe place for 
you.” 

“Do the rooms lock?” 

“I don’t know. I haven’t seen 
them.” 

“If they don’t I’ll put a chair un- 
der the knob or something. Move 
the furniture. At the terminal I 
tried to sleep on a bench — I didn’t 
want to walk here through all that 
rain, believe me. But every time I 
fell asleep I could feel someone’s 
hand on me — once I grabbed him, 
but he pulled away. I’m not very 
strong.” 

“Wasn’t anyone else there?” 



“Some men, but they were 
trying to sleep, too — of course it 
was one of them, and perhaps they 
were all doing it together. One of 
them told the others that if they 
didn’t let me alone he’d kill some- 
one — that was when I left. I was 
afraid he wasn’t doing it — that 
somebody would be killed or at 
least that there would be a fight. 
He was the one who called about 
the cab for me. He said he’d pay.” 
“I don’t think it was him, then.” 
“I don’t either.” The girl was si- 
lent for a moment, then said, “I 
wouldn’t have minded it so much if 
I hadn’t been so tired.” 

“I understand.” 

“Would you find the lady and 
ask her to show me to my room?” 
“Maybe we could meet in the 
morning for breakfast.” 

The blind girl smiled, the first 
time the scarred young man had 
seen her smile. “That would be 
nice,” she said. 

H E WENT behind the bar and 
touched the old woman’s arm. 
“I hate to interrupt the game,” he 
said, “but the young lady would 
like to go to her room.” 

“I don’t care about the game,” 
the old woman said, “I just watch 
it because everybody else does. I’ll 
get Obie to take care of things.” 
“She’s coming,” the scarred 
young man said to the blind girl.

IF 




“I’ll go up with you. I’m ready to 
turn in myself.” 

The old woman was already mo- 
tioning for them and they followed 
her up a narrow staircase filled 
with foul odors. ‘They pee in 
here,” she said. “There’s toilets 
down at the end of the hall but they 
don’t bother to use them.” 

“How terrible,” the girl said. 
“Yes it is. But that way they’re 
getting away with some- 
thing — they’re putting one over on 
me because they know if I was to 
catch them I’d throw them out. I 
try and catch them, but at the same 
time I feel sorry for them — it’s 
pretty bad when the only wins you 
have left are the games on the wall 
and cheating a old woman by dir- 
tying her steps.” She paused at the 
top of the stairs for breath. “You 
two are going to be just side by 
side — you don’t mind that?” 

The girl said, “No,” and the 
scarred young man shook his head. 

“I didn’t think you would and 
they’re the last I’ve got anyway.” 
The scarred young man was 
looking down the narrow corridor. 
It was lined with doors, most of 
them shut. 

“I’ll put you closest to the bath- 
room,” the old woman was saying 
to the~ girl. “There’s a hook on the 
bathroom door, so don’t you 
worry. But if you stay in there too 
long somebody’ll start pounding.” 



“I’ll be all right,” the girl said. 

“Sure you will. Here’s your 
room.” 

The rooms had_ been parts of 
much larger rooms once. Now they 
were subdivided with green-painted 
partitions of some stuff like heavy 
cardboard. The old woman went 
into the girl’s place and turned on 
the light. “Bed’s here, dresser’s 
there,” she said. “Washstand in the 
corner but you have to bring your 
water from the bathroom. No 
bugs — we fumigate twice a year. 
Clean sheets.” 

The girl was feeling the edge of 
the door. Her fingers found a chain 
lock and she smiled. 

“There’s a deadbolt too,” the 
scarred young man said. 

The old woman said, “Your 
room’s next door. Come on.” 

TTIS room was much like the 
* -^girl’s, save that the cardboard 
partition (it had been liberally 
scratched with obscene words and 
pictures) was on the left instead of 
the right. He found that he was 
acutely aware of her moving be- 
hind it, the tap of her stick as she 
established the positions of the bed, 
the dresser, the washstand. He 
locked his door and took off his 
soaked coat and hung it on a hook, 
then took off his shoes and stock- 
ings. He disliked the thought of 
walking on the gritty floor in his 



WESTWIND 



115 




wet feet, but there was no alterna- 
tive except the soggy shoes. With 
his legs folded under him he sat on 
the bed, then unhooked the com- 
municator from his belt and pushed 
123-333-4477, the ruler’s number. 

“This is Westwind,’’ the scarred 
young man whispered. 

The ruler’s face appeared in the 
screen, tiny and perfect. Again, as 
he had so often before, the young 
man felt that this was his real size, 
this tiny, bright figure — he knew it 
was not true. 

“This is Westwind and I’ve got a 
place to sleep tonight. I haven’t 
found another job yet, but I met a 
girl and I think she likes me.” 

“Exciting news,” the ruler said. 
He smiled. 

The scarred young man smiled, 
too, on his unscarred side. “It’s 
raining very hard here,” he said. “I 
think this girl is very loyal to you, 
sir. The rest of the people 
here — well, I don’t know. She told 
me about a man in the terminal 
who tried to molest her and an- 
other man who wanted to protect 
her. I was going to ask you to re- 
ward him and punish the other one, 
but I’m afraid they were the same 
man — that he wanted to meet her 
and this gave him the chance.” 

“They are often the same man,” 
the ruler said. He paused as though 
lost in thought. “You are all 
right?” 



“If I don’t find something to- 
morrow I won’t be able to afford a 
place to stay, but yes, I’m all right 
tonight.” 

“You are very cheerful. West- 
wind. I love cheerfulness.” 

The good side of the scarred 
young man’s face blushed. “It’s 
easy for me,” he said. “I’ve known 
all my life that I was your spy, your 
confidant — it’s like knowing where 
a treasure is hidden. Often I feel 
sorry for the others. I hope you’re 
not too severe with them.” 

“I don’t want to aid you openly 
unless I must," the ruler said. “But 
I’ll find ways that aren’t open. 
Don’t worry.” He winked. 

“I know you will, sir.” 

“Just don’t pawn your 
communicator.” 

The image was gone, leaving 
only a blank screen. The young 
man turned out the light and con- 
tinued to undress, taking off every- 
thing but his shorts. He was lying 
down on the bed when he heard a 
thump from the other side of the 
cardboard partition. The blind girl, 
feeling her way about the room, 
must have bumped into it. He was 
about to call, ‘*Xre you hurt?” 
when he saw that one of the panels, 
a section perhaps three feet by 
four, was teetering in its frame. He 
caught it as it fell and laid it on 
floor. 

The light the old woman had 



116 



IF 




turned on still burned in the girl’s 
room and he saw that she had hung 
up her coat and wrapped her hair in 
a strip of paper towels from the 
washstand. While he watched she 
removed her black glasses, set 
them on the bureau and rubbed the 
bridge of her nose. One of her eyes 
showed only white; the iris of the 
other was the poisoned blue color 
of watered milk and turned in and 
down. Her face was lovely. While 
he watched she unbuttoned her 
blouse and hung it up. Then she un- 
hooked her communicator ,from 
her belt, ran her fingers over the 
buttons once and, without looking, 
pressed a number. 

“This is Westwind,” she said. 

He could not hear the voice that 
answered her, but the face in the 



screen, small and bright, was the 
face of the ruler. “I’m all right,” 
she said. “At first I didn’t think I 
was going to be able to find a place 
to stay tonight, but I have. And 
I’ve met someone.” 

The scarred young man lifted the 
panel back into place as gently as 
he could and lay down again upon 
his bed. When he heard the rattle of 
her cane again he tapped the parti- 
tion and called, “Breakfast tomor- 
row. Don’t forget.” 

“I won’t. Good night.” 

“Good night,” he said. 

In the room below them the old 
woman was patting her straggling 
hair into place with one hand while 
she punched a number with the 
other. “Hello,” she said, “this is 
Westwind. I saw you tonight.” •

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

BENTLEY PRICE, Global

laxing before a Sunday after- 
noon backyard barbeque when a 
hole appears in the suburban 
landscape and people start 
marching through, four and five 
abreast. They are outlandishly 
costumed in garb ranging from 
long robes to buckskin, seem of all 
ages, peaceful and carry little or 
no luggage. When Bentley pro-

spokesman introduces himself as

daughter, ALICE. He and his fol- 
lowers have just come - are still

dren please use the bathroom? 

While a steady stream of the 
visitors line up to. use the facility, 
BENTLEY becomes convinced 
that if this is a publicity stunt it's a

tional emergency. 

29 . Once the men were seated 
around the table in the confer- 
ence room, Dr. Samuel Ives 
opened the discussion. 

“This meeting,’' he said, “de- 
spite the solemnity of the occa- 
sion that brings us together in the 
dead of night, marks what for all of 
us of the present must be an excit- 
ing event. Throughout our profes- 
sional lives most of us have at 
times puzzled over the funda- 
mental nature of time’s irre- 
versibility. A couple of us, my- 
self and Dr. Asbury Brooks, have 
spent a great deal of effort in its 
study. I am of the opinion that Dr. 
Brooks will not take it badly if I 
say we have made little, if any, 



progress. While the lay person — 
viewing time as a philosophical 
rather than a physical con- 
cept — may question the validity 
of our efforts the fact remains 
that the physical laws with which 
all of us work are embedded in this 
somewhat mysterious function 
we call time. We must ask our- 
selves, if we are completely to un- 
derstand the concepts we em- 
ploy, both in our daily lives and our 
continuing investigations in- 
to many areas of science, what 
may be the physical interrela- 
tionships underlying the expan- 
sion of the universe, informa- 
tion theory and the thermody- 
namic, electromagnetic, bio- 
logiqal and statistical arrows of 
time. In the description of any 
physical phenomenon the time 
variable is a parameter at the 
most elementary level. We have 
wondered if such a thing as uni- 
versal time exists — or are we 
dealing only with a feature of 
boundary conditions? There are 
some of us who think that the lat- 
ter may be true — that the time fac- 
tor was perhaps rather random- 
ly set at the moment of the begin- 
ning of the universe and that this 
concept has governed our think- 
ing ever since. And all of us are 
aware that our concepts of time 
must be overwhelmingly preju- 
diced by intuitive notions and

that this may be one of the factors 
that have made it so difficult for 
us to understand and formulate 
any real theories about the sub- 
ject." He looked across the table 
at the three men from the future. 
“I must beg your indulgence for 
this sort of introduction to our 
discussion — remarks that, in view 
of what you have learned, may 
sound somewhat silly. But I did 
think it important to set our own 
studies into some sort of perspec- 
tive. _Now that I have said this 
much, 1 think that it is your turn to 
talk. I assure you that all of us will 
listen most attentively. Which 
one of you would like to begin?" 

Hardwicke and Cummings 
looked at one another question- 
ingly. Finally Hardwicke said, 
"Perhaps I might as well. I must 
express the deep appreciation 
all of us feel at your willingness to 
meet with us at this unusual hour, 
i And I am afraid that we are about 
to disappoint you, for I must tell 
you that we know very little more 
about the fundamental nature 
of time than you do. We have 
asked ourselves some of the same 
questions you have asked and have 
found no real answers." 

"But you can travel in time," 
said Brooks. "That would argue 
that you must know something of 
it. You must have at least a basic 
understanding—" 



"What we found," said Ffard- 
wicke, "is that we are not the only 
universe. There are at least two 
universes coexisting within the 
same space, but universes so fun- 
damentally different from one 
another that neither ordinarily 
would be aware of the other. At 
the moment I will not go into the 
manner in which this other uni- 
verse was detected or what we 
know of it. It is not, however, a 
contraterrene universe, so there 
is, so far as we know, no danger 
from it. I might add that the first 
hint of its existence came from a 
study of the strangeness of certain 
particles. The particles them- 
selves are a part of our universe, 
but in some instances they may re- 
act to certain not entirely under- 
stood conditions in the other. We 
now have postulated two totally 
different universes — the other 
made up of particles and inter- 
actions that have little to do with 
ours. Interactions occur on so 
small a scale that only blind, 
dumb luck could bring them to 
one’s notice. 

“Fortunately our research- 
ers experienced that kind of luck. 
And it was mostly luck, too, that 
revealed to us something else 
about the second universe. I of- 
ten wonder if luck itself should be 
the subject of a study with a view 
to a better determination of its 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



121 




parameters. As I said, we found 
out one other thing about the oth- 
er universe — a simple but devas- 
tating discovery. We learned 
that the arrow of time in the sec- 
ond universe flows in exactly the 
opposite direction to the one it 
travels in ours. While undoubted- 
ly in that universe it was moving 
from the universe’s past toward its 
future — in relation to our uni- 
verse it was traveling from our fu- 
ture toward our past.” 

“One thing puzzles me,” said 
Ives. “You were dealing with a 
very complex matter and yet in 
twenty years or so — ” 

“It is not as remarkable as you 
think,’’ said Cummings. “We 
launched a crash project, certain- 
ly, to achieve our means of coming 
here, but by then we were in pos- 
session of the knowledge Dr. 
Hardwicke has just outlined. On 
your old time track the second 
universe was discovered some- 
what less than a hundred years 
from now. It had been investi- 
gated for almost four centuries 
before we finally put the- time ar- 
row of the second universe to 
work. As a matter of fact, much 
significant work had been done 
on the possibility of using the 
opposite time direction of the 
second universe as a time-travel 
medium. All we had to do was 
give the investigation a final 



push. I think the method we final- 
ly devised might have been worked 
out earlier — even before the in- 
vasion by the aliens — if there had 
been any reason for doing so. 
But, aside from scientific curi- 
osity, we had little motive. Un- 
der ordinary circumstances 
there’s not much attraction to 
time travel— if you can move in 
only one direction and there's no 
possibility of returning. 

“By the time we decided," said 
Hardwicke, “that the only way 
we could survive was to travel 
back into time, much of the real 
work already had been done. 
Throughout the history of scien- 
tific inquiry a certain segment 
of the population has always 
questioned the validity of pure re- 
search. What is the good of it? 
How is it going to help us? What 
can we use it for? I think our situ- 
ation is a perfect example of the 
value of basic research. The 
work that had been done on the 
second universe and its time flow 
had been pure research, an expen- 
diture of effort and funds that 
seemed to offer no chance at all of 
either benefit or return. And yet, 
as things turned out, it did have a 
return. It offered the human race 
a chance to save itself.” 

“As I understand it, said 
Brooks, “what you have done is 
make use of the opposite time 



122 



IF 




flow of the other universe to bring 
you here. Somehow or other your 
time tunnels trap the opposite 
flow. You step into the reverse 
stream in your own present time 
and step out of it in ours. But to do 
this you must manage to speed up 
the time flow tremendously and 
be able to control it." 

Hardwicke said, “The hard part 
of the job was the implementa- 
tion theories that had already been 
worked out. Still, the end result 
turned out to be unbelievably 
simple to achieve.” 

“You think it is in the range of 
our present technology." 

“We are sure of it," said Hard- 
wicke. “That is why we chose your 
particular period. We had to se- 
lect a target that held men who 
would understand and accept our 
theories — and other men who 
could build the necessary equip- 
ment. We also needed to reach a 
time whose intellectual and 
moral climate was such that there 
would be a willingness to provide 
us the help we needed. We also 
had to find a period with an econ- 
omy productive enough to sup- 
ply us with the implements and 
tools we would need to start life 
anew in the Miocene. Perhaps we 
are being unfair to hope for so 
much from you. We have one justi- 
fication. If we had not come back 
to you the race of man would have 



ended some five hundred years 
from now. As it is, you have been 
shifted to a new time track, a phe- 
nomenon we can take time later 
to discuss, if you wish. For there 
now is a chance, although no cer- 
tainty, that you can continue in- 
to a future that holds no alien in- 
vasion." 

“Dr. Osborne, said Ives, “has 
so far taken no part in this discus- 
sion. Is there something you might 
like to add?" 

Osborne shook his head. “All 
this is beyond my competence, 
gentlemen. I'm not a physicist, 
but a geologist with leanings 
toward paleontology. I'm sim- 
ply along for the ride. Later, if 
some of you want to discuss the 
Miocene, which is our eventual 
destination— that is something 
I could talk about." 

Brooks said, “I would be inter- 
ested in hearing you right now. It's 
been proposed that some of the 
present population of the Earth 
go back into the Miocene with 
you. The idea might appeal to the 
more venturesome among us. 
Would you be willing to tell us 
what you think we might find in the 
Miocene?" 

“I would be glad to. You must 
understand, of course, that we are 
dealing in suppositions, al- 
though we can be fairly sure of 
some facts. The main reason we 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



123 




picked the Miocene is that grass 
first appeared upon the Earth 
then — grazing animals seem to 
have increased rapidly in the 
early part of the epoch. The cli- 
mate later became somewhat 
more arid, although by our calcu- 
lations there still would have been 
plenty of rainfall for agricul- 
ture. Many of the huge forest 
tracts gave way to grassy plains, 
supporting herds of herbivores. 
Evidence has been found of oreo- 
donts, sheep-sized animals that 
may have been remote relatives 
of the camels. There would have 
been camels, too, although far 
smaller than the ones you know 
today. We could expect to find 
small horses, the size of ponies. We 
might see a number of rhinos. 
Some time during the Miocene, 
probably in its early days, ele- 
phants migrated to North Ameri- 
ca over the Bering land bridge. 
They would have been four-tusk- 
ers, smaller than today's ele- 
phants. One of the more danger- 
ous animals would have been the 
giant pig, big as oxen and with 
skulls that measured four feet 
long — ugly customers to meet. 
With so many herbivores running 
in herds on the prairies, the Mio- 
cene could be expected to have its 
full quota of carnivores, both ca- 
nines and felines — probably the 
ancestors of the sabertooths. 



That's only a quick rundown. 
There is much more. The point is 
that we believe the Miocene was 
a time of rather rapid evolution- 
ary development, with the fauna 
expanding into new genera and 
species — the changes character- 
ized overall, perhaps, by a ten- 
dency of animals to increase in 
size. There might be a number of 
holdovers from the Oligocene, 
even from the Eocene. I suppose 
some of the mammals might be 
dangerous. There could be poi- 
sonous snakes and insects — I'm 
not entirely sure of that. As a 
matter of fact, we have little evi- 
dence along those lines." 

“In your estimation, how- 
ever," said Brooks, “modern man 
could survive in the Miocene." 

“We are sure he could. He could 
live off the land until he got 
started. There would be plenty of 
game, nuts, berries, fruit, roots. 
Fishing should be good. We're not 
as sure about the climate as we'd 
like to be, but there is some evi- 
dence that it would be more equa- 
ble than now. The summers prob- 
ably would be as warm, the win- 
ters not so cold. You understand 
this can’t be guaranteed." 

“I understand that, said 
Brooks, “but in any case — you're 
set on going?" 

“We have," said Osborne, 
“very little choice."

30 . Steve Wilson came back in- 
to the pressroom. The desk lamp 
was still lit, painting a circle of 
light in the darkened room. The 
teletypes muttered against the 
wall. Almost three o'clock, he 
realized. He'd have to get some 
sleep. Even with the best of luck he 
had four hours or so before he had 
to be on the job again. 

As he approached the desk 
Alice Gale rose from a chair set in 
the room's shadows. She still wore 
her white robe. He wondered if it 
was all the clothing she had. The 
people from the future had car- 
ried litle luggage. 

“Mr. Wilson," she said, “we 
have been waiting for you, hoping 
that you would come here. My fa- 
ther wants to talk with you. Will 
you see him?" 

“Certainly, said Wilson. 
“Good morning, Mr. Gale." 

Gale came out of the darkness 
and laid his attache case on the 
desk top. 

“1 am somewhat embar- 
rassed," he said. “1 find myself in 
a position that could be awk- 
ward. I wonder if you would lis- 
ten to me and tell me how to go 
about what I want to do. You seem 
to be a man who knows his way 
around." 

Wilson, moving to the desk, 
stiffened. The whole thing, he 
sensed, as Gale had said, had an 



awkwardness about it. He sensed 
he was going to be placed in a dif- 
ficult position. He waited. 

“We are well aware," said Gale, 
“that our coming from the future 
has placed a terrible burden 
upon the governments and the 
peoples of the world. We did what 
little we could. In areas where we 
knew there would be food short- 
ages we arranged the delivery of 
wheat and other foodstuffs. We 
stand ready to supply any labor 
that will be required, for we rep- 
resent a large and idle labor 
force. But the building of the tun- 
nels and the supplying tq us of the 
tools we will need in the Miocene 
will represent a vast expendi- 
ture of funds — " 

He reached down into the cir- 
cle of light on the desk top, un- 
latched the case, opened it. It was 
packed with small leather bags. 
Lifting one of these, he pulled it 
open and poured out a shower of 
cut stones that flashed and glit- 
tered in the light. 

“Diamonds," he said. 

Wilson gulped. “But why?" he 
whispered. “Why diamonds? And 
why bring them to me?" 

“These stones provided the on- 
ly way we could bring anything of 
value in small enough volume to 
be conveniently transported. 
We know that if they were dumped 
on the exchanges all at once they 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



125 




would ruin much of your econo- 
my. But if they were fed into the 
market a few at a time, surrepti- 
tiously, they would have little ef- 
fect. This is especially true if 
their existence can be kept se- 
cret. We have been very careful 
that there be no duplications — 
that no paradoxes are involved 
with their presence here. It would 
have been possible to have 
brought from the future many of 
the famous gems that now exist 
and are well known. We have not 
done this. All the stones in this case 
were found and cut in' your fu- 
ture.” 

“Put them back,” said Wilson, 
horrified. “Good God, man, can 
you imagine what might happen 
if it became known what was in 
that case? Billions of dollars — ” 

“Yes, many billions,” Gale said 
calmly, “at the going prices in 
this age. They are worth much 
more here than they were in our 
time.” 

Unhurriedly he picked up the 
stones, put them back into the 
bag, fitted the bag back into the 
case, closed and latched it. 

“I wish,” said Wilson, “you 
hadn’t told me about this.” 

“But we had to,” Alice said. 
“Don’t you see? You are the only 
one we know — the only person 
we can trust. We knew we could 
safely tell you — and that you 



could tell us what we should do.” 
Wilson struggled to put some 
calmness into his words. “Let’s 
all sit down,” he said, “and talk 
this over. And let’s not speak too 
loudly. I don’t think there is any- 
one around, but someone could 
walk in.” 

They went back beyond the cir- 
cle of light, pulled three chairs to- 
gether and sat down. 

“Now suppose you tell me,” 
Wilson said, “what you’re really 
driving at.” 

“We had thought,” said Gale, 
“that the proceeds from these 
stones, wisely marketed, could 
compensate in part for some of 
the actual costs your helping us 
entails. Not one government, not 
one people, but all the govern- 
ments and all the peoples of the 
Earth are involved.” 

“In that case — ” 

“I anticipate your question. 
Why were the stones not divided 
and offered to the separate gov- 
ernments? There are two reasons 
this was not done. We want to keep 
the number of those who know of 
these stones to a minimum. Next, 
there are few governments we can 
trust — actually some of us felt 
the United Nations should be the 
organization entrusted with the 
gems. But frankly, we have little 
confidence in the U. N. Next I 
was supposed to hand the stones to

your President. I decided against 
this when I realized how many 
problems he had weighing on his 
mind and how often he was forced 
to depend on the judgments of 
many other people.” 

"I know one thing,” said Wil- 
son. "You can't keep on carrying 
this case around with you. You 
have to be placed under security 
until it has been put into some 
safe place. Fort Knox, probably, 
if the government is willing to 
accept it.” 

"You mean, Mr. Wilson, that 
I'll have to be placed under guard? 
Fm not sure I like that. 

"Christ, 1 don't know,” said 
Wilson. "I don't even know where 
to begin. 

He reached for the phone and 
dialed. "Jane, you still on duty ? Do 
you know — has the President re- 
tired?” 

"An hour ago,” said Jane. 

"Good, said Wilson. "He 
should have gone to bed long be- 
fore then.” 

"Is it important, Steve? He left 
orders that if anything impor- 
tant came up he should be called.” 

"No, this can wait. Do you think 
you can get hold of Jerry Black?” 

"I'll try. 1 think he's still 
around.” 

The room was silent except for 
the teletypes. Gale and Alice sat 
unstirring in their chairs. Light 



still shone beneath the press- 
lounge doors, but there was no 
sound of typing. 

"We're sorry to upset you so,” 
Alice said to Wilson. "But we 
were at our wits' ends. We didn't 
know what to do.” 

"It's all right,” said Wilson. 
"You don't know how much this 
means to us,” she said. "The rest of 
the people may not know till lat- 
er, but we'll know that we did not 
come as beggars. That we paid our 
way. That's important to us.” 
Footsteps came down the corri- 
dor and turned in at the door. 

"What's going on, Steve?" 
asked Jerry Black. 

"We need a couple of men," 
said Wilson. 

"I'm one of them,” said Black. 
"I can find another.” 

"It'll be a favor,” said Wilson. 
"I have no jurisdiction. I'm act- 
ing on my own. It'll be until to- 
morrow morning — or as soon as 
I can see the President.” 

"It's okay,” said Black, "if it's 
for the President.” 

"I think,” said Wilson, "that it 
might be for him.” 

"All right. What is it?” 

"Mr. Gale has an attache ease. I 
won't tell you what is in it. You 
wouldn't want to know. But it's im- 
portant. And I want him to keep 
it — him and no one else. Until we 
know what to do with it.” 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN

“That can be managed. You 
think it needs two of us?" 

“I’d feel better if there were two 
of you." 

“No trouble," said Black. “Let 
me use your phone." 

31 . Dawn was graying the east- 
ern sky when Enoch Raven sat 
down to his typewriter. Outside 
the window lay the green Virginia 
hills, and in the trees and shrubs a 
few awakening birds began their 
twittering and chirping. 

He flexed his fingers over the 
keyboard and then began to type 
steadily and without pause. He 
had made it a rule these many 
years to have his words thought out 
before he sat down to write his col- 
umn. 

The world today faces 
what may be its greatest 
crisis, and the strangeness of 
this lies in the fact that the 
crisis comes not by the ordi- 
nary channels. Although, 
when one thinks it through, it 
becomes apparent that the 
present difficulty does par- 
allel a problem we have 
long recognized— over- 
population and the eco- 
nomic problems that could 
spring from it. As short a 
time ago as last Sunday 



morning, however, no one 
in his right mind could have 
imagined that a critical 
overpopulation could come 
upon us overnight. 

Now that it has, we are 
faced with a situation that 
must be solved, not over a 
long period of careful plan- 
ning, but in a matter of 
weeks. The brutal fact is that 
we can feed the hordes of 
people who have come to us 
for help for only a very 
limited span of time. They 
themselves are frank in ad- 
mitting that they were aware 
of the problems their com- 
ing would create and in con- 
sequence of this have 
brought us the knowledge 
and the tools we will need in 
solving them. All that re- 
mains is that we use these 
tools. This requires the will- 
ing cooperation of every 
one of us. These words are 
not used lightly, nor in a hor- 
atory political sense, but in 
a very personal way. Every 
one of us, each of us, all of us. 

What is -needed from most 
of us is forbearance, a will- 
ingness to bear certain sac- 
rifices, to tolerate certain 
inconveniences. It may 
mean that there will be less 
food — and that not so 



128 



IF 




good — for us to eat. We may 
have to wait for delivery of 
that new car. We may not be 
able to buy a new lawnmow- 
er when the 'old one breaks 
down. The economic ener- 
gy and direction that under 
normal circumstances would 
be channeled into the produc- 
tion and distribution of items 
and services we need must be 
channeled not only into send- 
ing our descendants farther 
back into time, but into pro- 
viding them with the equip- 
ment, tools and supplies they 
will need to build a viable 
culture. Detroit may be 
called on to turn out plows 
and other implements rath- 
er than cars. It may be that, 
voluntarily or by govern- 
ment decree, we may have to 
ration ourselves. Wise as 
the actions taken by Presi- 
dent Henderson may have 
been in calling for a bank 
holiday and a price and wage 
freeze, a case can be made 
for his having taken one 
further step by issuing a 
strong warning against 
hoarding. While we can ill 
afford to deal in a bureau- 
cratic manner with the press 
of events that has been 
forced upon us, it would 
seem that some move toward 



a strict rationing of food and 
other items vital to the con- 
tinuing economy should be 
taken at once. It is quite 
understandable, for politi- 
cal reasons, why Mr. Hen- 
derson might have been re- 
luctant to do this. But it is 
upon such unpopular ac- 
tions — or the failure to take 
these actions — that we 
sometimes stand or fall. 

It would scarcely seem 
necessary to point out that 
such actions as the Presi- 
dent has taken should be 
taken by other nations as 
well. It is reliably under- 
stood that Britain, Russia, 
France, Germany, Japan, 
China and possibly other 
nations may already have 
made corresponding moves 
before these words see print. 
The problem we face is 
worldwide and for it to be 
solved temporary econom- 
ic strictures must be im- 
posed not only upon the 
larger economic units, but 
upon the entire world. 

The appearance of the 
people from the future un- 
doubtedly will call forth 
from the various intellec- 
tual factions a wide variety 
of opinions, many of which 
undoubtedly will be ill- 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



129 




founded. This is illustrated 
by the public agony being 
exhibited by the Reverend 
Jake Billings, one of the 
more colorful of our evan- 
gelists, over the revelation 
that the people of five hun- 
dred years from now have 
forsaken religion as a 
rather footless factor in the 
lives of men. Distressing as 
this may be to the profes- 
sional religionists, it is 
scarcely a consideration 
that has any bearing on the 
matter immediately at 
hand. Not only on this point, 
but on many others, pro- 
found questions will be 
raised, but now is not the 
time to expend any notice- 
able amount of energy in 
trying to answer or resolve 
them. They will only further 
divide a population which, 
under the best of circum- 
stances, is bound to be di- 
vided by the basic task which 
has been brought upon us. 

We have not yet had time, 
nor indeed enough facts, to 
form a true evaluation of 
the situation. While we have 
been made aware of some of 
the basics, much is yet un- 
known. 

There is no time, of course, 
for deliberate consider- 



ation of the crisis — in es- 
sence, the world must act 
with more expediency than 
may be entirely wise. The 
very fact that expediency is 
necessary calls for a public 
forbearance that is usually 
not desirable when great is- 
sues are at stake. A storm of 
criticism and a violent put- 
ting forward of opinions at 
variance with official opin- 
ion and action will accom- 
plish nothing other than an 
impedance to a solution 
which must come quickly if 
it is to come at all. The men 
in Washington, at Whitehall 
and in the Kremlin may be 
wrong on many points, but 
their various publics must 
realize that they will be act- 
ing in honest good faith, do- 
ing what they consider 
proper. 

Democracy demands, 
and rightly, that all men 
should have a voice in their 
government and in govern- 
mental decisions and ac- 
tions, that all viewpoints be 
given fuM consideration, 
that there be no arbitrary 
decisions counter to the 
public will. But today we 
cannot afford the luxury of 
such an idealistic concept. 
The situation may not be 



130 



IF 




handled as many of us would 
wish. Some toes undoubted- 
ly will be trod upon. Certain 
ideas of justice and propri- 
ety may be outraged. But to 
accept all of this, if not in si- 
lence, at least without rais- 
ing too great an outcry, is a 
part of the forbearance that 
is called for. 

This commentator has 
no way of knowing what will 
happen. I cannot even 
guess. I am aware that there 
may be much that I will not 
like, much that I will consid- 
er could be done differently 
or better. In the past there 
has been no hesitancy on 
my part to place my person- 
al opinion on record and at 
a later date, after this is 
over, I suppose I may not be 
above pointing out glaring 
errors as I may have per- 
ceived them. But from this 
day forward and until then I 
shall, as a personal con- 
tribution, exercise stern 
censorship upon, if not my 
thoughts, at least upon my 
typewriter. I am hereby en- 
rolling myself as charter 
member in the Keep Your 
Mouth Shiit, Enoch, Club. 
The membership is wide 
open and I invite all of you 
to join. 



32 . He had somehow climbed a 
tree and gotten out on a limb— for 
no reason that seemed quite logi- 
cal — when a violent wind had 
come up. Now he was hanging 
grimly to a branch whipping in 
the wind. He knew that at any mo- 
ment his grasp might be tom loose 
and he would be thrown to the 
ground. But when he looked down 
he saw, with horror, that there 
wasn’t any ground. 

From somewhere far off, a voice 
was speaking to him, but he was so 
intent on maintaining his grip on 
the branch that he was unable to 
distinguish the words. The shak- 
ing became even more violent. 

“Steve,” the voice was saying. 
“Steve, wake up.” His eyes came 
open to a slit and he realized that 
he was in no tree. A distorted face 
swam crazily just above him. No 
one had such a face. 

“Wake up, Steve,” said a voice 
that was Henry Hunt’s. “The 
President is asking for you.’’ 
Wilson lifted a fist and scrubbed 
his eyes. The face, no longer dis- 
torted, was Henry Hunt’s. 

The face receded into the dis- 
tance as the Times man straight- 
ened. Wilson swung his feet off the 
couch, sat up. Sunlight was 
streaming through the windows 
of the press lounge. 

“What time is it?” he asked. 

“Almost eight.”

Wilson squinted up at Hunt. 
“You get any sleep?” 

“I went home for a couple of 
hours. I couldn’t sleep. Things kept 
spinning in my head. So I came 
back.” He picked a jacket off the 
floor. “This yours?” 

Wilson nodded groggily. “I got 
to get washed up,” he said. “I got 
to comb my hair.” He rose to his 
feet, took the jacket from Hunt 
and tucked it under his arm. 
“What’s going on?” 

“What you might expect. The 
wires are clogged with screams of 
anguish over the business holi- 
day. How come you didn’t tip us 
off, Steve?” 

“I didn’t know. He never said a 
word about it.” 

“Well, that’s all right,” said 
Hunt. “We should have guessed it. 
Can you imagine what would have 
happened if the exchanges were 
open?” 

“Any word about the monster?” 

“Rumor. Nothing solid. One 
rumor says another got through 
in Africa. Somewhere in the 
Congo. Christ, they’ll never find it 
there.” 

“The Congo’s not all jungle, 
Henry.” 

“Where it’s supposed to have 
happened, it is.” 

Wilson headed for the wash- 
room. When he returned Hunt had 
a cup of coffee for him. 



“Thanks.” Wilson sipped the 
hot brew and shuddered. “I don't 
know if I can face the day,” he 
said. “Any idea of what the Presi- 
dent has in mind?” 

Hunt shook his head. 

“Judy in yet?” 

“Not yet, Steve.” 

Wilson put the cup down on the 
coffee table. “Thanks for getting 
me up and going,” he said. “I’ll 
see you later.” 

He went into the pressroom. 
The lamp he had forgotten to 
turn off still shone feebly on the 
desk. In the corridor outside 
footsteps went smartly up and 
down. He straightened his jacket 
and went out. 

Two men were with the Presi- 
dent. One was General Daniel 
Foote; the other was one of the 
refugees, rigged out in a moun- 
taineer outfit. 

“Good morning, Mr. Presi- 
dent,” said Wilson. 

“Good morning, Steve. You get 
any sleep?” 

“An hour or so.” 

“You know General Foote, of 
course,” said the President. “The 
gentleman with him is Isaac 
Wolfe. Dr. Wolfe is a biologist. 
He brings us rather frightening 
news. I thought you should hear 
it.” 

Wolfe was a heavy man — heavy 
of body, deep in the chest, stand- 



132 



IF 




ing on short, solid legs. His head, 
covered by a rat’s nest of graying 
hair seemed overlarge for a man 
his height. 

He stepped quickly forward 
and shook Wilson’s hand. “1 am 
sorry,” he said, “to be the bearer 
of such disturbing facts.” 

“Last night,” said the Presi- 
dent, “rather, some time this 
morning, a farmer not far from 
Harper’s Ferry was wakened by 
something in his chicken coop. 
He went out and found the hen- 
house full of strange beasts, the 
size, perhaps, of half-grown hogs. 
He fired at them and they got 
away, all except one which the 
shotgun blast almost cut in two. 
The farmer was attacked. He’s in 
a hospital. He’ll live, I’m told, 
but he was fairly well chewed up. 
From what he says there can be lit- 
tle doubt the things in the hen- 
house were a new batch of the mon- 
sters.” 

“But that’s impossible, said 
Wilson. “The monster escaped 
only a few — ” 

“Dr. Wolfe came to me last eve- 
ning,” said Foote, “shortly after 
the monster escaped from the 
tunnel. I frankly didn’t believe 
what he told me, but when the re- 
port of the henhouse episode came 
in from an officer of a search par- 
ty out in West Virginia, 1 looked 
him up and asked him to come to 



the White House. I’m sorry, Doc- 
tor, for not believing you to start 
with.” 

“But it’s still impossible,” said 
Wilson. 

“No,” said Wolfe. “It is not im- 
possible. We are dealing with an 
organism entirely different 
from anything you’ve ever known. 
The evolutionary processes of 
these monsters are like nothing 
you have even guessed. Their reac- 
tion to environmental stress is 
beyond all belief. We had known 
something of it and had deduced 
the rest. But I am convinced that 
under stresses such as the escaped 
monster is experiencing, the 
developmental procedures can 
be speeded up to a fantastic rate. 
An hour or so to hatch — an hour 
later to be hunting food. The 
same pressure that is placed upon 
the parent is transmitted to the 
young. For both the parent and 
the young this is a crisis situation. 
The parent is aware of this, of 
course — the young, of course, 
would not be. But in some strange 
manner I can’t pretend to under- 
stand a sense of desperate ur- 
gency is transmitted to the egg. 
The message seems to read: Hatch 
swiftly, grow up quickly, scatter 
widely, reach the egg-laying stage 
as soon as possible. It is a genetic 
reaction to a survival threat. The 
young aliens are driven by an ^vo- 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



133 




lutionary force that in an earthly 
life form would be inconceivable. 
They are members of a strange 
race that has a unique and inborn 
capability to use every trick in 
the evolutionary pattern to its 
advantage.” 

Wilson found a chair and sat 
down limply. He looked at the 
President. “Has any of this 
leaked out?” 

“No,” said the President, “it 
has not. The farmer’s wife phoned 
the sheriff. The military search 
party had just reached the area 
and was talking with the sheriff 
when the call came in. The officer 
in charge clamped on a security 
lid. That is why you’re here, Steve. 
We can’t keep this buttoned up. 
It’ll leak out — if not this particu- 
lar incident, then others. There 
may be hundreds of these tiny 
monsters out there in the moun- 
tains. They’ll be seen and re- 
ported. The reports will begin to 
pile up. We can’t sit on all of them, 
nor should we.” 

“The problem,” said Wilson, 
“is how to release the news with- 
out scaring the pants off every- 
body.” 

“If we don’t tell them,” said the 
President, “we create a credi- 
bility gap that will make every- 
thing we do suspect. And there is, 
as well, the matter of public safe- 
ty.” 



“In a few days,” said Foote, “all 
the mountains will be swarming 
with full-grown monsters. They 
will probably scatter. We can 
hunt some of them down, but not 
all. In any event we’ll need every 
man we can lay our hands on to 
hunt them down.” 

“That they will scatter is right,” 
said Wolfe. They will want to in- 
sure their chances of survival. And 
they can travel fast. By mother 
day, perhaps, they'll be up in New 
England, down into Georgia. 
They will keep, at first, to the 
mountainous terrain because it 
would give them the best conceal- 
ment. In time they'll begin 
branching out from the moun- 
tains.” 

“How long would you guess,” 
asked Wilson, “before they be- 
gin laying eggs?” 

Wolfe spread his hands. “Who 
can know?” he said. 

“Your best guess.” 

“A week. Two weeks.. I do not 
know.” 

“How many eggs in a clutch?” 

“A couple of dozen. You must 
understand we do not know. We 
found only a few -nests.” 

“When will they begin their kill- 
ing?” 

“Now. Right now. They must* 
eat to grow. They must do a lot of 
killing. Wild animals, farm ani- 
mals and occasionally humans. 



134 



IF 




Not many humans to start with. 
By killing men they draw atten- 
tion to themselves. Warlike as 
they may be, they still will know 
they are vulnerable because there 
are so few of them. They may be 
psychopathic killers, but they 
aren't stupid." 

“We have some troops out 
now," said the President. "We'll 
have to use many more. Get planes 
and helicopters up to spot the 
aliens. 1 talked to Sandburg just a 
while ago. He is coming in. He'll 
know what we can do. This means 
we call out the reserves, perhaps 
call back some troops from 
abroad. Not only do we have to 
hunt the monsters, but we have to 
maintain the camps for the refu- 
gees." 

"We do not wish to stand idly 
by," Wolfe put in. "There are 
many thousands of us. Give us 
arms and we'll go in side by side 
with your military. We know 
about these creatures and we were 
the ones who brought them here. 
We have a duty and — " 

"Later," said the President, 
"there will be plenty you can do. 
Getting you into the field now 
would be a tremendous task. 
Right at the moment we must de- 
pend on our own men." 

"How about the people out 
there in the mountains?" asked 
Wilson. "Do we pull them out?" 



The President shook his head. 
"I don't think so, Steve. We have, 
right now, all the refugees we can 
handle. And I'm inclined to think 
that at the moment our monsters 
may not be too aggressive. 
They're probably concentrat- 
ing on staying out of sight. There 
may be some incidents, but we 
must be prepared to accept those. 
It's all we can do. 

"I think you're right, sir," said 
Wolfe. "They are outnumbered 
now and must build up their 
strength. In any event, the young 
aliens will not, for a time, be too 
great a menace. They'll have to 
put on size and weight. They may 
know that they face deadlier wea- 
pons — and in much greater num- 
bers — than anything we could 
ever bring against them. We had 
lived in peace so long we had lost 
most of the military techniques 
and we started from scratch in wea- 
pon building." 

"You face a busy day, Mr. Pres- 
ident," said Foote. "If there is 
nothing further you wish from 

us — " 

The President rose and came 
around the desk. He shook both his 
visitors by the hand. "Thanks for 
coming by,” he said. "This is 
something we must get busy on 
immediately." 

Wilson stood up to leave. "Do I 
call in the press immediately?” 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



135 




he asked. “Or should I wait until 
after you have talked with Sand- 
burg?” 

The President hesitated, con- 
sidering. “I should think right 
away,” he said. “I’d like us to be 
the first to tell them. The military 
has the lid clamped down, but it 
won’t stay clamped for long. Some 
of the people from the Hill are 
coming in to see me. It would be 
better if they knew about this be- 
fore they arrived.” 

“There’s another matter, 
said Wilson. “You were asleep 
and I didn’t want to wake you. 
There’s a dispatch case full of dia- 
monds — ” 

“Diamonds? What have dia- 
monds got todo with this?” 

“It’s a rather awkward busi- 
ness, sir,” said Wilson. “You re- 
call that case Gale was carry- 
ing—” 

“There were diamonds in that 
case?” 

“It was packed with sacks. He 
opened one sack and poured out 
diamonds on the desk. He told me 
the rest of the sacks also con- 
tained diamonds and I’m inclined 
to believe him. The refugees had 
the idea they could turn them over 
to us to pay whatever was laid out 
to send them back to the Mio- 
cene.” 

“I would like to have seen your 
face,” Henderson said, “when he 



poured out the diamonds. What, 
may I ask, did you do about it?” 

“I called in Jerry Black and put 
Gale under guard. I insisted he 
keep the diamonds.” 

“I guess that was all you could 
do. I think maybe I should call in 
the treasury people to take tem- 
porary custody and check with 
Reilly Douglas about the legality 
of all this. Did you get any idea 
how much the diamonds might be 
worth?” 

“Gale said, at present prices, 
perhaps billions of dollars. That 
is, if they can be fed into retail 
outlets slowly, without depres- 
sing the market. They’re not, you 
understand, for us alone, but for 
the entire world. Gale wants to 
leave them with us in trust as it 
were.” 

“You realize, of course, how 
sticky this could be if word leaked 
out?” 

“To be entirely fair,” said Wil- 
son, “we still must realize that 
they are only trying to be help- 
ful. They want to pay their way.” 
“Yes, I know,” said the Presi- 
dent. “We’ll have to see what 
Reilly says about it.” 

33 . The crowd had been gather- 
ing in Lafayette Park across the 
avenue from the White House 
since early morning. It was still the 
quiet and watchful group that had 



136 



IF 




stood the Sunday vigil, stolid in its 
watchfulness. But now there were 
a few placards and there had been 
none before. One of the placards, 
crudely lettered, read: back to 
the Miocene. Another read: 
bring on your sabertooths. 
Still another: let us leave this 
lousy world. 

A newsman pushed his way 
through the crowd, zeroing in on 
the whiskered youth who bore the 
back to the miocene placard. 

“Would you mind telling me,” 
he asked, “what is going on?” 

“Man,” said the youth, impa- 
tiently, “it is there for you to read. 
It says it loud and clear.” 

“It puzzles me,” said the news- 
man, “what you are trying to 
prove. Or don’t you have a point to 
make?” 

“No points this time,” the sign- 
carrier told him. “In the past we 
have tried to prove some points and 
have mostly gotten nowhere.’’ 
He made a thumb in the direction 
of the White House. “The man 
don’t listen too good. No one lis- 
tens too good.” 

“This time,” said a girl who 
stood beside the sign-carrier, 
“we’re not proving anything at 
all. We’re simply saying what we 
want to do and that’s go back to 
the Miocene.” 

“Or the Eocene,”-said another 
girl. “Or the Paleocene. Just any- 



where at all to get away from this 
scruffy place. We want to leave this 
crummy world and get another 
start. We want to go back and 
build the kind of world we want. 
We’ve been trying for years to 
change this society and we’ve got- 
ten exactly nowhere. And when 
we saw we couldn’t change it we 
tried to get out of it. That’s what 
the communes are all about. But 
the society won’t let us go. It 
reaches out and hauls us back. It 
will not let us go.” 

“Finally,” said the sign-carrier, 
“here’s a way to get shut of it. If 
these people from the future can 
travel to the past there’s no reason 
why we shouldn’t. There aren’t 
many people who would be sorry 
to see us go. Most of them would 
be glad,” 

“I suppose,” said the newsman, 
“that this could be called a move- 
ment. Most of the other things you 
people have done have been 
labeled movements. Would you 
mind telling me how many of 
you — ” 

“Not at all,” said the first girl. 
“Not more than fifteen or twenty 
of us now. But you write your story 
and let us get a news spot on tele- 
vision and there’ll be thousands of 
us. They’ll be coming from Chi- 
cago and New York, from Boston 
and Los Angeles. There’ll be more 
of us than this town can hold. Be-

cause, you see, this is the first real 
chance we’ve had to get away.” 
“That’s ail right,” the newsman 
said. “I can see your point. But 
how do you go about it? Storm 
across the street and pound on the 
White House door?” 

“If you mean,” said the sign-car- 
rier, “that no one will pay atten- 
tion to us, you may be right.'But 
twenty-four hours from now they’ll 
pay attention to us„ Forty-eight 
hours from now they’ll be out here 
in the street talking with us.” 

“But you realize, of course, there 
are no time tunnels yet. There may 
never be. Those will take materials 
and manpower.” 

“They got their manpower right 
here, mister. All anyone has got 
to do is ask. Hand us picks and 
shovels. Hand us wrenches. Hand 
us anything at all and tell us what 
to do. We’ll work until we drop. 
We’ll do anything to get away 
from here. We don’t want any pay 
for working — we don’t want any- 
thing at all except to be allowed 
to go.” 

“You tell them that,” said the 
second girl. “You put it just the 
way we say.” 

“We’re not out to kick up any 
trouble,” said the sign-carrier. 
“We don’t want to cause any fuss. 
We just want to let them know. 
This is the only way we can.” 

“We won’t ask anything if 



they’ll only let us leave,” said the 
first girl. “We would like some 
hoes and axes, maybe some pots 
and pans. But if they won’t give us 
anything we’ll go empty-handed.” 

“Prehistoric men. made out with 
stone,” said the sign-carrier. “If 
we have to we can do the same.” 

“Why stand there listening to 
them?” asked a burly individual 
with a cigar stuck in his mouth. 
“Hell, all they do is talk. They all 
are full, of crap. They don’t want to 
go anywhere. They just want to 
stir up trouble.” 

“You’re wrong,” said the man 
with the sign. “We mean exactly 
what we say. What makes you 
think we want to stay here with 
jerks like you?” 

The man with the cigar made a 
grab at the sign and one of the girls 
kicked him in the shin. His reach- 
ing fingers missed the sign. The 
carrier clunked him on the head 
with it. A man who had been stand- 
ing beside the man with the cigar 
hit the sign-carrier on the jaw. 

The scuffle exploded and the po- 
lice came in and broke it up. 

34 * Judy was 'at her desk. Notes 
were beginning to accumulate on 
the spindle. The lights on the con- 
sole were blinking. 

“You get any sleep?” asked Wil- 
son. 

She looked up at him. “A little. 



138 



IF 




I lay awake thinking, scared. It’s 
not good, is it, Steve?” 

“Not good,” he said. “It’s too 
big for us to handle. If it weren’t 
for the time element it wouldn’t be 
so bad. If we only had a little 
time.” 

She gestured toward the door 
leading to the lounge. “You won’t 
tell them that, will you?” 

He grinned. “No, I won’t tell 
them that.” 

“They’ve been asking when 
you’re going to see them.” 

“Fairly soon,” he said. 

“I might as well tell you,” she 
said. “No use waiting. I’m going 
home. Back to Ohio.” 

“But I need you here.” 

“You can get a girl from the 
secretarial pool. Couple of days 
and you won’t know the differ- 
ence.” 

“That’s not what I mean.” 

“I know what you mean. You 
need me to shack up with. It’s been 
like that for how long — six 
months? It’s this damn town. It 
makes everything dirty. Some- 
where else it might have worked for 
us. But it isn’t working here.” 
“Damn it, Judy,” he said, 
“what’s got into you? Because I 
didn’t come out last night—” 
“Partly that, perhaps. Not all 
that, of course. I • know why you 
had to stay. But it was so lonely 
and so many things had happened 



and I sat there thinking and got 
scared. I tried to call my mother 
and the lines were busy. A poor 
scared girl, for Christ’s sake, run- 
ning back to mama. But suddenly 
everything was different. I wasn’t a 
sleek, competent Washington hus- 
sy any longer — I was a kid in pig- 
tails in a little town deep in Ohio. 
It all started with my getting 
scared. Tell me honestly now — I 
had a right to be scared.” 

“You had a right, v he said 
soberly. “I’m scared myself. So is 
everyone.” 

“What’s going to happen to us?” 
“Damned if I know. But that 
isn't what we were talking about.” 
“Monsters running loose,” she 
said. “Too many mouths to feed. 
Everyone fighting one another 
or getting set to fight.” 

“We were talking about your go- 
ing to Ohio. I'm not going to ask 
you do you really mean it — be- 
cause I know you do. I suppose 
you're lucky to have a place to run 
to. Most of us have no place. I'd 
like to ask you to stay, but that 
would be unfair. What’s more, it 
would be selfish. But I still wish 
you would.” 

“I have a plane reservation,” she 
said. “With the phone tied up and 
all I was surprised to get one. The 
country's in a panic. In a time like 
this you get that terribly helpless 
feeling.” 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



139 




“You won’t like Ohio. Once you 
get there you won’t like it. If you’re 
scared in Washington, you’ll be 
scared in Ohio.” 

“I still am going, Steve. Come 
six-fifteen tonight I’ll be on that 
plane.” 

“There’s nothing I can say?” 

“There’s nothing you can say,” 
she said. 

“Then you’d better let the press 
in. I have some news for them.” 



35 . Senator Andrew Oakes 
hitched himself up slightly from 
the depths of the chair. “I’m not 
right sure, Mr. President,’’ he 
said, “that it’s wise to bring home 
all the troops. We need to keep our 
bases manned. And it seems to me 
we’re allowing ourselves to get 
flustered just a mite too soon. 
Some itty-bitty monsters raid a 
chicken coop out in West Virginia 
and we start bringing home the 
troops. It don’t scarcely seem 
right. And I’m not sure it was too 
smart, either, to tell the newsmen 
about these little monsters. We’ll 
get the country all up tight.” 

“Senator,” said Congressman 
Nelson Able, “I think you may 
have gotten your protocol some- 
what twisted. We were not invited 
here to decide whether the troops 
were to be brought back home, but 
rather to learn that they were be- 



ing brought back and to be told 
the reason for it.” 

“1 still believe, said Senator 
Oakes, “that President Hender- 
son would want to know our 
thoughts. He might not agree with 
them, but I think that he should 
hear them. 

“That's right, Andy,” said the 
President. “You know that 
through the years I have listened 
to you often and almost as often 
have been fascinated by what you 
had to say. Which is not to say I 
agreed with you. Most commonly 
I don’t.” 

“I am well aware of that,” said 
Oakes, “but it has not stopped me 
from saying what I think. And I 
think it’s plain damn foolishness 
to fly back the troops. It’s not go- 
ing to take the total strength of our 
military might to run down some 
little chicken-killing monsters.” 

“I think the point has been 
made,” said Senator Brian Dixon, 
“that the monsters will not stay lit- 
tle monsters. The only sensible way 
for us to tackle them is to run them 
down before there get to be any 
more of them and before they have 
a chance to grow,” 

“But how do we know,” per- 
sisted Oakes, “that they will really 
grow or increase in numbers? 
We’re taking the word of people 
who came scurrying back to us be- 
cause they couldn’t face them. And 



140 



IF 




they couldn't face them because 
they had let down their guard. 
They had no military and they had 
no weapons — " 

“Now, just a minute. Senator," 
protested Congressman Able. “It's 
all right for you to make your mili- 
tary speeches up on the Hill. You 
get a good press there and can im- 
press the public. .But this is just 
among ourselves. We won't be im- 
pressed." 

“Gentlemen," Henderson said, 
“as I see it, this is all beside the 
point. With all due deference to 
the Senator, the military will be 
brought back home. 1 1\ will be 
brought home because the secre- 
tary of defense and the chiefs of 
staff have told me the forces are 
needed here. We discussed mat- 
ters very thoroughly earlier in the 
day. The feeling was that we can- 
not take the chance of anything 
going wrong. We may be aiming 
at overkill, but that is better than 
negligence. It may be true that we 
have been given poor informa- 
tion by the people from the fu- 
ture, but I am not inclined to think 
so. They have faced the monsters 
for twenty years and it seems to me 
that they would know far more of 
them than we do. I have talked 
with members of the Academy of 
Sciences and they tell me that 
while the characteristics at- 
tributed to this life form may be 



unusual they do not go contrary 
to any established biological rule. 
So I don’t think you can say there 
has been any lack of responsibil- 
ity in the reaching of our de- 
cisions. Because of the press of cir- 
cumstances we have moved faster 
than we ordinarily would, but we 
simply haven’t got the time to go 
at any of this with due delibera- 
tion." 

Oakes did not reply, but settled 
back in his chair, grunting softly 
to himself. 

“There was a report of a mon- 
ster loose in the Congo,” said 
Congressman Wayne Smith. 
“Have you, sir, any further in- 
formation?" 

“None," Henderson said. “We 
can’t be sure one did get through. 
The reports are unreliable." 

“There has been no request for 
aid to hunt it down?" 

“No request,” said the 
President. “Nothing official at 
all." 

“How about the tunnels, sir? 
The news reports seem to be in 
some conflict. Some of them, we 
know, have closed, but I can’t seem 
to get a clear idea of what is going 
on." 

“You probably know as much as 
we do here, Wayne. Here at home 
the Virginia tunnel is closed, of 
course. Two more were closed 
without our intervention — one in 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



141 




Wisconsin, the other down in 
Texas. I suppose those were shut 
down by the people in the future 
when the monsters were moving 
too close. Either that or there were 
malfunctions. Otherwise all the 
tunnels in the United States still 
are operating.” 

' “Would you think that the two 
you mentioned as closing may 
have done so because all the peo- 
ple had come through? There has 
to be an end to all these people 
some time.” 

“We know the Wisconsin tunnel 
closed because of an attack at the 
other end. The last of the people 
who came through told us that. I' 
don’t know about the Texas clos- 
ing. But as to the implied ques- 
tion of all the people having come 
through — yes, I would hope that 
soon the tunnels would start clos- 
ing because they’ve done their 
job.” 

“Mr. President,” asked Senator 
Dixon, “what do you know about 
the practical side of tunnel build- 
ing? Can we build the tunnels so 
the people can go back into the 
past?” 

“I am told we can,” said the 
President. “Our physicists and 
engineers are working with 
refugee scientists and engineers 
right now. The refugees have 
picked out the sites where the tun- 
nels should be built. One en- 



couraging feature is that not as 
many tunnels need be built as were 
used in bringing these people 
here. There isn’t the immediate 
time pressure to get them all back 
into the Miocene. Also, as I un- 
derstand it, transportation can 
be used to get the people to tunnels 
several hundred miles away. The 
one problem is getting some tun- 
nels built and the people moving 
out before the refugees eat us out 
of house and home.” 

“The construction of the tun- 
nels, then, isn’t beyond our capa- 
bility? All we need is time, money 
and labor.” 

“That is right, Brian. Labor is 
no problem. The refugees repre- 
sent a huge and willing labor force 
and just an hour or so ago I had 
word from Terry Roberts that our 
labor peple will raise no objection 
to our using them on what must be 
viewed as a federal project. Terry 
assures me that unions will co- 
operate in every way. Money is a 
problem. Even should industry be 
as willing to go along with us as 
labor is a vast amount of retool- 
ing will be necessary before we 
can start fabricating the com- 
ponents for the tunnels. Ordinarily 
retooling is a time-consuming 
process and a costly one. The fact 
that we must get at it immediate- 
ly and around the clock makes it 
expensive beyond anything that 



142 



IF 




can be imagined. Next, the com- 
ponents themselves will be costly 
items. And the brunt of the work 
must be borne by the pre- 
dominantly industrial nations. 
We, Germany, Russia, France, 
Britain, China, Japan and a few 
others must build the com- 
ponents — not only for ourselves 
but for the rest of the world. And 
we must build enough tunnels for 
there to be a fairly consistent 
regional distribution when they 
go back to the Miocene. While the 
population of the future is not as 
great as ours, it still must be scat- 
tered. The building of a new 
civilization in the past would be 
defeated if we dumped too many 
people in one area. And we must 
also furnish the refugees with the 
tools, livestock and seed they will 
need to make a new beginning. 
Furnishing the tools is going to 
call for a significant industrial ca- 
pacity/’ 

“Have you talked with anyone 
in the industrial community?" 

“Not personally. Commerce is 
making some tentative ap- 
proaches to see what sort of reac- 
tion is forthcoming. I have no 
word as yet. But it seems to me 
there should be some positive 
reaction. 1 should be disap- 
pointed if there weren't." 

Oakes hunched up out of his 
chair. “Have you any idea yet, Mr. 



President, what all of this might 
cost? Any good round figure?" 

“No," Henderson said, “I 
haven't." 

“But it's going to be costly." 

“It is going to be costly." 

“Maybe a great deal more than 
the defense budget, which every- 
one seems so horrified about." 

“You want me to say it, of 
course — " Henderson smiled — 
“so I will. Yes, it is going to be 
more costly than the defense bud- 
get, many times more costly. It 
will be even more costly than a 
war. It may bankrupt the world — 
but what would you have us do? 
Go out and shoot down all the 
refugees? That would solve the 
problem. Is that a solution you 
would like?" 

Grumbling, Oakes let himself 
sink back into the chair. 

“One thing has occurred to me," 
said Able. “There is the possibility 
that no matter what it costs us we 
may get value received. The 
refugees come from a time period 
where many technological prob- 
lems have been worked out, new 
approaches have been developed. 
One thing that has been men- 
tioned is fusion power. We are no- 
where near that yet — it may take 
us years to get there. For us fusion 
power would be a great leap for- 
ward. I would assume that, in re- 
turn for what we propose to do for 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



143 




them, they’d be willing to acquaint 
us with the basics of their techno- 
logical advances.” 

“It would ruin us,” Oakes said 
wrathfully. “It would finish up the 
job they’ve started. Take fusion 
power — there, gentlemen, in the 
twinkling of an eye, the gas and oil 
and coal industries go down the 
drain.” 

“And,” said Able, “I suppose 
the medical profession as well — if 
these people could give us the cure 
for cancer.” 

Dixon said, “What the Con- 
gressman says is true. If we had 
the advantages of all their scien- 
tific and technological ad- 
vances — perhaps their social and 
political advances — we would be 
much better off than we are to- 
day. To whom, I wonder, would 
the new knowledge and principles 
belong? To the man who was able 
to acquire the information by 
whatever means? Or to his govern- 
ment? Or to the world at large? 
And if the last — how would the in- 
formation be handled or imple- 
mented? It seems to me that at best 
we would have many thorny prob- 
lems to work out.” 

Congressman Smith put in, 
“This is all speculation. Right now, 
it seems to me, we have two im- 
mediate problems. We have to dis- 
pose of the aliens and do whatever 
is possible to send our guests back 



to the Miocene. Is this the way 
you read it, Mr. President?” 
“Exactly,” Henderson said. 

“I understand, Oakes rum- 
bled, “that the Russian ambas- 
sador is coming over to have a 
pow-wow with you.” 

“You were not supposed to 
know that, Andy.” 

“Well, you know how it is, Mr. 
President. You stay up on the Hill 
long enough and you get a lot of 
pipelines. You get told things. 
Even what you’re not supposed to 
know.” 

“The ambassador’s visit is no 
secret,” Henderson said. “I have 
no idea why he’s coming, but we 
are trying to work closely with 
everyone. I have had phone con- 
versations with a number of 
heads of state. I take it that the am- 
bassador’s visit is no more than an 
extension of these talks.” 

“Perhaps,” said Oakes. “Per- 
haps. I just tend to get a mite 
nervous when the Russians be- 
come too interested in anything 
at all.” 

36 . There was something in the 
hazel thicket at the edge of the tiny 
cornfield— a vague sense of a 
presence, a tantalizing outline 
that never quite revealed itself. 
Something lurked there, waiting. 
Sergeant Gordy Clark was quite 
sure of that. Just how he knew he 



144 



IF 




could not be sure. But he was 
sure — or almost sure. Some in- 
stinct born out of hundreds of pa- 
trols into enemy country, some- 
thing gained through the sharp, 
hard objectivity that was neces- 
sary for an old soldier to keep him- 
self alive while others died — some- 
thing that he or no one else could 
define told him there was a lurker 
in the thicket. 

He lay silent, almost unbreath- 
ing, stretched out on the little 
ridge that rose above the cornfield, 
his rocket launcher steadied on an 
ancient, rotted log and the cross- 
hairs centered on the thicket. It 
could be a dog, he told himself, or 
a child, perhaps even nothing — but 
he could not bring himself to think 
it was nothing. 

The drooping sumac bush bent 
close above him, shielding him 
from the view of whatever might 
be in the thicket. He could hear the 
faint mutter of the mountain 
brook that ran just beyond the 
cornfield. And from the hollow 
between the hills, where the farm 
buildings were located, came the 
senseless cackling of a hen. 

There was no sign of any other 
member of the patrol. He knew 
several of them must be close, but 
they were being careful not to be- 
tray their presence. They were 
regulars, every one of them, and 
they knew their business. They 



could move through these woods 
like shadows. They would make no 
noise, disturb no bush or branch. 

The sergeant smiled grimly to 
himself. They were good men. He 
had trained them all. The captain 
thought himself the one who had 
trained them, but it had not been 
the captain. Sergeant Gordon 
Fairfield Clark had beaten their 
business into these men. They all 
hated him, of course, and he 
wanted it no other way. For out of 
hatred could sometimes come 
respect. Fear or respect, he 
thought — either one would serve. 
There were some, perhaps, who 
had cherished the fantasy of put- 
ting a bullet through his skull. 
They must have had oppor- 
tunities, but they had never done it. 
For they needed him, the sergeant 
told himself — although not real- 
ly him, of course, but the hatred 
they had for him. There was 
nothing like a good strong hatred 
to hold a man together. 

The farmer at the buildings in 
the hollow thought he had seen 
something. He couldn’t tell what it 
was, but it had been pretty awful 
from the glimpse he had gotten of 
it. A kind of thing he had never 
seen before. Something no man 
could imagine. The farmer had 
shivered as he talked. 

The thing in the thicket came out 
so fast that it seemed to blur. Then, 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



145 




as quickly as it had moved, it 
stopped. It stood in the little open 
space of ground between the 
thicket and the com. 

Sergeant Clark caught his breath 
and his guts turned over, but even 
so he moved the launcher to cen- 
ter the cross-hairs on the crea- 
ture’s great paunch and his finger 
began the steady squeeze. 

Then it was gone. The .cross- 
hairs centered on nothing except 
the ragged clump of brush beyond 
the cornfield’s edge. Clark didn’t 
stir. He lay looking through the 
sight, but his finger slacked off the 
trigger. 

The monster had not moved. He 
was sure of that. It had simply dis- 
appeared. One microsecond 
there — the next, gone. Nothing 
could move that fast. 

Sergeant Clark raised his head, 
levered himself to his knees. He 
wiped his face and was astonished 
to find that his hand came away 
greasy wet. He had not been aware 
that he was sweating. 

37. Fyodor Morozov was a good 
diplomat and a decent man, the 
two not being incompatible, and 
he hated what he had to do. Be- 
sides, he told himself, he knew 
Americans and his present errand 
simply would not work. It would, 
of course, embarrass them and 
point out their sins for all the world 



to see and, under ordinary cir- 
cumstances, he would not have 
been averse to this. But under 
present conditions, he knew, the 
Americans were in no position to 
observe the niceties of diplomatic 
games and there was no way to 
gauge reactions. 

The President was waiting for 
him when he was ushered in and 
beside Henderson as was to be ex- 
pected, stood Secretary of State 
Williams. The President was all 
open blandness, but Thornton 
Williams, Fyodor could see, was a 
somewhat puzzled man, al- 
though he was doing an excellent 
job of hiding what he felt. 

When they had "shaken hands 
and sat down the President opened 
the conversation. “It’s always 
good to see you, Mr. Am- 
bassador,” he said, “for any rea- 
son — or even for no reason. But 
tell me, is there something we can 
do for you?” 

“My government,” said Fyodor, 
“has asked me to confer with your 
government — as unofficially as 
our official positions can make 
possible — concerning a matter of 
security I would assume is of some 
concern to both of us — in fact, to 
everyone.” 

He paused and they waited for 
him to go on. They did not re- 
spond — they asked no questions. 
They were no help at all. 



146 



IF 




“It is the matter,” he said, “of 
the alien creature that escaped 
from the Congo tunnel. There is 
no question that it must be hunted 
down. Since the Congo does not 
have sufficient military or police 
forces to accomplish this, my 
government is offering to supply 
some troops and we are about to 
sound out both Britain and France 
and perhaps other nations as 
well to determine if they might 
want to contribute to a joint ex- 
peditionary force against the 
monster.” 

“Certainly, Ambassador Mor- 
ozov,” said Williams, “your gov- 
ernment does not feel compelled* 
to seek our permission to embark 
on so neighborly an undertaking. 

I would imagine that you are pre- 
pared to make guarantees that 
you’ll withdraw all forces after the 
alien has been taken.” 

“Of course we are.” 

“Then I fail to grasp your 
point.” 

“There is also, said Fyodor, 
“the matter of the aliens — or 
monsters — on your own territory. 
We are. prepared to make the 
same offer to you as we will make 
the Congo.” 

“You mean,” said the Presi- 
dent, amused, “that you would be 
willing to lend us some of your 
forces to hunt down the aliens?” 
“We would go, I think,” said 



the ambassador, “somewhat be- 
yond the word you use — willing. I 
would think that, unless you can 
guarantee absolute effectiveness 
in containing and disposing of 
the creatures, we might possibly 
insist. This is not a national mat- 
ter — the international com- 
munity is concerned. The in- 
vaders must be obliterated. If you 
can’t accomplish this, then you 
must accept any help that’s of- 
fered.” 

“You know, of course,” said 
Williams, “that we are bringing 
home our troops.” 

“I know that, Mr. Secretary, 
but the question is how quickly 
can you bring them home. Our 
military people estimate it will 
take you thirty days at least and 
that may not be fast enough. There 
also is the question of whether 
you have personnel enough to cov- 
er the required territory.” 

The President said, “I can as- 
sure you that we appreciate your 
concern.” 

“It is the position of my govern- 
ment,” said Fyodor, “that many 
more men would be placed on the 
ground — and more quickly — if 
you accepted the aid we offer — ” 

“Mr. Ambassador,” said the 
President, interrupting, “I am 
certain you know better than to 
come to us with such an impudent 
suggestion. Surely you are aware 



OUR CHILDREN'S CH ILDREN 



147 




that if there had been genuine good 
will on the part of your govern- 
ment a different approach would 
have been employed. There is no 
question in my mind that the sole 
purpose of this call is to em- 
barrass us. In that, of course, 
you’ve failed. We are not in the 
least embarrassed.” 

“I am delighted that you’re 
not,” said Fyodor, unruffled. 
“We thought it was only the decent 
thing to approach you first in 
private.” 

“I assume,” said Williams, “you 
mean you now will bring the mat- 
ter up before the U.N., where 
you’ll seek to embarrass us in 
public.” 

“You gentlemen,” said the am- 
bassador, “persist in placing a 
wrong interpretation on this mat- 
ter. It is true, of course, that our 
countries have had their differ- 
ences in the past. We have not al- 
ways seen exactly eye to eye. Un- 
der present circumstances, how- 
ever, the entire world needs to 
stand together. It is quite clear to 
us — if not to you — that solving the 
alien problem quickly is in the in- 
ternational interest and that it is 
your duty to accept such aid as 
may be needed. We should be re- 
luctant to report to the United 
Nations that you neglect your 
duty.” 

“We would not attempt,” said 



Williams stiffly, “to suggest what 
you might tell the U.N.” 

'“If you should decide to accept 
our offer,” said the ambassador, 
“it would be agreeable to us to 
leave the initiative with you. If you 
should ask other nations — per- 
haps Canada, Britain, France and 
us — to supply the additional 
forces that you need nothing has to 
be said about this conversation.” 

“I suppose,” Henderson said, 
“you will want to relay an answer 
to your government.” 

“We would imagine you might 
want to deliberate on its nature. 
The U.N. does not meet until to- 
morrow noon.” 

“And if we asked some of our 
friends among the community of 
nations to supply us troops and 
did not include your government 
among them you would be of- 
fended?” 

“I cannot answer that with any 
surety — but I would presume we 
might be.” 

“It seems to me,” Williams said, 
“that all of this is no more than of- 
ficial mischief-making. I have 
known you for some years and 
have held a high regard for you. 
You have been here among us for 
three years — or is it four? — and 
surely you have grown to know us 
in that length of time. I think that 
your heart may not be entirely in 
these proceedings.”

IF 




Fyodor Morozov rose slowly to 
his feet. “I have delivered the mes- 
sage from my government,” he 
said. “Thank you both for seeing 
me.” 



38 . In New York, Chicago and 
Atlanta, mobs hurled themselves 
against police lines. The signs read: 
we didn’t ask them to come. 
They read: we have little 
enough as it is. They read: we 
refuse to starve. The crowds 
threw stones, bricks, tin cans bat- 
tered into tin shinny pucks with 
cutting edges, plastic bags filled 
with garbage. The ghetto areas 
roiled with violence. Some 
died — many were injured. Bon- 
fires were kindled. Houses burned 
and when fire rigs tried to reach the 
blazes they were stopped by bar- 
ricades. Great areas were given 
over to looting. 

In little towns throughout the 
country grim-faced men talked on 
benches in front of general stores, 
at filling stations, feed stores, 
street corners, at coffee breaks in 
the corner drug store and while 
waiting their turns in barber 
shops. They said to one another: It 
don’t seem right, somehow. It 
don’t seem possible. It ain’t like 
the old days, when you knew what 
was going on. There ain’t no tell- 
ing these days what will happen 



next. Too much is new-fangled 
now. The old days are going fast. 
There is nothing left for a man to 
hang to. 

They said judiciously: Of course 
if it is the way they say, we got to 
do our best for them. You heard 
the President say it last night. Chil- 
dren of our children. That’s what 
he said. Although I don’t know 
how we’re going to do it. Not with 
taxes what they are. We can’t pay 
no more taxes, and them tunnels 
are about to cost a mint. Taxes on 
everything you buy. On every- 
thing you do. On everything you 
own. Seems no matter how hard a 
man may scratch he can’t keep 
ahead of taxes. 

They said sanctimoniously: That 
preacher down in Nashville hit it 
on the head. If a man loses his re- 
ligion he has lost everything 
worthwhile. He has nothing left to 
live for. You lose the Good Book 
and you have lost it all. It don?t 
seem possible that even in five 
hundred years men would have 
given up their God. It’s the evil in 
the world today, right now, that’s 
made it possible. It’s big-city liv- 
ing. The meanness of it. Out here 
you could never lose your God. No, 
sir, He’s with you all the time. You 
feel Him in the wind. You see Him 
in the color of the eastern sky just 
before the break of dawn. You 
sense Him in the hush of evening. I 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



149 




feel sorry for these people from 
the future. I do feel purely sorry 
for them. They don’t know what 
they lost. 

They said angrily of the riots: 
Ought to shoot them down. I 
wouldn’t fool around with stuff like 
that. Not for a minute would I. 
Those people, some of them, ain’t' 
never done a lick of work in their 
entire lives. They just stand there 
with their hands out. You can’t tell 
me, if a man really wants to 
work — or a woman either — he or 
she can’t find a job. Out here we 
scratch and dig and sweat and we 
get next to nothing, but we don’t 
riot, we don’t burn, we don’t stand 
with hands out. 

They said of the young people 
with the signs in Lafayette Park: If 
they want to go to the Miocene or 
whatever this place is, why don’t 
we let them go? We won’t never 
miss them. We would be better off 
without them. 

The village banker said with 
ponderous judiciousness: Mark 
my word, we’ll be lucky if these fu- 
ture folks don’t ruin the entire 
country. Yes, sir, the entire coun- 
try — maybe the entire world. The 
dollar will be worth nothing and 
prices will go up. 

And inevitably some got around 
to whispering their blackest 
thoughts: You just wait and see. 
It’s a Commie plot, I tell you. A 



dirty Commie plot. I don’t know 
how they worked it, but when the 
wash comes out we’ll find these 
Russians at the bottom of it. 

There was marching in the land, 
a surge toward Washington by 
hitch-hiking, by bus, by old beat- 
up clunkers. An inward stream- 
ing of the counter-cultural young. 
Some of them reached the city be- 
fore the fall of night and marched 
with banners saying back to the 

MIOCENE — BRING ON THE SABER- 
TOOTHS! Others continued 
through the night or rested briefly 
in haystacks or on park benches, 
wolfing hamburgers, seeking out 
alliances, talking in hushed tones 
around campfires. 

In the streets of Washington 
bands formed around young men 
staggering under the weight of 
heavy crosses, stumbling and fall- 
ing, staggering up again to con- 
tinue on their way. Some wore 
crowns of thorns, blood trickling 
down their foreheads. Late in the 
afternoon a furious fight broke out 
in Lafayette Park when an in- 
dignant crowd, among them many 
of the hopefully Miocene-bound 
youngsters, moved to stop a 
crucifixion, with the victim al- 
ready lashed to the cross and the 
hole half dug for its planting. 
Police charged in and after a 
bloody fifteen minutes cleared the 
park. When this was over four 



150 



IF 




crudely fashioned crosses were 
gathered up and carted off. 

“These kids are crazy," said one 
panting officer. “I wouldn't give 
you a dime for the whole lot of 
them." 

Senator Andrew Oakes phoned 
Grant Wellington. “Now is the 
time," he said in a conspiratorial 
voice, “to lie low. Don't say a 
word. Don't even look as if you 
were interested. The situation, 
you might say, is fluid. Nothing is 
set. No one knows which way the 
cat will jump. But something is go- 
ing on. The Russian was at the 
White House this morning and that 
bodes no good for anyone. Some- 
thing we don't understand is very 
much afoot." 

Clinton Chapman phoned Reilly 
Douglas. “You know anything, 
Reilly?" 

“Nothing except that there real- 
ly is time travel and we have the 
blueprints for it." 

“You have seen the blueprints?" 

“No, 1 haven't. It's all under 
wraps. No one is saying anything. 
The scientists who talked with the 
future people aren't talking." 

“But you—" 

“I know, Clint. I'm the attorney 
general, but, hell, in a thing like 
this that doesn't count for any- 
thing. This is top secret. A few of 
the Academy crowd are in on it and 
that is all. Not even the mili- 



tary — and even if the military 
wanted it I have my doubts — " 

“But they have to let someone 
know. You can't build a thing un- 
til you know how. 

“The blueprints show how to 
build it, but that's all. Not what it 
really is. Not how it works. Not 
why it works. Not the principle." 

“What the hell difference does 
that make?" 

“I should think it would make 
some," said Douglas. “I, personal- 
ly, would be distrustful of build- 
ing something I didn't under- 
stand." 

“You say it is time travel. No 
doubt of that? It really is time 
travel 4 ? 1 " 

“No doubt at all," said Douglas. 

“Then there's a mint in it," said 
Chapman, “and I mean to — " 

“But if it only works one way." 

“It has to work both ways," said 
Chapman. “That's what my peo- 
ple tell me." 

“It will take a lot of financing," 
said Douglas. 

“I've talked to a lot of people," 
said Chapman. “People I can 
trust. They are interested. They 
see the possibilities. There'll be no 
lack of funds if we can put it 
through." 

Judy Gray got on the plane and 
found her seat. She looked out 
through the window, saw the 
scurrying trucks mistily and

quickly put up a hand to wipe her 
eyes. 

She said to herself, almost lov- 
ingly, through clenched teeth, “The 
son of a bitch. The dirty son of a 
bitch!” 

39 . Tom Manning spoke 
guardedly into the phone. “Steve, I 
have been hearing things.” 

“Put them on the wire, Tom,” 
said Wilson. “That’s why you are 
there. Put them on the wire for the 
glory days of dear old Global 
News.” 

“Now,” said Manning, “that 
you’ve had occasion to show off 
your shallow sense of humor, 
shall we get down to business?” 

“If this is a ploy,” said Wilson, 
“to trick me into confirmation of 
some rumor you have heard — 
you know it won’t work.” 

“You know me better than that, 
Steve.” 

“That’s the trouble. I do know 
you.” 

“All right, then,” said Man- 
ning, “if that’s the way of it let’s 
start at the beginning. The Presi- 
dent had the Russian ambassa- 
dor in this morning — ” 

“The President didn’t have him 
in. He came in on his own. The am- 
bassador made a statement to 
the press. You know about that.” 
“Sure, we know what the am- 
bassador said and what you said 



in this afternoon’s briefing, 
which, I might say, added very lit- 
tle light to the situation. But no 
one in town, no one in his right 
mind, that is, buys what either of 
you said.” 

“I’m sorry about that, Tom. I 
told all I knew.” 

“Okay,” said Manning. “I’ll 
take your word for that. It’s just 
possible that you weren’t told. But 
there’s a very nasty story being 
whispered at the U.N. in New 
York. At least it was whispered to 
our man there. I don’t know how 
much farther it has gone. Our man 
didn’t put it on the wire. He phoned 
me and I told him to hold it until I 
talked with you.” 

“I don’t have the least idea, 
Tom, ofwhat you’re talking about. 
I had honestly assumed the am- 
bassador told all that could be 
told. There have been some con- 
versations with Moscow and it 
sounded reasonable. The Presi- 
dent didn’t tell me differently. We 
mentioned it, I guess, but we 
didn’t talk about it. There were so 
many other things.” 

“All right, then,” said Man- 
ning, “here’s the stoYy as I heard it. 
Morozov talked to Williams and 
the President and offered troops 
to help hunt down the monsters 
and the offer was rejected.” 

“Tom, how good is your source? 
How sure are you of this?”

IF 




“Not sure at all. It's what our 
man at the U.N. was told this af- 
ternoon/’ 

“You’re talking about Max 
Hale. He’s your man up there.’’ 

“One of the best,” said Man- 
ning. “He’s fairly good at sorting 
out the truth.” 

“Yes, he is. I remember him 
from Chicago days.” 

“Hale’s informant told him 
that tomorrow the U.N. will be 
told of our refusal and a demand 
will be made that we be forced to 
admit troops from other nations. 
It’ll be said that we are negligent 
in not accepting them.” 

“The old squeeze play,” said 
Wilson. 

“And that’s not all of it. If other 
troops are not accepted and the 
aliens can’t he controlled — then, 
the U.N. will be told, the entire 
area must be nuclearly destroyed. 
The world can’t take chances.” 

“Wait a minute,” said Wilson, 
quickly. “You’re not putting this 
on the wires, you say?” 

“Not yet. Probably never. I 
hope never. That’s the reason I 
phoned. If Hale heard it there’s a 
likelihood someone else will hear 
it and, sure as God, it will get on a 
wire or be published somewhere.” 
“There’s no truth in it,” said 
Wilson. “I am sure of it. Christ, 
we’re all in this together. For the 
moment political power plays 
must be set aside. Tom, I simply 
OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



can’t believe this hearsay.” 

“You know nothing of this? Of 
any of it? There hasn’t been a 
breath?” 

“Not a breath,” said Wilson. 
“You know,” said Manning, “I 
wouldn’t have your job, Steve. Not 
for a million dollars.” 

“You’ll hold off, Tom. You’ll 
give us a little time to check.” 

“Of course. Until the pressure 
gets too great. Until someone 
else . I’ll let you know.” 

“Thanks, Tom. Some day — ” 
“Some day, when this is all 
over,” said Manning, “we’ll go off 
into some dark corner in an ob- 
scure bar where no one can pos- 
sibly find us and we’ll hang one 
on.” 

“I’ll stand the drinks,” said 
Wilson. 

He sat slumped after hanging 
up. Just when another day was 
about to end, he thought. But, hell, 
some days never ended. They just 
kept on and on. Yesterday and 
today had not been two days, but a 
nightmare-haunted eternity that 
seemed, when one thought of it, to 
have no reality at all. Judy gone. 
Kids marching in the street. The 
business community bitching be- 
cause it was prevented from using 
the economic disruption to go out 
and make a killing. Pulpit- 
thumping preachers hell-bent to

monsters running in the hills and 
the future still emptying its 
humanity upon this moment in the 
time track. 

His eyelids slid down and stuck 
and he forced himself erect. He 
had to get some sleep tonight — he 
had to find the time to get some 
sleep. 

Mqybe Judy had had the right 
idea. Just get up and walk away 
from it. Although, he told himself 
quite honestly, there still re- 
mained the question of what she’d 
walked away from. He missed 
her — she had been gone no more 
than an hour or two and he was 
missing her. Quite suddenly he 
realized he’d been missing her all 
day. Even while she still had been 
here, be had been missing her. 
Maybe, he thought, he should 
have asked her once again to stay, 
but there hadn’t been time and he 
hadn’t known how to do it — at 
least how to do it gracefully. And 
you did things gracefully or you 
did them not at all. More than 
likely, had he known, she wouldn’t 
have listened to him. 

He picked up the phone. “Kim, 
you still there? I’ll need to see the 
President. It is rather urgent. The 
first chance you have to squeeze me 
in.” 

“It may be some time, Steve,” 
she said. “There is a cabinet 
meeting.” 



40 * Sergeant Gordon Fairfield 
Clark said to Colonel Eugene 
Dawson, “I had it in my sights and 
then it wasn’t there. It disap- 
peared. It went away. I’m sure it 
didn’t move. Like a cartoonist 
drawing something moving fast, 
lettering in a swish, but this was 
without a swish. When it dis- 
appeared there wasn’t any motion. 
The first time I could see move- 
ment. But not when I had it in my 
sights. It didn’t move then. It 
didn’t blur.” 

“It saw you, Sergeant,” said the 
colonel. 

“I would think not, sir. I was 
well hidden. I kept still. I shifted 
the launcher barrel a couple of 
inches to aim it. That was all.” 

“It saw one of your men, then. 
It must have.” 

“Sir, I trained all those men my- 
self. No one sees them — no one 
hears them.” 

“It saw something or heard 
something. It sensed danger and 
disappeared. You’re sure about 
this disappearance, Sergeant? Ab- 
solutely?” 

'Colonel, I am sure.” 

Dawson was sitting on a fallen 
log. He reached down and picked 
up a small twig from the duff of the 
forest floor, began breaking it 
and rebreaking it. Clark squatted 
to one side, leaning on the 
launcher.

“Seargent," Dawson said, “I 
don’t know what the hell we’re go- 
ing to do about all this. I don’t 
know what the army's going to do. 
You find one of these things and 
before you can whap it, it is gone. 
We can handle them. I am sure of 
that. Even when they get big and 
rough and mean, like the people 
from the future say they will, we 
still can handle them. We’ve got 
the firepower. We have the sophis- 
tication. If they’d line up and 
come at us we could clobber them. 
But not when they're trying to 
keep clear of us and not in this kind 
of terrain. We could bomb ten 
thousand acres flat and get maybe 
one of them. God knows what else 
we’d kill, including people. We 
haven't the time or manpower to 
evacuate the people so that we can 
bomb. We’ve got to hunt these 
damned beasts down one by 
one — " 

“But even when we hunt them 
down, sir — " 

“Yes, I know." 

“Sir," said Sergeant Clark, 
“This is worse than Vietnam ever 
was. And Vietnam was hairy." 

The colonel stood up. “Nothing 
has ever beaten us all the way. 
These aliens won't either. But we 
have to find out how to kill them. 
All the firepower in the world, all 
the sophistication in the world is 
of no use until you can find some- 



thing to aim at long enough to pull 
the trigger.’’ 

Sergeant Clark rose to his feet, 
tucked the launcher under his arm. 
“Well, back to work,’’ he said. 

“Have you seen a photographer 
around here?" 

“A photographer? What 
photographer. I ain’t seen no 
photographer." 

“His name was Price. With 
some press association. He was 
messing around. I put the run on 
him.’’ 

“If I happen onto him," Ser- 
geant Clark said, “I’ll tie his tail in 
a knot." 



41 • Reverend Jake Billings was in 
conference with Ray MacDon- 
ald, formerly his assistant pub- 
lic relations manager, who had 
been appointed within the last 
twelve hours to the post of crusade 
operations chief. 

“I really do not think, Ray," 
said Billings, “that this business of 
crucifixion will advance our 
cause. It strikes me as being ra- 
ther crude and it could backlash. 
As one paper had to say of the at- 
tempt at Washington — " 

“You mean someone has al- 
ready gotten around to editorial- 
izing about it?" 

“The reaction has not been 
good." Billings spoke with unac- 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



155 




customed heat. “The editorial 
called it a cheap trick and a panty- 
waisted effort. The editorial be- 
came facetious in tone as it des- 
cribed the use of thongs, rather 
than nails in fastening the young 
man to the cross.” 

“But they were wrong,” 
MacDonald said. 

“You mean that you used 
nails?” 

“No. What I’m saying is that 
ordinarily the arms are tied, not 
nailed to the cross. We did some re- 
search on it — ” 

“Your research is no concern 
of mine,” said Billings icily. 
“What 1 do care about is that you 
gave some smart-assed editorial 
writer a chance to poke fun at us. 
And in any case, I think the whole 
idea of a fake crucifixion stinks. 
You didn’t check with me. How 
come you didn’t check with me?” 

“You were busy, Jake. You told 
me to do my best. You told me I 
was the man who could come up 
with ideas and I did come up with 
ideas. 1 ’ 

“I also had a call from Steve 
Wilson,” Billings said. “He 
chewed me out. There is no doubt 
that official Washington — the 
White House at least — is solidly 
against us. When he gets around to 
it, Wilson will publicly brand us 
sensationalists. He brushed us 
off contemptuously in his press 



briefing this afternoon. That was 
before this silly crucifixion busi- 
ness. Next time around he'll blast 
us.” 

“But we have a lot of people 
with us. You go out to the coun- 
tryside, to the little towns — ” 

“Yes, I know. The rednecks. 
They’ll be for us, sure, but how 
long do you think it will take be- 
fore their opinion can have any 
impact? What about the influen- 
tial pastors in the big city churches? 
Can you imagine what the Rever- 
end Dr. Angus Windsor will tell 
his congregation and the news- 
papers and the world? He won't go 
along with solemn young men 
packing crosses through the street 
and getting crucified on a public 
square. For years I have tried to 
conduct my ministry with dig- 
nity and now it's been pulled down 
to the level of street brawling.” 
MacDonald protested. “We’ve 
used stunts before. Circus stuff. 
Show biz. They’re what you built 
the business on.” 

“But with restraint.” 

“Not too much restraint. Sky- 
writing and parades and miles of 
billboards—” 

“Legitimate advertising,” said 
Billings. “Honest advertising. A 
great American tradition. The 
mistake you made was to go out in 
the streets. You don’t know about 
the streets. You ran up against the 



156 



IF 




experts there. These Miocene 
kids know about the streets. They 
have been there — and have lived 
there. You had two strikes on you 
before you started out. What made 
you think you could compete with 
them?" 

"All right, then — what are we 
going to do? The streets are out, 
you say. So we pull off the streets. 
Then what do we do? How do we 
get attention?" 

Reverend Jake Billings stared at 
the wall through glassy eyes. "I 
don’t know," he said. "I purely do 
not know. I don’t think it makes 
much difference what we do. I 
think that gurgling noise you hear 
is our crusade going down the 
drain." 

42 . It was the dog that did it. 
Bentley Price hadn't had a drink all 
day. The road was narrow, wind- 
ing across the mountain, and 
Bentley, exasperated beyond 
endurance at what had happened 
to him, was driving faster than he 
should. After hours of hunting for 
it, he had finally found the army 
camp — a temporary stopping 
point by the looks of it, with none 
of the meticulous neatness of the 
military. It huddled in a dense 
patch of woods beside a stream 
that came brawling down the val- 
ley. Filled with a deep sense of duty 
done and perseverance paying 



off, Bentley had slung cameras 
around his neck and plodded 
toward the largest of the tents. 
The colonel had come out to stop 
his further progress. Who the hell 
are you, the colonel had asked, 
and where do you think you’re go- 
ing? I’m from Global News. Bent- 
ley had told him, and I am out here 
to take some pictures of this mon- 
ster hunt. I tell the city editor it 
isn’t worth the time, but he disa- 
grees with me and it’s no skin off 
my nose no matter where I’m sent, 
so leave us get the lead out and do 
some monster hunting so 1 can' 
get some pictures. 

You’re off limits, mister, the col- 
onel had told him. You are way off 
limits, in more ways than one. I 
don’t know how you got this far. 
Didn’t someone try to stop you? 
Sure, said Bentley, up the road a 
ways. A couple of soldier boys. 
But I pay no attention to them. I 
never pay attention to someone 
who tries to stop me. I got work to 
do and I can’t fool around. 

And then the colonel had thrown 
him out of there. He had spoken in 
a clipped, military voice and hrad 
been very icy-eyed. We’ve got trou- 
ble enough, he said, without some 
damn fool photographer muck- 
ing around and screwing up the 
detail. If you don’t leave under 
your own power I’ll have you es- 
corted out. While he was saying 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



157 




' this, Bentley snapped up a camera 
and took a picture of him. That 
made the situation even worse and 
Bentley, with his usual quick per- 
ception, could see his cause had 
failed. He had beaten a dignified 
retreat to avoid escort. Some of 
the soldiers had called out to him 
derisively. Bentley had slowed 
down momentarily, debating 
whether to go back and reason 
with them, then had thought better 
of it. They ain’t worth the time, he 
had told himself. 

Now the dog. 

The dog came bursting out of 
high weeds and brush that grew 
along the road. Its ears were laid 
back. Its tail was tucked in and it 
was kiyodeling in pure, blind pan- 
ic. The dog was close and Bentley 
was traveling much too fast. He 
jerked the wheel. The car veered off 
the road, smashed through a clump 
of brush. The tires screamed as 
Bentley hit the brakes. The nose of 
the car slammed hard into a huge 
walnut tree and stopped with a 
shuddering impact. The left- 
hand door flew open and Bentley, 
who held a lofty disdain for such 
copouts as seat belts, was thrown 
free. The camera he wore on a 
strap around his neck described a 
short arc and brought up against 
his ear, dealing him a blow that 
made his head ring as if there were 
a bell inside it. He landed on his 



back and rolled, wound up on 
hands and knees. He surged erect 
and found that he had ended up on 
the berm of the road. 

Standing in the middle of the 
road was a monster. Bentley 
recognized it — he had seen two of 
them only yesterday. But this one 
was small, no bigger than a Shet- 
land pony. Which did not mean the 
horror of it was any less. 

But Bentley was of different fi- 
ber than were other men. He did 
not gulp. His gut did not turn over. 
His hands came up with swift pre- 
cision, grabbed the camera firm- 
ly, brought it to his eye. The mon- 
ster was framed in the finder and 
his finger pressed the button. The 
camera clicked and as it clicked 
the monster disappeared. 

Bentley lowered the camera and 
let loose of it. His head still rang 
from the blow upon the ear. His 
clothes were torn — a gaping rent 
in a trouser leg revealed one knob- 
by knee. His right hand was bloody 
from where his palm had scraped 
across some gravel. Behind him 
the car creaked slightly as twisted 
metal settled slowly into place. The 
motor pinged and’sizzled as water 
from the broken radiator ran 
across hot metal. 

Off in the distance the still-run- 
ning dog was yipping frantically. 
In a tree up the hillside an excited 
squirrel chattered with machine- 



158 



IF 




gun intensity. The road was em|5- 
ty. A monster had been there. 
From where he stood Bentley 
could see its tracks printed in the 
dust. But it was no longer there. 

He limped out into the road, 
stared up and down it. There was 
nothing on the road. 

It was there, Bentley said stub- 
bornly to himself. I had it in the 
finder. It was there when I shot the 
picture. It wasn't until the shut- 
ter clicked that it disappeared. 
Doubt assailed him. Had the beast 
been there or not when he'd shot 
the picture? Was it on the film? 
Had he been robbed of a photo by 
the animal's disappearance? 

Thinking about it, it seemed to 
him that the monster had been in 
his viewfinder when he triggered 
the camera, but suddenly he 
could not be sure. 

He turned about and started 
limping down the road as rapidly 
as he could. There was one way to 
find out. He had to get to a phone, 
get another car. He must get back 
to Washington. 

43 . “We have made three con- 
tacts with the monsters," Sand- 
burg said. “There are yet to be re- 
sults. No one has had a chance to 
fire at them. They simply van- 
ish." 

“You mean," said Thornton 
William, “that they duck away 



when threatened. Some people 
have made more permanent con- 
tact." 

“No, I don't mean that they 
duck," Sandburg said. “They just 
cease to be there. The soldiers who 
saw them swore they didn’t move 
at all. They were there and then 
they weren't^ The observers, all 
reporting independently, not 
knowing of the other reports, 
have made identical statements. 
One man could be wrong in his ob- 
servation — it's possible that two 
could be. It seems impossible 
that three observers could err on 
exactly the same point." 

“Have you, has the military, any 
theory, any idea of what is going 
on?" 

“None," said Sandburg. “It 
must be a new defensive adapta- 
tion that they have developed. 
These creatures are fighting for 
survival. Cornered, I suppose 
that they would fight, but only if 
they had no way out. And ap- 
parently they have come up with 
something new. We have talked 
with Dr. Isaac Wolfe, the refugee 
biologist who probably knows 
more about these aliens than any 
other man — and this business is 
something he has never heard of. 
He suggests, simply as a guess, 
that the vanishing act may be 
only a juvenile capability — de- 
fense mechanism for the young. It 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



159 




may have gone unobserved until 
now because Dr. Wolfe and his 
people have had little opportu- 
nity to observe the juveniles — 
they had their hands full fighting 
off the adult aliens.” 

“How are you doing with get- 
ting men into the area?” asked the 
President. 

“I haven’t any figures,” said 
Sandburg, “but we’re piling them 
in as fast as we can move them. 
The refugee camps have formed 
their own governing committees 
and that takes off some of the pres- 
sure, frees some troops. The agri- 
culture and welfare agencies are 
handling transportation of food 
and other necessities to the refu- 
gees and that, too, has freed mili- 
tary personnel. We expect the 
first overseas transport planes to 
begin landing some time tonight 
and that will give us more men to 
work with.” 

“Morozov was in this morn- 
ing,” said Williams, “with an of- 
fer to supply us men. In fact, he 
rather insisted upon it. We, of 
course, rejected the offer. But it 
does raise a point. Should we, per- 
haps, ask for some assistance from 
Canada, perhaps Mexico, maybe 
Britain, France, Germany — 
or from some of the other friendly 
powers?” 

“Possibly we could use some of 
their forces,” said Sandburg. “I’d 



like to talk with the chiefs of staff 
and get their reactions. What we 
need, and haven’t been able to 
manage, are some rather substan- 
tial forces for both north and 
south — down in Georgia and in 
upstate New York. We should try 
to seal off the aliens’ spread, if they 
are spreading — and I suppose 
that is their intention. If we can 
contain them we can handle 
them.” 

“If they stand still,” said the 
President. 

“That is right,” said Sandburg. 
“If they stand still.” 

“Maybe we should move on to 
something else,” Henderson sug- 
gested. “Reilly, I think you have 
something to report.” 

“I’m not yet too solid on this,” 
said Reilly Douglas, “but it’s a 
matter that should be discussed. 
Frankly, I am inclined to think 
there may be a rather tricky legal 
question involved and I’ve had no 
chance to go into that aspect of it. 
Clinton Chapman came to see me 
last night. I think most of you 
know Clint.” 

He looked around the table. 
Many of the men rtodded. 

“He came to me,” said Doug- 
las, “and since then has phoned 
three o four times and we had 
lunch today. I suppose some of 
you know that we were room- 
mates at Harvard and have been 



160 



IF 




friends ever since. I suppose that’s 
why he contacted me. On his first 
approach he proposed that he — 
himself — would take over the 
building of the tunnels, finan- 
cing the cost with no federal funds 
involved. In return he would con- 
tinue in ownership of them once 
the future people had been trans- 
ported back to the Miocene and 
would be licensed to operate 
them. Since then — ” 

“Reilly,”^Williams interrupted, 
“I can’t quite understand why 
anyone would want to own them. 
What in the world could be done 
with them? The time force, or 
whatever it is, as I understand it, 
operates in only one direction — 
into the past.” 

Douglas shook his head. “Clint 
won’t buy that. He has talked with 
his research people — and the 
staff he has is probably one of the 
best in the world — and they have 
assured him that if there is such a 
thing as time travel it can be made 
to operate both into the past and 
into the future. As a matter of 
fact, they tdld him it would seem 
easier to operate it forward than 
into the past because time’s nat- 
ural flow is into the future.” 

Williams blew out a gusty 
breath. “I don’t know,” he said. 
“It has a dirty sound to it. Could 
we conscientiously turn over 
two-way travel through time — if 



such travel were possible — to 
any one man or any group of men? 
Think of the ways it could be 
used — ” 

“I talked to Clint about this at 
lunch,” said Douglas. “I ex- 
plained to him that any such opera- 
tion, if it were possible, would 
have to be very strictly con- 
trolled. Commissions would have 
to be set up to formulate a code — 
Congress would have to legislate. 
Not only that, but the code and the 
legislation would have to be 
worldwide — there would have to 
be some international agree- 
ment and you can imagine how 
long that might take. Clint agreed 
to all of this, said he realized it 
would be necessary. The man is 
quite obsessed wjth the idea. As an 
old friend, I tried to talk him out of 
it, but he still insists he wants to go 
ahead. If he is allowed to do it, 
that is. At first he planned to fi- 
nance it on his own — but ap- 
parently he is beginning to real- 
ize the kind of money that would be 
involved. As I understand it, he is 
now very quietly trying to put to- 
gether a consortium to take over 
the project.” 

Sandburg frowned. “I would say 
no on impulse. The potentials 
would have to be studied closely.” 

“There could be military appli- 
cations,” said Williams. “I’m not 
just sure what they would be.” 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



161 




“International agreements, with 
appropriate safeguards, would 
have to be set up to keep it from be- 
ing used militarily,” said the 
President. “And if these agree- 
ments should fail at any time in the 
future, I can’t see that it would 
make much difference who held 
the license. National needs would 
always take precedence. No mat- 
ter how it goes, rapid movement 
'through time seems to be some- 
thing we’re stuck with. It’s some- 
thing we have to face — and make 
the best of.” 

“You favor Clint’s proposal, 
Mr. President?” Douglas asked 
in some surprise. “When I talked 
with you — ” 

“I wouldn’t go so far as to say I 
favored it,” Henderson said.. 
“But under the conditions we face 
it seems to me we should consider 
all possibilities or proposals. We 
are going to be hard pressed to 
find the kind of money or credit 
that is needed to build the tun- 
nels. Not only we, but the world. 
Perhaps the rest of the world con- 
fronts more difficulties than we.” 

“That brings us to another 
point,” said Williams. “I suppose 
Chapman and his consortium 
are proposing to construct only 
the tunnels in the United States.” 

“I don’t know the extent of his 
plans,” Douglas said. “I would 
guess that Chapman’s consorti- 



um might include some foreign 
money. I can’t see a country like 
the Congo or Portugal or Indo- 
nesia turning its back on someone 
who wants to build its tunnels. 
Other nations might be hesitant, 
but if we went along with the plan 
and a couple of the other major 
nations joined us — say Germany 
or France — most of the others 
would follow. Nobody would 
want to be left out.” 

“This is going to cost a lot of 
money,” Secretary of the Treas- 
ury Manfred Franklin put in. 
“Tunnels for the entire world 
would run into billions.” 

“There are gamblers in the fi- 
nancial world,” observed Ben 
Cunningham, of Agriculture. 
“But mostly theirs is what is 
known as smart money. Chapman 
must be fairly sure of his bets. Do 
you imagine he may know some- 
thing we don’t know?” 

Douglas shook his head. “I am 
inclined to think not. His RD 
people are good, but they’re only 
theorizing that time travel has to 
be a two-way street. Practical ap- 
plication so far says no. But even 
that is the first new’jdea — the first 
really . new idea with genuine tech- 
nological and engineering potential 
— that has come along in fifty 
years or more. Clint and his gang 
understandably want to get in on 
the ground floor.”

IF 




"‘The question,” said Williams, 
“is whether or not we should let 
them.” 

“Much as we may regret to do 
so,” said the President, “we may 
have to. Or word would be leaked 
to the public and you can imagine 
what the taxpayers’ reaction 
would be. Frankly, gentlemen, we 
may Find ourselves in a position 
where opposing the consortium 
would be political suicide.” 

“You don’t seem to be too upset 
about it,” Williams said some- 
what acidly. 

“When you have been in politics 
as long as I, Thornton, you don’t 
gag too easily at anything that 
comes up. You learn to be practi- 
cal. There are times when you 
simply cannot take potshots at 
Santa Claus.” 

“I still don’t like it,” said Wil- 
liams. 

“Nor do 1,” said Sandburg. 

“Letting Chapman go ahead 
would be a solution,” said Frank- 
lin. “Labor is ready to join us in 
the emergency. If the financial 
interests of the world would also 
go along — which is actually what • 
would happen under this consorti- 
um setup — our basics would be 
settled. We still have to feed the 
refugees, but I understand we 
can do that longer than we had 
thought at first. Supplying them 
with what they’ll need to establish 



themselves in their new start can 
be done at a fraction of the tunnel 
costs. Someone will have to do 
some rather rapid planning to 
calculate how much of our manu- 
facturing processes and re- 
sources will have to be converted 
for a time to the making of wheel- 
barrows, hoes, axes, plows and 
other similar items, but that’s 
simply a matter of computer 
time. The job may pinch us a bit, 
but it can be done. The tunnels are 
the big challenge and Chapman’s 
consortium will do the job there if 
we let them.” 

“How about all those banner- 
carrying kids who say they want to 
go back in time?” asked Cunning- 
ham. “I say let them go. It would 
clear the streets of them and for a 
long time a lot of people have been 
yelling about population pres- 
sure. We may have the answer 
here.” 

“You’re being facetious, of 
course,’’ said the President, 
“but—” 

“I can assure you, sir. I’m not in 
the least facetious. I mean it.” 

“And I agree with your main po- 
sition,’’ Henderson said. “My 
reasons may not be yours, but I do 
think we should not try to stop any- 
one who wants to leave us. But be- 
fore we allow them to go they 
must have the same ecological 
sense and convictions the future 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



163 




people have. We can’t send back 
people who’ll use up the resources 
we already have used. That would 
make a paradox I don’t pretend 
to understand, but I imagine it 
might be fatal to our civilization.” 
“Who would teach them this 
ecological sense and convic- 
tion?” 

“The refugees. They don’t all 
need to go back into the past im- 
mediately. In fact, they have of- 
fered to leave a group of special- 
ists with us who will teach us much 
of the knowledge of the next five 
hundred years — as much of it as 
we can assimilate. I think this of- 
fer should be accepted.” 

“So do I,” said Williams. 
“Some economic and social ap- 
plecarts will be upset, but in the 
long run we should be way out in 
front. In twenty years or less we 
could jump five hundred years 
ahead — without making the mis- 
takes our descendants on the old 
world line made.” 

“I don’t know about that,” said 
Douglas. “There are too many 
factors involved. I’d have to think 
about that for a while.” 

“We are forgetting one thing,” 
Sandburg said. “We can go ahead 
and plan, of course. And we have 
to do it fast. We have to be well 
along to a working solution in a 
month or so or time will begin 
running out. But the point I want 



to make is this — the solution, the 
planning may do us little good if 
we aren’t able to wipe out, or at 
least control, the aliens.” 

44 . The kids out in the street 
might be the ones, Wilson told 
himself, with the right idea. He 
could understand their fascina- 
tion with the concept of starting 
over once again — the slate wiped 
clean and the record clear. Only 
trouble was, he thought, that even 
starting over, the human race 
might still repeat many of its past 
mistakes — perhaps in some dif- 
ferent form. Then again, maybe 
not. It would take some time to 
make old errors and there would at 
least be the opportunity, if the 
will were there, to correct them 
before they got too big, too en- 
trenched and awkward. 

Alice Gale had talked about a 
wilderness where the White 
House once had stood and Dr. Os- 
borne, on the ride from Fort Myer 
to the White House, had expressed 
his doubt that the trend that had 
made the White House park a wil- 
derness could be stopped — it had 
gone too far, he had said. You are 
too top-heavy, h<s had said — you 
are off balance. 

Perhaps the trend had gone too 
far, Wilson admitted to him- 
self — big government w^s grow- 
ing bigger; big business was grow- 



164 



IF 




ing fatter and more arrogant; 
taxes were steadily rising, never 
going down; the poor were be- 
coming ever poorer and increas- 
ing in numbers despite the best in- 
tentions of a welfare-conscious 
society; the gap between the rich 
and poor, the government and the 
public was becoming wider by 
the year. How could it have been 
done differently, he wondered. 
Given the kind of world Earth was, 
how could circumstances have 
been better ordered? 

He shook his head. He had no 
idea. There might be men who 
could go back and chart the politi- 
cal, economic and social growth 
and show where the errors had 
been made, putting their fingers 
on certain actions in a certain 
year and saying here is where we 
made this error. But the men who 
could do this were theorists work- 
ing on the basis of ideas, many of 
which could not stand the test of 
application. 

The phone on his desk rang and 
he picked it up. 

“Mr. Wilson?" 

“Yes." 

“This is the guard at the south- 
west gate. There is a gentleman 
here who says that he must see you 
on a matter of importance. Mr. 
Thomas Manning. Mr. Bentley 
Price is with him. Do you know 
them, sir?" 



“Yes. Please send them in." 

“I'll send an escort with them, 
sir. You'll be in your office?" 

“Yes. I'll wait here for them." 

Wilson dropped the receiver 
back into its cradle. What could 
bring Manning here? Why should 
he have to come in person? A mat- 
ter of importance, he had said. 
And Bentley — for the love of 
God, why Bentley? 

Was it, he wondered, something 
further about the U. N. business? 

He looked at his watch. The 
cabinet meeting was taking long- 
er than he had thought it would. 
Maybe it was over and the Presi- 
dent had become busy with other 
matters. Although that would be 
strange — Kim ordinarily would 
have squeezed Steve in. 

Manning and Bentley came into 
the room. The guard stopped at the 
door. Wilson nodded at him. 

“It’s all right. You can wait out- 
side. This is an unexpected plea- 
sure," he said to the two, shaking 
their hands. “I seldom see you, 
Tom. And Bentley. I almost 
never see you." 

“I got business elsewhere," 
Bentley said. “I get my legs run 
off. I'm running all the time." 

“Bentley just got in from West 
Virginia," Manning said. “That's 
what this visit is about." 

"There was this dog in the 
road," said Bentley, “and then a 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



165 




nearby tree came up and hit me.” 

“Bentley took a picture of a 
monster standing in the road/’ 
said Manning, “just as it disap- 
peared.” 

“I got her figured now,” said 
Bentley. “It saw the camera 
pointed at it and it heard it click. 
Them monsters don’t stay around 
when they see something pointed 
at them.” 

“There have been other reports 
of their disappearing,” Wilson 
said. “A defense mechanism of 
some sort, perhaps. It’s making it 
tough for the boys out hunting 
them.” 

“I don’t think so,” said Man- 
ning. “Forcing them to disap- 
pear may be as good as hunting 
them.” 

He unzipped a thin briefcase he 
was carrying and took out a sheaf 
of photos. “Look at this,” he said. 

He slid the top photo across the 
desk to Wilson. 

Wilson took a quick look, then 
fixed his gaze on Bentley. “What 
kind of trick photography is 
this?” he asked. 

“There ain’t no tricks,” said 
Bentley. “A camera never lies. It 
always tells the truth. It shows you 
what is there. That’s what really 
happens when a monster disap- 
pears. I was using a fast film — ” 

“But dinosaurs!” yelled Wilson. 

Bentley’s hand dipped into his 



pocket and brought out an object. 
He handed it to Wilson. “A 
glass,” he said. “Take a look with 
it. There are herds of them off in 
the distance. You can’t do tricks 
of that sort.” 

The monster was hazed, a sort of 
shadow monster, but substan- 
tial enough for there to be no doubt 
it was an alien. Behind it the dino- 
saurs, three of them, were in sharp 
focus. 

“Duckbills,” said Manning. “If 
you showed that photograph to a 
paleontolqgist, I have every ex- 
pectation he could give you an ex- 
act identification.” 

The trees were strange. Some 
looked like palms, others like gi- 
gantic ferns. 

Wilson unfolded the magnifier, 
bent his head close above the pho- 
to, shifted the glass about. Bent- 
ley had been right. There were 
other strange creatures spread 
across the landscape, herds of 
them, singles, pairs. A small 
mammal of some sort cowered 
under a shrub. 

“We have some blowups,” Man- 
ning said, “of the background. 
Want to look at them?” 

Wilson shook his head. “No. I'm 
satisfied.” 

“We looked it up in a geology 
book, said Bentley. “That there 
is a Cretaceous landscape.” 

“Yes, I know,” said Wilson. 



166 



IF 




He reached for the phone. 
“Kim," he said, “is Mr. Gale in his 
room? Thank you. Please 'ask him 
to step down." 

Manning laid the rest of the pho- 
tos on the desk. “They are yours," 
he said. “We'll be putting them on 
the wire. We wanted you to know 
first. You thinking the same thing 
that I am?" 

Wilson nodded. “I suppose I 
am," he said, “but no quotation, 
please." 

“We don't need quotes," said 
Manning. “The picture tells the 
story. The monster, the mother 
monster, I would suppose you'd 
call it, was exposed to the time 
travel principle when it came 
through the tunnel. The principle 
was imprinted on its mind, its in- 
stinct, whatever you may call it. It 
transmitted knowledge of the 
principle to the young — a he- 
reditary instinct." 

“But it took time tunnels, me- 
chanical contraptions, for the 
humans to do it," Wilson ob- 
jected. “It took technology and 
engineering — " 

Manning shrugged. “Hell, 
Steve, I don't know. I don't pre- 
tend to know. But the photo says 
the monsters are escaping to an- 
other time. Maybe they'll all es- 
cape to another time, probably to 
the same time. The escape time 
bracket may be implanted on 



their instinct. Maybe the Creta- 
ceous is a better place for* them. 
Maybe they have found this era 
too tough for them to crack, the 
odds too great." 

“I just thought of something," 
said Wilson. “The dinosaurs died 
out—" 

“Yeah, I know," said Manning. 
He zipped the briefcase shut. “We 
better go," he said. “We have 
work to do. Thanks for seeing us." 

“No, Tom," said Wilson. “The 
thanks are to you and Bentley. 
Thanks for coming over. It might 
have taken days to get this puz- 
zled out. If we ever did — " 

He stood and watched them go, 
then sat down again. 

It was incredible, he thought. 
Yet it did make a lopsided sort of 
sense. Humans were too prone to 
think in human grooves. Aliens 
would be different. Again and 
again the refugees from the future 
had emphasized the creatures 
must not be regarded as simple 
monsters, but rather as highly in- 
telligent beings. And that intelli- 
gence, no doubt, would be as alien 
as their bodies. Their intelligence 
and ability would not duplicate 
human intelligence and ability. 
Hard as it might be to understand, 
they might be able to do by in- 
stinct what humans would need a 
machine to accomplish. 

Maynard Gale and Alice came 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



167 




into the room so quietly that he 
did not know they were there until 
he looked up and saw them stand- 
ing beside the desk. 

“You asked for us,” said Gale. 

“I wanted you to look at these,” 
said Wilson. “The top one first. 
The others are detail blowups. 
Tell me what you think.” 

He waited while they studied 
the photos. Finally Gale said, 
“This is the Cretaceous, Mr. Wil- 
son. How was the photo taken? 
And what has the monster to do 
with it?” 

“The photographer was taking a 
picture of the monster. As he 
took it — at the moment he took 
it — the monster disappeared.” 

“The monster disappeared?” 
“This is the second — or third or 
fourth — report of one disap- 
pearing. The second that I know 
of. There may have been others. I 
don’t know.” 

“Yes,” said Gale, “I suppose 
that it is possible. They’re not like, 
us, you know. The one that came 
through the tunnel experienced 
time travel — an experience that 
would have lasted for only a frac- 
tion of a second. But that may 
have been enough.” He shuddered. 
“If that is true — if after such an 
exposure they are able to travel 
independently in time, if their 
progeny is able to travel inde- 
pendently in time, if they can sense 



and learn and master such a com- 
plex thing so well, so quickly, it’s a 
wonder that we were able to stand 
up against them for these twenty 
years. They must have been play- 
ing with us, keeping us, protect- 
ing us for their sport. A game pre- 
serve. That is what we must have 
been. A game preserve.” 

“You can’t be sure of that,” said 
Wilson. 

“No, I suppose not. Dr. Wolfe is 
the man you should consult about 
this. He would know. At least he 
could make an educated guess.” 

“But you have no doubt?” 

“None,” said Gale. “This could 
be a hoax?” 

Wilson shook his head. “Not 
Tom Manning. We know one an- 
other well. We worked on the Post , 
right here, together. We were 
drinking companions. We were 
brothers until this damn job came 
between us. Not that he has no 
sense of humor. But he wouldn’t 
use it in a thing like this. And Bent- 
ley? The camera is his god. He 
wouldn’t use it for an unworthy 
purpose. He lives and breathes his 
cameras. He bows down before 
them each night before he goes to 
bed.” 

“So we have evidence the aliens 
flee into the past — even as we 
fled.” 

“I think so,” said Wilson. “I 
wanted your opinion. You know 



168 



IF 




these creatures and we do not.” 
“You’ll still talk with Wolfe?” 
“Yes, we’ll do that.” 

“There is another matter, Mr. 
Wilson, that we have wanted to 
talk with you about. My daughter 
and I have talked it over and we are 
agreed,” 

“What is that?” asked Wilson. 
“An invitation,” said Gale. 
“We're not sure you will accept. 
Perhaps you won’t. We may even 
offend you with it. But many other 
people, I think, would accept the 
invitation. To many it would have 
a great attraction. I find it rather 
awkward to phrase it, but it is this: 
When we go back into the Mio- 
cene — if you wished to do so you 
would be welcome to go along 
with us. With our particular 
group. We should be glad to have 
you.” 

Wilson did not move. He tried to 
find words and could not. 

Alice said, “You were ourjirst 
friend, perhaps our only real 
friend. You arranged the matter 
of the diamonds. You have done 
so many things.” 

She stepped quickly around the 
desk,.* bent to kiss him on the 
cheek. 

“We do not need an answer 
now,” said Gale. “You will want to 
think about it. If you decide not to 
go with us we'll not speak of this 
again. The invitation, I think, is 



issued with the knowledge that in 
all probability, your people will 
be using the time tunnels to go 
back into an era some millions of 
years in the past. I have the feeling 
you will not be able to escape the 
crisis that overtook our ances- 
tors (I refer to you, of course) on 
the original time track.” 

“I don’t know,” said Wilson. “I 
honestly do not know. You will let 
me think about it.” 

“Certainly,” said Gale. 

Alice bent close, her words a 
whispers. “I do so hope you’ll de- 
cide to come with us,” she said. 

Then they were gone as silently 
and unobtrustively as they had 
come. 

Dusk was creeping into the 
room. In the press lounge a type- 
writer clicked hesitantly as the 
writer sought words. Against the 
wall the teletypes muttered 
querulously. One button on 
Judy’s phone console kept flash- 
ing — not Judy’s console any 
more, he thought. Judy was gone. 
The plane that was taking her to 
Ohio was already heading west- 
ward. 

Judy, he said to himself. For the 
love of God, what got into you? 
Why did you have to do it? 

He would be lonely without her, 
he knew. He had not known until 
now, he realized, how much she 
had kept him from feeling alone. 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



169 




She had not needed to be with 
him — the mere thought that she 
was somewhere nearby had been 
quite enough to bring gladness to 
his heart. 

She still would be near, he 
thought. Ohio was not far — in this 
day no place on Earth was distant. 
Phones still worked and letters 
went by mail, but there was a dif- 
ference now. He thought of how 
he might phrase a letter if he wrote 
to her, but he knew he would never 
write. 

The phone rang. Kim said, “The 
meeting’s over. He can see you 
now.’’ 

45 . “Thank you, Kim,’’ said 
Wilson. That he had asked to see

mind. So much had happened 
since. 

When he entered the office the 
President said, “I’m sorry you 
were kept waiting, Steve. There 
was so much that had to be talked 
over. What do you have?" 

Wilson grinned. “Nothing quite 
as grim as what I had when I tried 
to reach you earlier. I think the 
situation is better now. There was 
a rumor out of the U. N." 

“This Russian business?" 

“Yes, the Russian business. Tom 
Manning, phoned. His U. N. 
man — Max Hale, you know him?’’ 

“1 don’t think I’ve ever met him. 
I read him. He is sound." 

“Hale heard that the Russians 
would push for the international 
dropping of nuclear weapons on 
the areas where the monsters 
might be." 

“I had expected something of 
that sort," said the President. 
“They’d never be able to pull it 
off." 

“I think the question is academ- 
ic now anyhow," said Wilson. 
“These just came in." He laid the 
photos on the desk. "Bentley 
Price took the shot." 

“Price," said the President. “Is 
he the one — " 

“He's the one all the stories are 
about. Drunk a good part of the 
time, but a topnotch photogra- 
pher. The best there is." 



170 



IF 





The President studied the first 
photo, frowning. “Steve, I'm not 
sure I understand this." 

“There's a story that goes with 
it sir. It goes something like this — " 

The President listened closely, 
not interrupting. When Wilson 
finished he asked, “You really 
think that's the explanation, 
Steve?" 

“I'm inclined to think so, sir. So 
does Gale. He said we should talk 
with Wolfe. But there was no ques- 
tion in Gale's mind. All we have to 
do is keep pushing them. Push 
enough of them into the past and 
the rest will go. If there were more 
of them — if we had as few weap- 
ons as the people of five hundred 
years from now had when they first 
reached liarth — they probably 
would try to stay on here. We'd 
offer plenty of fighting, be worthy 
antagonists. But I think they may 
know when they are licked. And 
back in the Cretaceous, they'll 
still have worthy opponents. For- 
midable ones. Tyrannosaurus 
rex and all his relatives. The tri- 
ceratops. The coelurosaurs. The 
hunting dinosaurs. Hand-to-hand 
combat, face-to-face. They might 
like that better than what humans 
have to offer. More glory in it for 
them." 

The President sat thoughtfully 
silent. Then he said, “As I recol- 
lect, the scientists have never fig- 



ured out what killed off the dino- 
saurs. Maybe now we know." 

“That could be," said Wilson. 

Henderson reached for the call 
box, then pulled back his hand. 

“No," he said. “Fyodor Moro- 
zov is a decent sort of man. What 
he did this morning was in the line 
of duty— he had to carry out or- 
ders. No use phoning him. He’ll 
find out when the picture hits the 
street. So will the people at the 
U.N. I’d like to see their faces. I’d 
say it spikes their guns." 

“I would say so, sir," said Wil- 
son. “I’ll take no more of your 
time—’’ 

“Stay for a minute, Steve. 
There’s something you should 
know. A sort of precautionary 
knowledge. The question may 
come up and you should know how 
to field it. No more than a half- 
dozen of our people — all scient- 
ists — know this and they won’t 
talk. Neither will the future 
people. ^There is no record. State 
doesn't know. Defense doesn’t 
know." 

“I wonder, sir, if I should—’’ 

“I want you to know," said the 
President. “Once you hear it you 
are bound by the same secrecy as 
the others. You’ve heard of the 
Clinton Chapman proposal?" 

“I have heard of it. I don’t like 
it. The question came up this 
morning and I refused comment. 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN

Said it was only rumor and I had 
no knowledge of it.” 

“Neither do I like it,” said the 
President. “But as far as I am 
concerned he’s going to be en- 
couraged to go ahead. He thinks 
he can buy time travel — thinks he 
has it in his hand. He can fairly 
taste it. I have never seen a more 
obvious case of naked greed. I’m 
not too sure his great good friend, 
Reilly Douglas, may not have a 
touch of that same greed.” 

“But if it’s greed — ” 

“It’s greed, all right,” said the 
President. “But I know some- 
thing he doesn’t know and if I can 
manage it, he won’t know it until 
it’s too late to do him any good. 
And that is this: What the future 
people used was not time travel as 
we think of it — it is something 
else. It serves the same purpose, 
but it’s not time travel as tradi- 
tionally conceived. I don’t know 
if I can explain this too well, but it 
seems there is another universe, 
coexistent with ours. The people 
of the future know it’s there, but 
there is only one thing they really 
know about it. That is that the 
direction of time’s flow in the sec- 
ond universe is exactly the oppo- 
site of ours. Its future flows 
toward our past. The people of the 
future traveled into their past by 
hooking onto the future flow of 
this other universe — ” 



“But that means you can travel 
in only one direction.” 

“Exactly,” said the President. 

“It means that you can go into the 
past, but you can’t come back.” 

“If Chapman knew this the deal 
would be off.” 

“I suppose it would be. He’s not 
proposing to build the tunnels 
from patriotic motives. He’s been 
told, of course, that the tunnels 
work only one way, but he doesn’t 
know why. Do you think badly of 
me, Steve, for my deception — 
my calculated dishonesty?” 

“I’d think badly of you, sir, if 
there really were a chance for 
Chapman to do what he means to 
do and you did not stop him. This 
way, however the world gets help 
and the only ones who are hurt are 
men who, for once, will have over- 
reached themselves. No one will 
feel sorry for them.” 

“Some day,” Henderson said, 
“it will be known. Some day my 
dishonesty will catch up with 
me.” 

“When it does,” said Wilson, “a 
great guffaw will go around the 
world. You’ll be famous, sir. 
They’ll build statues of you.” 

The President smiled. “I hope 
so, Steve. I feel a little sneaky.” 
“One thing, sir,” said Wilson. 
“Just how tight is this secret of 
yours?” 

“I feel it’s solid,” said the Presi-

dent. “The people you brought up 
from Myer told our National 
Academy people — only three of 
them. The future scientists and 
the men who talked with them re- 
ported back to me. To me alone. 
By this time, I had gotten wind of 
Chapman’s deal and I asked them 
to say nothing. Only a few of the 
refugee scientists worked on the 
project that sent the people 
back — only a handful of them 
know what is actually involved. 
And, as it happens, they all are 
here in the United States. Some- 
thing like the diamonds. They all 
are here because they felt we were 
the one nation they could trust. 
The word has been passed along at 
Myer. The future scientists 
won’t talk. Neither will our men.” 
Wilson nodded. “It sounds all 
right. You mentioned the dia- 
monds. What became of them?” 
“We have accepted temporary 
custody. They are locked away. 
Later, after all of this is over, 
we’ll see what can be done with 
them. Probably discreet sales will 
dispose of them, with a suitable 
cover story provided. The money 
will be put in escrow for later dis- 
tribution to other nations.” 

Wilson rose and moved toward 
the door. Halfway there, he 
stopped and turned. “I’d say, Mr. 
President, that things are going 
very well.” 



“Yes,” said the President. “Af- 
ter a bad start events are moving 
well. There’s still a lot to do, but we 
are on the way.” 

Someone was at Judy’s desk 
when Wilson returned. The room 
was dark. There were only the 
flashing lights on the console and 
they were not being answered. 

“Judy?” Wilson asked hesitant- 
ly. “Judy, is that you?” Knowing 
that it couldn’t be, for by now she 
was probably landing in Ohio. 

“I came back,” said Judy. 4 T got 
on the plane and then got off again. 
I sat at the airport for hours, won- 
dering what to do. You are a son 
of a bitch, Steve Wilson, and you 
know you are. I don’t know why I 
got off the plane. Getting off, I 
don’t know why I came here.” 

He strode across the room and 
stood beside her. 

“But, Judy—” 

Judy pouted. “You never asked 
me Jo stay. You never really asked 
me.” 

“But I did. I asked you.” 

“You were noble about it. That’s 
the trouble with you. Noble. You 
never got down on your knees and 
begged me. And now my baggage 
is headed for Ohio and I — ” 

He reached down and lifted her 
from the chair, held her close. 

“It’s been a rough two days,” he 
said. “It’s time for the two of us to 
be going home.” •

The Dolphin. Those animals are real-

the story was out of the ordin-

yarn all the same. 

Keep up the good work. I'm about to 
read Doomship now — and I know you 
won't let me down. 

Will you? 

R. E. Grehan 
Memphis, Tenn. 

With a Fred Pohl/Jack Williamson 
collaboration? And you’re asking? 

Dear Mr. Jakobbson: 

The cover illustration of the April 
Worlds of If was the best I've seen in a 
long time — it was better than any of 
Brian Boyle's three Project 40 covers 
for Galaxy Magazine or most of his 
paintings up to now. Very, very 
good — have Mr. Boyle keep it up. 

The best feature in this issue was 
Doomship, another Pohl/ William- 
son masterwork, extensively fla- 
vored by Jack Williamson's whole- 
some and identifiable human char- 
acterizations — his most attractive 



trademark, I think. 

The Wizard of Anharitte, which re- 
ceived such heavy praise from Tony 
Lewis in Locus, was equal to the pre- 
vious parts published in If. 

Next Time and Call Me Proteus 
were also enjoyable. 

I'd like to suggest, though, that in- 
stead of running serial installments 
every month you forget about serials 
entirely and try to include a novella, 
a couple of novelettes and as many 
short stories as you can in each issue. 

In view of the competition you still 
have to try harder! And I'll be boost- 
ing you all the way. 

Lester Boutillier 
New Orleans, La. 

Good science fiction, the best we 
can find at any length in wordage, is 
what we’ve wanted and will continue 
to want for Galaxy/If — I -can say 
most emphatically and with total 
sincerity that I have never turned 
xlown for purely mechanical rea- 
sons a work of fiction that I’ve liked. 

You may see — if you look through 
back issues — that we often com- 
press type to get in all that we want. 
And sometimes departmental ma- 
terial or art work is squeezed. 

.Both If and Galaxy are, first of all, 
science fiction magazines. 

Competition is a lovely game and 
good fun and every criticism hurts 
and is noted. But every publication 
in the field should serve the field, hope- 
fully add to it. Perfection is beyond 
most of us— but the unforgivable 
lapse would be to be of disservice to 
the field, as mindless competition 
for its own sake would make us. 

We’re going to try harder — we al- 
ways do. But both If and Galaxy re- 
main open to all lengths of good, pre-

tions as to how we can best serve. 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson : 

I have been trying to locate a short 
story I read some years ago ( ten to fif- 
teen years — or more), but have been 
hampered by the fact that I don’t re- 
member the name of the author or of 
the magazine in which the story ap- 
peared. 

The title of the story was Native 
Problem and the plot ran as follows: 

A man named Danton claims a 
planet. This comes about because at 
the time of the story it is possible to 
reach any point in the galaxy in a short 
period of time through a faster-than - 
light drive — and the galaxy is filled 
{ relatively ) with uninhabited. 

Earthlike planets. 

He is transported to his planet and 
left to fend for himself. 

Shortly afterward another space- 
ship arrives, carrying a group of re- 
ligious pilgrims. The ship is of an- 
cient design, has no FTL drive and has 
been in transit for centuries. No one 
on the ship has even set foot on a plan- 
etary surface, but the group s proph- 
ets have designated Danton s world 
as their promised land. 

In the ensuing encounter with Dan- 
ton the pilgrims refuse to listen to his 
explanations for his presence, but 
insist on considering him merely 
one of the natives to be subdued 



and I or converted. 

How Danton ends up as " the last of 
the natives " with the pilgrims estab- 
lished on the planet is a hilarious 
comment on the peculiar blindness 
we know as bigotry. y 

If you or anyone on your staff is fa- 
miliar with this story, could you please 
jot down the name of the author or of 
the magazine in which the story ap- 
peared and send it to me in the en- 
closed envelope? 

Thank you.

by H.G. Wells
Chapter 1
Mr. Bedford Meets Mr. Cavor at Lympne
As I sit down to write here amidst the shadows of vine-leaves under the
blue sky of southern Italy, it comes to me with a certain quality of
astonishment that my participation in these amazing adventures of Mr.
Cavor was, after all, the outcome of the purest accident. It might have
been any one. I fell into these things at a time when I thought myself
removed from the slightest possibility of disturbing experiences. I had
gone to Lympne because I had imagined it the most uneventful place in the
world. "Here, at any rate," said I, "I shall find peace and a chance to
work!"
And this book is the sequel. So utterly at variance is destiny with all
the little plans of men. I may perhaps mention here that very recently I
had come an ugly cropper in certain business enterprises. Sitting now
surrounded by all the circumstances of wealth, there is a luxury in
admitting my extremity. I can admit, even, that to a certain extent my
disasters were conceivably of my own making. It may be there are
directions in which I have some capacity, but the conduct of business
operations is not among these. But in those days I was young, and my youth
among other objectionable forms took that of a pride in my capacity for
affairs. I am young still in years, but the things that have happened to
me have rubbed something of the youth from my mind. Whether they have
brought any wisdom to light below it is a more doubtful matter.
It is scarcely necessary to go into the details of the speculations that
landed me at Lympne, in Kent. Nowadays even about business transactions
there is a strong spice of adventure. I took risks. In these things
there is invariably a certain amount of give and take, and it fell to me
finally to do the giving reluctantly enough. Even when I had got out of
everything, one cantankerous creditor saw fit to be malignant. Perhaps you
have met that flaming sense of outraged virtue, or perhaps you have only
felt it. He ran me hard. It seemed to me, at last, that there was nothing
for it but to write a play, unless I wanted to drudge for my living as a
clerk. I have a certain imagination, and luxurious tastes, and I meant to
make a vigorous fight for it before that fate overtook me. In addition to
my belief in my powers as a business man, I had always in those days had
an idea that I was equal to writing a very good play. It is not, I
believe, a very uncommon persuasion. I knew there is nothing a man can do
outside legitimate business transactions that has such opulent
possibilities, and very probably that biased my opinion. I had, indeed,
got into the habit of regarding this unwritten drama as a convenient
little reserve put by for a rainy day. That rainy day had come, and I set
to work.
I soon discovered that writing a play was a longer business than I had
supposed; at first I had reckoned ten days for it, and it was to have a
pied-a-terre while it was in hand that I came to Lympne. I reckoned myself
lucky in getting that little bungalow. I got it on a three years'
agreement. I put in a few sticks of furniture, and while the play was in
hand I did my own cooking. My cooking would have shocked Mrs. Bond. And
yet, you know, it had flavour. I had a coffee-pot, a sauce-pan for eggs,
and one for potatoes, and a frying-pan for sausages and bacon--such was
the simple apparatus of my comfort. One cannot always be magnificent, but
simplicity is always a possible alternative. For the rest I laid in an
eighteen-gallon cask of beer on credit, and a trustful baker came each
day. It was not, perhaps, in the style of Sybaris, but I have had worse
times. I was a little sorry for the baker, who was a very decent man
indeed, but even for him I hoped.
Certainly if any one wants solitude, the place is Lympne. It is in the
clay part of Kent, and my bungalow stood on the edge of an old sea cliff
and stared across the flats of Romney Marsh at the sea. In very wet
weather the place is almost inaccessible, and I have heard that at times
the postman used to traverse the more succulent portions of his route with
boards upon his feet. I never saw him doing so, but I can quite imagine
it. Outside the doors of the few cottages and houses that make up the
present village big birch besoms are stuck, to wipe off the worst of the
clay, which will give some idea of the texture of the district. I doubt if
the place would be there at all, if it were not a fading memory of things
gone for ever. It was the big port of England in Roman times, Portus
Lemanis, and now the sea is four miles away. All down the steep hill are
boulders and masses of Roman brickwork, and from it old Watling Street,
still paved in places, starts like an arrow to the north. I used to stand
on the hill and think of it all, the galleys and legions, the captives and
officials, the women and traders, the speculators like myself, all the
swarm and tumult that came clanking in and out of the harbour. And now
just a few lumps of rubble on a grassy slope, and a sheep or two--and I.
And where the port had been were the levels of the marsh, sweeping round
in a broad curve to distant Dungeness, and dotted here and there with tree
clumps and the church towers of old medieval towns that are following
Lemanis now towards extinction.
That outlook on the marsh was, indeed, one of the finest views I have ever
seen. I suppose Dungeness was fifteen miles away; it lay like a raft on
the sea, and farther westward were the hills by Hastings under the setting
sun. Sometimes they hung close and clear, sometimes they were faded and
low, and often the drift of the weather took them clean out of sight. And
all the nearer parts of the marsh were laced and lit by ditches and
canals.
The window at which I worked looked over the skyline of this crest, and it
was from this window that I first set eyes on Cavor. It was just as I was
struggling with my scenario, holding down my mind to the sheer hard work
of it, and naturally enough he arrested my attention.
The sun had set, the sky was a vivid tranquillity of green and yellow, and
against that he came out black--the oddest little figure.
He was a short, round-bodied, thin-legged little man, with a jerky quality
in his motions; he had seen fit to clothe his extraordinary mind in a
cricket cap, an overcoat, and cycling knickerbockers and stockings. Why he
did so I do not know, for he never cycled and he never played cricket. It
was a fortuitous concurrence of garments, arising I know not how. He
gesticulated with his hands and arms, and jerked his head about and
buzzed. He buzzed like something electric. You never heard such buzzing.
And ever and again he cleared his throat with a most extraordinary noise.
There had been rain, and that spasmodic walk of his was enhanced by the
extreme slipperiness of the footpath. Exactly as he came against the sun
he stopped, pulled out a watch, hesitated. Then with a sort of convulsive
gesture he turned and retreated with every manifestation of haste, no
longer gesticulating, but going with ample strides that showed the
relatively large size of his feet--they were, I remember, grotesquely
exaggerated in size by adhesive clay--to the best possible advantage.
This occurred on the first day of my sojourn, when my play-writing energy
was at its height and I regarded the incident simply as an annoying
distraction--the waste of five minutes. I returned to my scenario. But
when next evening the apparition was repeated with remarkable precision,
and again the next evening, and indeed every evening when rain was not
falling, concentration upon the scenario became a considerable effort.
"Confound the man," I said, "one would think he was learning to be a
marionette!" and for several evenings I cursed him pretty heartily. Then
my annoyance gave way to amazement and curiosity. Why on earth should a
man do this thing? On the fourteenth evening I could stand it no longer,
and so soon as he appeared I opened the french window, crossed the
verandah, and directed myself to the point where he invariably stopped.
He had his watch out as I came up to him. He had a chubby, rubicund face
with reddish brown eyes--previously I had seen him only against the
light. "One moment, sir," said I as he turned. He stared. "One moment,"
he said, "certainly. Or if you wish to speak to me for longer, and it is
not asking too much--your moment is up--would it trouble you to
accompany me?"
"Not in the least," said I, placing myself beside him.
"My habits are regular. My time for intercourse--limited."
"This, I presume, is your time for exercise?"
"It is. I come here to enjoy the sunset."
"You don't."
"Sir?"
"You never look at it."
"Never look at it?"
"No. I've watched you thirteen nights, and not once have you looked at the
sunset--not once."
He knitted his brows like one who encounters a problem.
"Well, I enjoy the sunlight--the atmosphere--I go along this path,
through that gate"--he jerked his head over his shoulder--"and round--"
"You don't. You never have been. It's all nonsense. There isn't a way.
To-night for instance--"
"Oh! to-night! Let me see. Ah! I just glanced at my watch, saw that I had
already been out just three minutes over the precise half-hour, decided
there was not time to go round, turned--"
"You always do."
He looked at me--reflected. "Perhaps I do, now I come to think of it. But
what was it you wanted to speak to me about?"
"Why, this!"
"This?"
"Yes. Why do you do it? Every night you come making a noise--"
"Making a noise?"
"Like this." I imitated his buzzing noise. He looked at me, and it was
evident the buzzing awakened distaste. "Do I do that?" he asked.
"Every blessed evening."
"I had no idea."
He stopped dead. He regarded me gravely. "Can it be," he said, "that I
have formed a Habit?"
"Well, it looks like it. Doesn't it?"
He pulled down his lower lip between finger and thumb. He regarded a
puddle at his feet.
"My mind is much occupied," he said. "And you want to know why! Well, sir,
I can assure you that not only do I not know why I do these things, but I
did not even know I did them. Come to think, it is just as you say;
I never _have_ been beyond that field.... And these things annoy you?"
For some reason I was beginning to relent towards him. "Not annoy,"
I said. "But--imagine yourself writing a play!"
"I couldn't."
"Well, anything that needs concentration."
"Ah!" he said, "of course," and meditated. His expression became so
eloquent of distress, that I relented still more. After all, there is a
touch of aggression in demanding of a man you don't know why he hums on
a public footpath.
"You see," he said weakly, "it's a habit."
"Oh, I recognise that."
"I must stop it."
"But not if it puts you out. After all, I had no business--it's something
of a liberty."
"Not at all, sir," he said, "not at all. I am greatly indebted to you. I
should guard myself against these things. In future I will. Could I
trouble you--once again? That noise?"
"Something like this," I said. "Zuzzoo, zuzzoo. But really, you know--"
"I am greatly obliged to you. In fact, I know I am getting absurdly
absent-minded. You are quite justified, sir--perfectly justified. Indeed,
I am indebted to you. The thing shall end. And now, sir, I have already
brought you farther than I should have done."
"I do hope my impertinence--"
"Not at all, sir, not at all."
We regarded each other for a moment. I raised my hat and wished him a good
evening. He responded convulsively, and so we went our ways.
At the stile I looked back at his receding figure. His bearing had changed
remarkably, he seemed limp, shrunken. The contrast with his former
gesticulating, zuzzoing self took me in some absurd way as pathetic. I
watched him out of sight. Then wishing very heartily I had kept to my own
business, I returned to my bungalow and my play.
The next evening I saw nothing of him, nor the next. But he was very much
in my mind, and it had occurred to me that as a sentimental comic
character he might serve a useful purpose in the development of my plot.
The third day he called upon me.
For a time I was puzzled to think what had brought him. He made
indifferent conversation in the most formal way, then abruptly he came to
business. He wanted to buy me out of my bungalow.
"You see," he said, "I don't blame you in the least, but you've
destroyed a habit, and it disorganises my day. I've walked past here for
years--years. No doubt I've hummed.... You've made all that impossible!"
I suggested he might try some other direction.
"No. There is no other direction. This is the only one. I've inquired.
And now--every afternoon at four--I come to a dead wall."
"But, my dear sir, if the thing is so important to you--"
"It's vital. You see, I'm--I'm an investigator--I am engaged in a
scientific research. I live--" he paused and seemed to think. "Just over
there," he said, and pointed suddenly dangerously near my eye. "The house
with white chimneys you see just over the trees. And my circumstances are
abnormal--abnormal. I am on the point of completing one of the most
important--demonstrations--I can assure you one of the most important
demonstrations that have ever been made. It requires constant thought,
constant mental ease and activity. And the afternoon was my brightest
time!--effervescing with new ideas--new points of view."
"But why not come by still?"
"It would be all different. I should be self-conscious. I should think of
you at your play--watching me irritated--instead of thinking of my work.
No! I must have the bungalow."
I meditated. Naturally, I wanted to think the matter over thoroughly
before anything decisive was said. I was generally ready enough for
business in those days, and selling always attracted me; but in the first
place it was not my bungalow, and even if I sold it to him at a good price
I might get inconvenienced in the delivery of goods if the current owner
got wind of the transaction, and in the second I was, well--undischarged.
It was clearly a business that required delicate handling. Moreover,
the possibility of his being in pursuit of some valuable invention also
interested me. It occurred to me that I would like to know more of this
research, not with any dishonest intention, but simply with an idea
that to know what it was would be a relief from play-writing. I threw
out feelers.
He was quite willing to supply information. Indeed, once he was fairly
under way the conversation became a monologue. He talked like a man long
pent up, who has had it over with himself again and again. He talked for
nearly an hour, and I must confess I found it a pretty stiff bit of
listening. But through it all there was the undertone of satisfaction one
feels when one is neglecting work one has set oneself. During that first
interview I gathered very little of the drift of his work. Half his words
were technicalities entirely strange to me, and he illustrated one or two
points with what he was pleased to call elementary mathematics, computing
on an envelope with a copying-ink pencil, in a manner that made it hard
even to seem to understand. "Yes," I said, "yes. Go on!" Nevertheless I
made out enough to convince me that he was no mere crank playing at
discoveries. In spite of his crank-like appearance there was a force about
him that made that impossible. Whatever it was, it was a thing with
mechanical possibilities. He told me of a work-shed he had, and of three
assistants--originally jobbing carpenters--whom he had trained. Now,
from the work-shed to the patent office is clearly only one step. He
invited me to see those things. I accepted readily, and took care, by a
remark or so, to underline that. The proposed transfer of the bungalow
remained very conveniently in suspense.
At last he rose to depart, with an apology for the length of his call.
Talking over his work was, he said, a pleasure enjoyed only too rarely. It
was not often he found such an intelligent listener as myself, he mingled
very little with professional scientific men.
"So much pettiness," he explained; "so much intrigue! And really, when one
has an idea--a novel, fertilising idea--I don't want to be uncharitable,
but--"
I am a man who believes in impulses. I made what was perhaps a rash
proposition. But you must remember, that I had been alone, play-writing in
Lympne, for fourteen days, and my compunction for his ruined walk still
hung about me. "Why not," said I, "make this your new habit? In the place
of the one I spoilt? At least, until we can settle about the bungalow.
What you want is to turn over your work in your mind. That you have always
done during your afternoon walk. Unfortunately that's over--you can't get
things back as they were. But why not come and talk about your work to me;
use me as a sort of wall against which you may throw your thoughts and
catch them again? It's certain I don't know enough to steal your ideas
myself--and I know no scientific men--"
I stopped. He was considering. Evidently the thing, attracted him. "But
I'm afraid I should bore you," he said.
"You think I'm too dull?"
"Oh, no; but technicalities--"
"Anyhow, you've interested me immensely this afternoon."
"Of course it would be a great help to me. Nothing clears up one's ideas
so much as explaining them. Hitherto--"
"My dear sir, say no more."
"But really can you spare the time?"
"There is no rest like change of occupation," I said, with profound
conviction.
The affair was over. On my verandah steps he turned. "I am already greatly
indebted to you," he said.
I made an interrogative noise.
"You have completely cured me of that ridiculous habit of humming," he
explained.
I think I said I was glad to be of any service to him, and he turned away.
Immediately the train of thought that our conversation had suggested must
have resumed its sway. His arms began to wave in their former fashion.
The faint echo of "zuzzoo" came back to me on the breeze....
Well, after all, that was not my affair....
He came the next day, and again the next day after that, and delivered
two lectures on physics to our mutual satisfaction. He talked with an
air of being extremely lucid about the "ether" and "tubes of force," and
"gravitational potential," and things like that, and I sat in my other
folding-chair and said, "Yes," "Go on," "I follow you," to keep him
going. It was tremendously difficult stuff, but I do not think he ever
suspected how much I did not understand him. There were moments when I
doubted whether I was well employed, but at any rate I was resting from
that confounded play. Now and then things gleamed on me clearly for a
space, only to vanish just when I thought I had hold of them. Sometimes my
attention failed altogether, and I would give it up and sit and stare at
him, wondering whether, after all, it would not be better to use him as a
central figure in a good farce and let all this other stuff slide. And
then, perhaps, I would catch on again for a bit.
At the earliest opportunity I went to see his house. It was large and
carelessly furnished; there were no servants other than his three
assistants, and his dietary and private life were characterised by a
philosophical simplicity. He was a water-drinker, a vegetarian, and all
those logical disciplinary things. But the sight of his equipment settled
many doubts. It looked like business from cellar to attic--an amazing
little place to find in an out-of-the-way village. The ground-floor rooms
contained benches and apparatus, the bakehouse and scullery boiler had
developed into respectable furnaces, dynamos occupied the cellar, and
there was a gasometer in the garden. He showed it to me with all the
confiding zest of a man who has been living too much alone. His seclusion
was overflowing now in an excess of confidence, and I had the good luck to
be the recipient.
The three assistants were creditable specimens of the class of "handy-men"
from which they came. Conscientious if unintelligent, strong, civil, and
willing. One, Spargus, who did the cooking and all the metal work, had
been a sailor; a second, Gibbs, was a joiner; and the third was an
ex-jobbing gardener, and now general assistant. They were the merest
labourers. All the intelligent work was done by Cavor. Theirs was the
darkest ignorance compared even with my muddled impression.
And now, as to the nature of these inquiries. Here, unhappily, comes a
grave difficulty. I am no scientific expert, and if I were to attempt to
set forth in the highly scientific language of Mr. Cavor the aim to which
his experiments tended, I am afraid I should confuse not only the reader
but myself, and almost certainly I should make some blunder that would
bring upon me the mockery of every up-to-date student of mathematical
physics in the country. The best thing I can do therefore is, I think to
give my impressions in my own inexact language, without any attempt to
wear a garment of knowledge to which I have no claim.
The object of Mr. Cavor's search was a substance that should be
"opaque"--he used some other word I have forgotten, but "opaque" conveys
the idea--to "all forms of radiant energy." "Radiant energy," he made me
understand, was anything like light or heat, or those Rontgen Rays there
was so much talk about a year or so ago, or the electric waves of Marconi,
or gravitation. All these things, he said, _radiate_ out from centres, and
act on bodies at a distance, whence comes the term "radiant energy." Now
almost all substances are opaque to some form or other of radiant energy.
Glass, for example, is transparent to light, but much less so to heat, so
that it is useful as a fire-screen; and alum is transparent to light, but
blocks heat completely. A solution of iodine in carbon bisulphide, on the
other hand, completely blocks light, but is quite transparent to heat. It
will hide a fire from you, but permit all its warmth to reach you. Metals
are not only opaque to light and heat, but also to electrical energy,
which passes through both iodine solution and glass almost as though they
were not interposed. And so on.
Now all known substances are "transparent" to gravitation. You can use
screens of various sorts to cut off the light or heat, or electrical
influence of the sun, or the warmth of the earth from anything; you can
screen things by sheets of metal from Marconi's rays, but nothing will cut
off the gravitational attraction of the sun or the gravitational
attraction of the earth. Yet why there should be nothing is hard to say.
Cavor did not see why such a substance should not exist, and certainly I
could not tell him. I had never thought of such a possibility before. He
showed me by calculations on paper, which Lord Kelvin, no doubt, or
Professor Lodge, or Professor Karl Pearson, or any of those great
scientific people might have understood, but which simply reduced me to a
hopeless muddle, that not only was such a substance possible, but that it
must satisfy certain conditions. It was an amazing piece of reasoning.
Much as it amazed and exercised me at the time, it would be impossible to
reproduce it here. "Yes," I said to it all, "yes; go on!" Suffice it for
this story that he believed he might be able to manufacture this possible
substance opaque to gravitation out of a complicated alloy of metals and
something new--a new element, I fancy--called, I believe, _helium_, which
was sent to him from London in sealed stone jars. Doubt has been thrown
upon this detail, but I am almost certain it was _helium_ he had sent him
in sealed stone jars. It was certainly something very gaseous and thin.
If only I had taken notes...
But then, how was I to foresee the necessity of taking notes?
Any one with the merest germ of an imagination will understand the
extraordinary possibilities of such a substance, and will sympathise a
little with the emotion I felt as this understanding emerged from the haze
of abstruse phrases in which Cavor expressed himself. Comic relief in a
play indeed! It was some time before I would believe that I had
interpreted him aright, and I was very careful not to ask questions that
would have enabled him to gauge the profundity of misunderstanding into
which he dropped his daily exposition. But no one reading the story of it
here will sympathise fully, because from my barren narrative it will be
impossible to gather the strength of my conviction that this astonishing
substance was positively going to be made.
I do not recall that I gave my play an hour's consecutive work at any time
after my visit to his house. My imagination had other things to do. There
seemed no limit to the possibilities of the stuff; whichever way I tried I
came on miracles and revolutions. For example, if one wanted to lift a
weight, however enormous, one had only to get a sheet of this substance
beneath it, and one might lift it with a straw. My first natural impulse
was to apply this principle to guns and ironclads, and all the material
and methods of war, and from that to shipping, locomotion, building, every
conceivable form of human industry. The chance that had brought me into
the very birth-chamber of this new time--it was an epoch, no less--was
one of those chances that come once in a thousand years. The thing
unrolled, it expanded and expanded. Among other things I saw in it my
redemption as a business man. I saw a parent company, and daughter
companies, applications to right of us, applications to left, rings and
trusts, privileges, and concessions spreading and spreading, until one
vast, stupendous Cavorite company ran and ruled the world.
And I was in it!
I took my line straight away. I knew I was staking everything, but I
jumped there and then.
"We're on absolutely the biggest thing that has ever been invented," I
said, and put the accent on "we." "If you want to keep me out of this,
you'll have to do it with a gun. I'm coming down to be your fourth
labourer to-morrow."
He seemed surprised at my enthusiasm, but not a bit suspicious or hostile.
Rather, he was self-depreciatory. He looked at me doubtfully. "But do you
really think--?" he said. "And your play! How about that play?"
"It's vanished!" I cried. "My dear sir, don't you see what you've got?
Don't you see what you're going to do?"
That was merely a rhetorical turn, but positively, he didn't. At first I
could not believe it. He had not had the beginning of the inkling of an
idea. This astonishing little man had been working on purely theoretical
grounds the whole time! When he said it was "the most important" research
the world had ever seen, he simply meant it squared up so many theories,
settled so much that was in doubt; he had troubled no more about the
application of the stuff he was going to turn out than if he had been a
machine that makes guns. This was a possible substance, and he was going
to make it! V'la tout, as the Frenchman says.
Beyond that, he was childish! If he made it, it would go down to posterity
as Cavorite or Cavorine, and he would be made an F.R.S., and his portrait
given away as a scientific worthy with Nature, and things like that. And
that was all he saw! He would have dropped this bombshell into the world
as though he had discovered a new species of gnat, if it had not happened
that I had come along. And there it would have lain and fizzled, like one
or two other little things these scientific people have lit and dropped
about us.
When I realised this, it was I did the talking, and Cavor who said, "Go
on!" I jumped up. I paced the room, gesticulating like a boy of twenty.
I tried to make him understand his duties and responsibilities in the
matter--_our_ duties and responsibilities in the matter. I assured him we
might make wealth enough to work any sort of social revolution we fancied,
we might own and order the whole world. I told him of companies and
patents, and the case for secret processes. All these things seemed to
take him much as his mathematics had taken me. A look of perplexity came
into his ruddy little face. He stammered something about indifference to
wealth, but I brushed all that aside. He had got to be rich, and it was no
good his stammering. I gave him to understand the sort of man I was, and
that I had had very considerable business experience. I did not tell him
I was an undischarged bankrupt at the time, because that was temporary,
but I think I reconciled my evident poverty with my financial claims. And
quite insensibly, in the way such projects grow, the understanding of a
Cavorite monopoly grew up between us. He was to make the stuff, and I was
to make the boom.
I stuck like a leech to the "we"--"you" and "I" didn't exist for me.
His idea was that the profits I spoke of might go to endow research, but
that, of course, was a matter we had to settle later. "That's all right,"
I shouted, "that's all right." The great point, as I insisted, was to get
the thing done.
"Here is a substance," I cried, "no home, no factory, no fortress, no ship
can dare to be without--more universally applicable even than a patent
medicine. There isn't a solitary aspect of it, not one of its ten thousand
possible uses that will not make us rich, Cavor, beyond the dreams of
avarice!"
"No!" he said. "I begin to see. It's extraordinary how one gets new points
of view by talking over things!"
"And as it happens you have just talked to the right man!"
"I suppose no one," he said, "is absolutely _averse_ to enormous wealth.
Of course there is one thing--"
He paused. I stood still.
"It is just possible, you know, that we may not be able to make it after
all! It may be one of those things that are a theoretical possibility, but
a practical absurdity. Or when we make it, there may be some little
hitch!"
"We'll tackle the hitch when it comes." said I.
Chapter 2
The First Making of Cavorite
But Cavor's fears were groundless, so far as the actual making was
concerned. On the 14th of October, 1899, this incredible substance was
made!
Oddly enough, it was made at last by accident, when Mr. Cavor least
expected it. He had fused together a number of metals and certain other
things--I wish I knew the particulars now!--and he intended to leave
the mixture a week and then allow it to cool slowly. Unless he had
miscalculated, the last stage in the combination would occur when the
stuff sank to a temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit. But it chanced
that, unknown to Cavor, dissension had arisen about the furnace tending.
Gibbs, who had previously seen to this, had suddenly attempted to shift
it to the man who had been a gardener, on the score that coal was soil,
being dug, and therefore could not possibly fall within the province of
a joiner; the man who had been a jobbing gardener alleged, however, that
coal was a metallic or ore-like substance, let alone that he was cook.
But Spargus insisted on Gibbs doing the coaling, seeing that he was a
joiner and that coal is notoriously fossil wood. Consequently Gibbs
ceased to replenish the furnace, and no one else did so, and Cavor was
too much immersed in certain interesting problems concerning a Cavorite
flying machine (neglecting the resistance of the air and one or two
other points) to perceive that anything was wrong. And the premature
birth of his invention took place just as he was coming across the field
to my bungalow for our afternoon talk and tea.
I remember the occasion with extreme vividness. The water was boiling, and
everything was prepared, and the sound of his "zuzzoo" had brought me out
upon the verandah. His active little figure was black against the autumnal
sunset, and to the right the chimneys of his house just rose above a
gloriously tinted group of trees. Remoter rose the Wealden Hills, faint
and blue, while to the left the hazy marsh spread out spacious and serene.
And then--
The chimneys jerked heavenward, smashing into a string of bricks as they
rose, and the roof and a miscellany of furniture followed. Then overtaking
them came a huge white flame. The trees about the building swayed and
whirled and tore themselves to pieces, that sprang towards the flare. My
ears were smitten with a clap of thunder that left me deaf on one side for
life, and all about me windows smashed, unheeded.
I took three steps from the verandah towards Cavor's house, and even as I
did so came the wind.
Instantly my coat tails were over my head, and I was progressing in great
leaps and bounds, and quite against my will, towards him. In the same
moment the discoverer was seized, whirled about, and flew through the
screaming air. I saw one of my chimney pots hit the ground within six
yards of me, leap a score of feet, and so hurry in great strides towards
the focus of the disturbance. Cavor, kicking and flapping, came down
again, rolled over and over on the ground for a space, struggled up and
was lifted and borne forward at an enormous velocity, vanishing at last
among the labouring, lashing trees that writhed about his house.
A mass of smoke and ashes, and a square of bluish shining substance rushed
up towards the zenith. A large fragment of fencing came sailing past me,
dropped edgeways, hit the ground and fell flat, and then the worst was
over. The aerial commotion fell swiftly until it was a mere strong gale,
and I became once more aware that I had breath and feet. By leaning back
against the wind I managed to stop, and could collect such wits as still
remained to me.
In that instant the whole face of the world had changed. The tranquil
sunset had vanished, the sky was dark with scurrying clouds, everything
was flattened and swaying with the gale. I glanced back to see if my
bungalow was still in a general way standing, then staggered forwards
towards the trees amongst which Cavor had vanished, and through whose tall
and leaf-denuded branches shone the flames of his burning house.
I entered the copse, dashing from one tree to another and clinging to
them, and for a space I sought him in vain. Then amidst a heap of smashed
branches and fencing that had banked itself against a portion of his
garden wall I perceived something stir. I made a run for this, but before
I reached it a brown object separated itself, rose on two muddy legs, and
protruded two drooping, bleeding hands. Some tattered ends of garment
fluttered out from its middle portion and streamed before the wind.
For a moment I did not recognise this earthy lump, and then I saw that it
was Cavor, caked in the mud in which he had rolled. He leant forward
against the wind, rubbing the dirt from his eyes and mouth.
He extended a muddy lump of hand, and staggered a pace towards me. His
face worked with emotion, little lumps of mud kept falling from it. He
looked as damaged and pitiful as any living creature I have ever seen, and
his remark therefore amazed me exceedingly.
"Gratulate me," he gasped; "gratulate me!"
"Congratulate you!" said I. "Good heavens! What for?"
"I've done it."
"You _have_. What on earth caused that explosion?"
A gust of wind blew his words away. I understood him to say that it wasn't
an explosion at all. The wind hurled me into collision with him, and we
stood clinging to one another.
"Try and get back--to my bungalow," I bawled in his ear. He did not hear
me, and shouted something about "three martyrs--science," and also
something about "not much good." At the time he laboured under the
impression that his three attendants had perished in the whirlwind.
Happily this was incorrect. Directly he had left for my bungalow they had
gone off to the public-house in Lympne to discuss the question of the
furnaces over some trivial refreshment.
I repeated my suggestion of getting back to my bungalow, and this time he
understood. We clung arm-in-arm and started, and managed at last to reach
the shelter of as much roof as was left to me. For a space we sat in
arm-chairs and panted. All the windows were broken, and the lighter
articles of furniture were in great disorder, but no irrevocable damage
was done. Happily the kitchen door had stood the pressure upon it, so that
all my crockery and cooking materials had survived. The oil stove was
still burning, and I put on the water to boil again for tea. And that
prepared, I could turn on Cavor for his explanation.
"Quite correct," he insisted; "quite correct. I've done it, and it's all
right."
"But," I protested. "All right! Why, there can't be a rick standing, or a
fence or a thatched roof undamaged for twenty miles round...."
"It's all right--_really_. I didn't, of course, foresee this little upset.
My mind was preoccupied with another problem, and I'm apt to disregard
these practical side issues. But it's all right--"
"My dear sir," I cried, "don't you see you've done thousands of pounds'
worth of damage?"
"There, I throw myself on your discretion. I'm not a practical man, of
course, but don't you think they will regard it as a cyclone?"
"But the explosion--"
"It was not an explosion. It's perfectly simple. Only, as I say, I'm apt
to overlook these little things. It's that zuzzoo business on a larger
scale. Inadvertently I made this substance of mine, this Cavorite, in a
thin, wide sheet...."
He paused. "You are quite clear that the stuff is opaque to gravitation,
that it cuts off things from gravitating towards each other?"
"Yes," said I. "Yes."
"Well, so soon as it reached a temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit,
and the process of its manufacture was complete, the air above it, the
portions of roof and ceiling and floor above it ceased to have weight.
I suppose you know--everybody knows nowadays--that, as a usual thing,
the air _has_ weight, that it presses on everything at the surface of the
earth, presses in all directions, with a pressure of fourteen and a half
pounds to the square inch?"
"I know that," said I. "Go on."
"I know that too," he remarked. "Only this shows you how useless
knowledge is unless you apply it. You see, over our Cavorite this ceased
to be the case, the air there ceased to exert any pressure, and the air
round it and not over the Cavorite was exerting a pressure of fourteen
pounds and a half to the square in upon this suddenly weightless air. Ah!
you begin to see! The air all about the Cavorite crushed in upon the air
above it with irresistible force. The air above the Cavorite was forced
upward violently, the air that rushed in to replace it immediately lost
weight, ceased to exert any pressure, followed suit, blew the ceiling
through and the roof off....
"You perceive," he said, "it formed a sort of atmospheric fountain, a kind
of chimney in the atmosphere. And if the Cavorite itself hadn't been loose
and so got sucked up the chimney, does it occur to you what would have
happened?"
I thought. "I suppose," I said, "the air would be rushing up and up over
that infernal piece of stuff now."
"Precisely," he said. "A huge fountain--"
"Spouting into space! Good heavens! Why, it would have squirted all the
atmosphere of the earth away! It would have robbed the world of air! It
would have been the death of all mankind! That little lump of stuff!"
"Not exactly into space," said Cavor, "but as bad--practically. It would
have whipped the air off the world as one peels a banana, and flung it
thousands of miles. It would have dropped back again, of course--but on
an asphyxiated world! From our point of view very little better than if it
never came back!"
I stared. As yet I was too amazed to realise how all my expectations had
been upset. "What do you mean to do now?" I asked.
"In the first place if I may borrow a garden trowel I will remove some of
this earth with which I am encased, and then if I may avail myself of your
domestic conveniences I will have a bath. This done, we will converse more
at leisure. It will be wise, I think"--he laid a muddy hand on my arm--"if
nothing were said of this affair beyond ourselves. I know I have caused
great damage--probably even dwelling-houses may be ruined here and there
upon the country-side. But on the other hand, I cannot possibly pay for
the damage I have done, and if the real cause of this is published, it
will lead only to heartburning and the obstruction of my work. One cannot
foresee everything, you know, and I cannot consent for one moment to
add the burthen of practical considerations to my theorising. Later
on, when you have come in with your practical mind, and Cavorite is
floated--floated is the word, isn't it?--and it has realised all you
anticipate for it, we may set matters right with these persons. But not
now--not now. If no other explanation is offered, people, in the present
unsatisfactory state of meteorological science, will ascribe all this to a
cyclone; there might be a public subscription, and as my house has
collapsed and been burnt, I should in that case receive a considerable
share in the compensation, which would be extremely helpful to the
prosecution of our researches. But if it is known that _I_ caused this,
there will be no public subscription, and everybody will be put out.
Practically I should never get a chance of working in peace again. My
three assistants may or may not have perished. That is a detail. If they
have, it is no great loss; they were more zealous than able, and this
premature event must be largely due to their joint neglect of the furnace.
If they have not perished, I doubt if they have the intelligence to
explain the affair. They will accept the cyclone story. And if during the
temporary unfitness of my house for occupation, I may lodge in one of the
untenanted rooms of this bungalow of yours--"
He paused and regarded me.
A man of such possibilities, I reflected, is no ordinary guest to
entertain.
"Perhaps," said I, rising to my feet, "we had better begin by looking for
a trowel," and I led the way to the scattered vestiges of the greenhouse.
And while he was having his bath I considered the entire question alone.
It was clear there were drawbacks to Mr. Cavor's society I had not
foreseen. The absentmindedness that had just escaped depopulating the
terrestrial globe, might at any moment result in some other grave
inconvenience. On the other hand I was young, my affairs were in a mess,
and I was in just the mood for reckless adventure--with a chance of
something good at the end of it. I had quite settled in my mind that I was
to have half at least in that aspect of the affair. Fortunately I held my
bungalow, as I have already explained, on a three-year agreement, without
being responsible for repairs; and my furniture, such as there was of it,
had been hastily purchased, was unpaid for, insured, and altogether devoid
of associations. In the end I decided to keep on with him, and see the
business through.
Certainly the aspect of things had changed very greatly. I no longer
doubted at all the enormous possibilities of the substance, but I began to
have doubts about the gun-carriage and the patent boots. We set to work at
once to reconstruct his laboratory and proceed with our experiments. Cavor
talked more on my level than he had ever done before, when it came to the
question of how we should make the stuff next.
"Of course we must make it again," he said, with a sort of glee I had not
expected in him, "of course we must make it again. We have caught a
Tartar, perhaps, but we have left the theoretical behind us for good and
all. If we can possibly avoid wrecking this little planet of ours, we
will. But--there must be risks! There must be. In experimental work there
always are. And here, as a practical man, _you_ must come in. For my own
part it seems to me we might make it edgeways, perhaps, and very thin. Yet
I don't know. I have a certain dim perception of another method. I can
hardly explain it yet. But curiously enough it came into my mind, while I
was rolling over and over in the mud before the wind, and very doubtful
how the whole adventure was to end, as being absolutely the thing I
ought to have done."
Even with my aid we found some little difficulty, and meanwhile we kept at
work restoring the laboratory. There was plenty to do before it became
absolutely necessary to decide upon the precise form and method of our
second attempt. Our only hitch was the strike of the three labourers, who
objected to my activity as a foreman. But that matter we compromised after
two days' delay.
Chapter 3
The Building of the sphere
I remember the occasion very distinctly when Cavor told me of his idea of
the sphere. He had had intimations of it before, but at the time it seemed
to come to him in a rush. We were returning to the bungalow for tea, and
on the way he fell humming. Suddenly he shouted, "That's it! That
finishes it! A sort of roller blind!"
"Finishes what?" I asked.
"Space--anywhere! The moon."
"What do you mean?"
"Mean? Why--it must be a sphere! That's what I mean!"
I saw I was out of it, and for a time I let him talk in his own fashion. I
hadn't the ghost of an idea then of his drift. But after he had taken tea
he made it clear to me.
"It's like this," he said. "Last time I ran this stuff that cuts things
off from gravitation into a flat tank with an overlap that held it down.
And directly it had cooled and the manufacture was completed all that
uproar happened, nothing above it weighed anything, the air went squirting
up, the house squirted up, and if the stuff itself hadn't squirted up too,
I don't know what would have happened! But suppose the substance is loose,
and quite free to go up?"
"It will go up at once!"
"Exactly. With no more disturbance than firing a big gun."
"But what good will that do?"
"I'm going up with it!"
I put down my teacup and stared at him.
"Imagine a sphere," he explained, "large enough to hold two people and
their luggage. It will be made of steel lined with thick glass; it will
contain a proper store of solidified air, concentrated food, water
distilling apparatus, and so forth. And enamelled, as it were, on the
outer steel--"
"Cavorite?"
"Yes."
"But how will you get inside?"
"There was a similar problem about a dumpling."
"Yes, I know. But how?"
"That's perfectly easy. An air-tight manhole is all that is needed. That,
of course, will have to be a little complicated; there will have to be a
valve, so that things may be thrown out, if necessary, without much loss
of air."
"Like Jules Verne's thing in _A Trip to the Moon_."
But Cavor was not a reader of fiction.
"I begin to see," I said slowly. "And you could get in and screw yourself
up while the Cavorite was warm, and as soon as it cooled it would become
impervious to gravitation, and off you would fly--"
"At a tangent."
"You would go off in a straight line--" I stopped abruptly. "What is to
prevent the thing travelling in a straight line into space for ever?" I
asked. "You're not safe to get anywhere, and if you do--how will you get
back?"
"I've just thought of that," said Cavor. "That's what I meant when I said
the thing is finished. The inner glass sphere can be air-tight, and,
except for the manhole, continuous, and the steel sphere can be made in
sections, each section capable of rolling up after the fashion of a roller
blind. These can easily be worked by springs, and released and checked by
electricity conveyed by platinum wires fused through the glass. All that
is merely a question of detail. So you see, that except for the thickness
of the blind rollers, the Cavorite exterior of the sphere will consist of
windows or blinds, whichever you like to call them. Well, when all these
windows or blinds are shut, no light, no heat, no gravitation, no radiant
energy of any sort will get at the inside of the sphere, it will fly on
through space in a straight line, as you say. But open a window, imagine
one of the windows open. Then at once any heavy body that chances to be in
that direction will attract us--"
I sat taking it in.
"You see?" he said.
"Oh, I _see_."
"Practically we shall be able to tack about in space just as we wish. Get
attracted by this and that."
"Oh, yes. That's clear enough. Only--"
"Well?"
"I don't quite see what we shall do it for! It's really only jumping off
the world and back again."
"Surely! For example, one might go to the moon."
"And when one got there? What would you find?"
"We should see--Oh! consider the new knowledge."
"Is there air there?"
"There may be."
"It's a fine idea," I said, "but it strikes me as a large order all the
same. The moon! I'd much rather try some smaller things first."
"They're out of the question, because of the air difficulty."
"Why not apply that idea of spring blinds--Cavorite blinds in strong
steel cases--to lifting weights?"
"It wouldn't work," he insisted. "After all, to go into outer space is not
so much worse, if at all, than a polar expedition. Men go on polar
expeditions."
"Not business men. And besides, they get paid for polar expeditions. And
if anything goes wrong there are relief parties. But this--it's just
firing ourselves off the world for nothing."
"Call it prospecting."
"You'll have to call it that.... One might make a book of it perhaps," I
said.
"I have no doubt there will be minerals," said Cavor.
"For example?"
"Oh! sulphur, ores, gold perhaps, possibly new elements."
"Cost of carriage," I said. "You know you're not a practical man. The
moon's a quarter of a million miles away."
"It seems to me it wouldn't cost much to cart any weight anywhere if you
packed it in a Cavorite case."
I had not thought of that. "Delivered free on head of purchaser, eh?"
"It isn't as though we were confined to the moon."
"You mean?"
"There's Mars--clear atmosphere, novel surroundings, exhilarating sense
of lightness. It might be pleasant to go there."
"Is there air on Mars?"
"Oh, yes!"
"Seems as though you might run it as a sanatorium. By the way, how
far is Mars?"
"Two hundred million miles at present," said Cavor airily; "and you go
close by the sun."
My imagination was picking itself up again. "After all," I said,
"there's something in these things. There's travel--"
An extraordinary possibility came rushing into my mind. Suddenly I saw,
as in a vision, the whole solar system threaded with Cavorite liners
and spheres deluxe. "Rights of pre-emption," came floating into my
head--planetary rights of pre-emption. I recalled the old Spanish
monopoly in American gold. It wasn't as though it was just this planet
or that--it was all of them. I stared at Cavor's rubicund face, and
suddenly my imagination was leaping and dancing. I stood up, I walked
up and down; my tongue was unloosened.
"I'm beginning to take it in," I said; "I'm beginning to take it in." The
transition from doubt to enthusiasm seemed to take scarcely any time at
all. "But this is tremendous!" I cried. "This is Imperial! I haven't
been dreaming of this sort of thing."
Once the chill of my opposition was removed, his own pent-up excitement
had play. He too got up and paced. He too gesticulated and shouted. We
behaved like men inspired. We _were_ men inspired.
"We'll settle all that!" he said in answer to some incidental difficulty
that had pulled me up. "We'll soon settle that! We'll start the drawings
for mouldings this very night."
"We'll start them now," I responded, and we hurried off to the laboratory
to begin upon this work forthwith.
I was like a child in Wonderland all that night. The dawn found us both
still at work--we kept our electric light going heedless of the day. I
remember now exactly how these drawings looked. I shaded and tinted while
Cavor drew--smudged and haste-marked they were in every line, but
wonderfully correct. We got out the orders for the steel blinds and frames
we needed from that night's work, and the glass sphere was designed within
a week. We gave up our afternoon conversations and our old routine
altogether. We worked, and we slept and ate when we could work no longer
for hunger and fatigue. Our enthusiasm infected even our three men, though
they had no idea what the sphere was for. Through those days the man Gibbs
gave up walking, and went everywhere, even across the room, at a sort of
fussy run.
And it grew--the sphere. December passed, January--I spent a day
with a broom sweeping a path through the snow from bungalow to
laboratory--February, March. By the end of March the completion was in
sight. In January had come a team of horses, a huge packing-case; we
had our thick glass sphere now ready, and in position under the crane
we had rigged to sling it into the steel shell. All the bars and blinds
of the steel shell--it was not really a spherical shell, but polyhedral,
with a roller blind to each facet--had arrived by February, and the
lower half was bolted together. The Cavorite was half made by March, the
metallic paste had gone through two of the stages in its manufacture,
and we had plastered quite half of it on to the steel bars and blinds.
It was astonishing how closely we kept to the lines of Cavor's first
inspiration in working out the scheme. When the bolting together of
the sphere was finished, he proposed to remove the rough roof of the
temporary laboratory in which the work was done, and build a furnace
about it. So the last stage of Cavorite making, in which the paste is
heated to a dull red glow in a stream of helium, would be accomplished
when it was already on the sphere.
And then we had to discuss and decide what provisions we were to
take--compressed foods, concentrated essences, steel cylinders containing
reserve oxygen, an arrangement for removing carbonic acid and waste from
the air and restoring oxygen by means of sodium peroxide, water
condensers, and so forth. I remember the little heap they made in the
corner--tins, and rolls, and boxes--convincingly matter-of-fact.
It was a strenuous time, with little chance of thinking. But one day,
when we were drawing near the end, an odd mood came over me. I had been
bricking up the furnace all the morning, and I sat down by these
possessions dead beat. Everything seemed dull and incredible.
"But look here, Cavor," I said. "After all! What's it all for?"
He smiled. "The thing now is to go."
"The moon," I reflected. "But what do you expect? I thought the moon was
a dead world."
He shrugged his shoulders.
"We're going to see."
"Are we?" I said, and stared before me.
"You are tired," he remarked. "You'd better take a walk this afternoon."
"No," I said obstinately; "I'm going to finish this brickwork."
And I did, and insured myself a night of insomnia. I don't think I have
ever had such a night. I had some bad times before my business collapse,
but the very worst of those was sweet slumber compared to this infinity of
aching wakefulness. I was suddenly in the most enormous funk at the thing
we were going to do.
I do not remember before that night thinking at all of the risks we were
running. Now they came like that array of spectres that once beleaguered
Prague, and camped around me. The strangeness of what we were about to do,
the unearthliness of it, overwhelmed me. I was like a man awakened out of
pleasant dreams to the most horrible surroundings. I lay, eyes wide open,
and the sphere seemed to get more flimsy and feeble, and Cavor more unreal
and fantastic, and the whole enterprise madder and madder every moment.
I got out of bed and wandered about. I sat at the window and stared at
the immensity of space. Between the stars was the void, the unfathomable
darkness! I tried to recall the fragmentary knowledge of astronomy I had
gained in my irregular reading, but it was all too vague to furnish any
idea of the things we might expect. At last I got back to bed and snatched
some moments of sleep--moments of nightmare rather--in which I fell and
fell and fell for evermore into the abyss of the sky.
I astonished Cavor at breakfast. I told him shortly, "I'm not coming with
you in the sphere."
I met all his protests with a sullen persistence. "The thing's too mad,"
I said, "and I won't come. The thing's too mad."
I would not go with him to the laboratory. I fretted about my bungalow for
a time, and then took hat and stick and set out alone, I knew not whither.
It chanced to be a glorious morning: a warm wind and deep blue sky, the
first green of spring abroad, and multitudes of birds singing. I lunched
on beef and beer in a little public-house near Elham, and startled the
landlord by remarking apropos of the weather, "A man who leaves the world
when days of this sort are about is a fool!"
"That's what I says when I heerd on it!" said the landlord, and I found
that for one poor soul at least this world had proved excessive, and there
had been a throat-cutting. I went on with a new twist to my thoughts.
In the afternoon I had a pleasant sleep in a sunny place, and went on my
way refreshed. I came to a comfortable-looking inn near Canterbury. It
was bright with creepers, and the landlady was a clean old woman and took
my eye. I found I had just enough money to pay for my lodging with her. I
decided to stop the night there. She was a talkative body, and among many
other particulars learnt she had never been to London. "Canterbury's as
far as ever I been," she said. "I'm not one of your gad-about sort."
"How would you like a trip to the moon?" I cried.
"I never did hold with them ballooneys," she said evidently under the
impression that this was a common excursion enough. "I wouldn't go up in
one--not for ever so."
This struck me as being funny. After I had supped I sat on a bench by the
door of the inn and gossiped with two labourers about brickmaking, and
motor cars, and the cricket of last year. And in the sky a faint new
crescent, blue and vague as a distant Alp, sank westward over the sun.
The next day I returned to Cavor. "I am coming," I said. "I've been a
little out of order, that's all."
That was the only time I felt any serious doubt our enterprise. Nerves
purely! After that I worked a little more carefully, and took a trudge for
an hour every day. And at last, save for the heating in the furnace, our
labours were at an end.
Chapter 4
Inside the Sphere
"Go on," said Cavor, as I sat across the edge of the manhole, and looked
down into the black interior of the sphere. We two were alone. It was
evening, the sun had set, and the stillness of the twilight was upon
everything.
I drew my other leg inside and slid down the smooth glass to the bottom of
the sphere, then turned to take the cans of food and other impedimenta
from Cavor. The interior was warm, the thermometer stood at eighty, and as
we should lose little or none of this by radiation, we were dressed in
shoes and thin flannels. We had, however, a bundle of thick woollen
clothing and several thick blankets to guard against mischance.
By Cavor's direction I placed the packages, the cylinders of oxygen, and
so forth, loosely about my feet, and soon we had everything in. He walked
about the roofless shed for a time seeking anything we had overlooked, and
then crawled in after me. I noted something in his hand.
"What have you got there?" I asked.
"Haven't you brought anything to read?"
"Good Lord! No."
"I forgot to tell you. There are uncertainties-- The voyage may last--
We may be weeks!"
"But--"
"We shall be floating in this sphere with absolutely no occupation."
"I wish I'd known--"
He peered out of the manhole. "Look!" he said. "There's something
there!"
"Is there time?"
"We shall be an hour."
I looked out. It was an old number of _Tit-Bits_ that one of the men must
have brought. Farther away in the corner I saw a torn _Lloyd's News_. I
scrambled back into the sphere with these things. "What have you got?" I
said.
I took the book from his hand and read, "The Works of William
Shakespeare".
He coloured slightly. "My education has been so purely scientific--"
he said apologetically.
"Never read him?"
"Never."
"He knew a little, you know--in an irregular sort of way."
"Precisely what I am told," said Cavor.
I assisted him to screw in the glass cover of the manhole, and then he
pressed a stud to close the corresponding blind in the outer case. The
little oblong of twilight vanished. We were in darkness. For a time
neither of us spoke. Although our case would not be impervious to sound,
everything was very still. I perceived there was nothing to grip when the
shock of our start should come, and I realised that I should be
uncomfortable for want of a chair.
"Why have we no chairs?" I asked.
"I've settled all that," said Cavor. "We won't need them."
"Why not?"
"You will see," he said, in the tone of a man who refuses to talk.
I became silent. Suddenly it had come to me clear and vivid that I was a
fool to be inside that sphere. Even now, I asked myself, is to too late to
withdraw? The world outside the sphere, I knew, would be cold and
inhospitable enough for me--for weeks I had been living on subsidies from
Cavor--but after all, would it be as cold as the infinite zero, as
inhospitable as empty space? If it had not been for the appearance of
cowardice, I believe that even then I should have made him let me out. But
I hesitated on that score, and hesitated, and grew fretful and angry, and
the time passed.
There came a little jerk, a noise like champagne being uncorked in another
room, and a faint whistling sound. For just one instant I had a sense of
enormous tension, a transient conviction that my feet were pressing
downward with a force of countless tons. It lasted for an infinitesimal
time.
But it stirred me to action. "Cavor!" I said into the darkness, "my
nerve's in rags. I don't think--"
I stopped. He made no answer.
"Confound it!" I cried; "I'm a fool! What business have I here? I'm not
coming, Cavor. The thing's too risky. I'm getting out."
"You can't," he said.
"Can't! We'll soon see about that!"
He made no answer for ten seconds. "It's too late for us to quarrel now,
Bedford," he said. "That little jerk was the start. Already we are flying
as swiftly as a bullet up into the gulf of space."
"I--" I said, and then it didn't seem to matter what happened. For a time
I was, as it were, stunned; I had nothing to say. It was just as if I had
never heard of this idea of leaving the world before. Then I perceived an
unaccountable change in my bodily sensations. It was a feeling of
lightness, of unreality. Coupled with that was a queer sensation in the
head, an apoplectic effect almost, and a thumping of blood vessels at the
ears. Neither of these feelings diminished as time went on, but at last I
got so used to them that I experienced no inconvenience.
I heard a click, and a little glow lamp came into being.
I saw Cavor's face, as white as I felt my own to be. We regarded one
another in silence. The transparent blackness of the glass behind him made
him seem as though he floated in a void.
"Well, we're committed," I said at last.
"Yes," he said, "we're committed."
"Don't move," he exclaimed, at some suggestion of a gesture. "Let your
muscles keep quite lax--as if you were in bed. We are in a little
universe of our own. Look at those things!"
He pointed to the loose cases and bundles that had been lying on the
blankets in the bottom of the sphere. I was astonished to see that they
were floating now nearly a foot from the spherical wall. Then I saw from
his shadow that Cavor was no longer leaning against the glass. I thrust
out my hand behind me, and found that I too was suspended in space, clear
of the glass.
I did not cry out nor gesticulate, but fear came upon me. It was like
being held and lifted by something--you know not what. The mere touch of
my hand against the glass moved me rapidly. I understood what had
happened, but that did not prevent my being afraid. We were cut off from
all exterior gravitation, only the attraction of objects within our sphere
had effect. Consequently everything that was not fixed to the glass was
falling--slowly because of the slightness of our masses--towards the
centre of gravity of our little world, which seemed to be somewhere about
the middle of the sphere, but rather nearer to myself than Cavor, on
account of my greater weight.
"We must turn round," said Cavor, "and float back to back, with the things
between us."
It was the strangest sensation conceivable, floating thus loosely in
space, at first indeed horribly strange, and when the horror passed, not
disagreeable at all, exceeding restful; indeed, the nearest thing in
earthly experience to it that I know is lying on a very thick, soft
feather bed. But the quality of utter detachment and independence! I had
not reckoned on things like this. I had expected a violent jerk at
starting, a giddy sense of speed. Instead I felt--as if I were
disembodied. It was not like the beginning of a journey; it was like the
beginning of a dream.
Chapter 5
The Journey to the Moon
Presently Cavor extinguished the light. He said we had not overmuch
energy stored, and that what we had we must economise for reading. For a
time, whether it was long or short I do not know, there was nothing but
blank darkness.
A question floated up out of the void. "How are we pointing?" I said.
"What is our direction?"
"We are flying away from the earth at a tangent, and as the moon is
near her third quarter we are going somewhere towards her. I will open
a blind--"
Came a click, and then a window in the outer case yawned open. The sky
outside was as black as the darkness within the sphere, but the shape of
the open window was marked by an infinite number of stars.
Those who have only seen the starry sky from the earth cannot imagine its
appearance when the vague, half luminous veil of our air has been
withdrawn. The stars we see on earth are the mere scattered survivors that
penetrate our misty atmosphere. But now at last I could realise the
meaning of the hosts of heaven!
Stranger things we were presently to see, but that airless, star-dusted
sky! Of all things, I think that will be one of the last I shall forget.
The little window vanished with a click, another beside it snapped open
and instantly closed, and then a third, and for a moment I had to close my
eyes because of the blinding splendour of the waning moon.
For a space I had to stare at Cavor and the white-lit things about me to
season my eyes to light again, before I could turn them towards that
pallid glare.
Four windows were open in order that the gravitation of the moon might act
upon all the substances in our sphere. I found I was no longer floating
freely in space, but that my feet were resting on the glass in the
direction of the moon. The blankets and cases of provisions were also
creeping slowly down the glass, and presently came to rest so as to block
out a portion of the view. It seemed to me, of course, that I looked
"down" when I looked at the moon. On earth "down" means earthward, the way
things fall, and "up" the reverse direction. Now the pull of gravitation
was towards the moon, and for all I knew to the contrary our earth was
overhead. And, of course, when all the Cavorite blinds were closed, "down"
was towards the centre of our sphere, and "up" towards its outer wall.
It was curiously unlike earthly experience, too, to have the light coming
up to one. On earth light falls from above, or comes slanting down
sideways, but here it came from beneath our feet, and to see our shadows
we had to look up.
At first it gave me a sort of vertigo to stand only on thick glass and
look down upon the moon through hundreds of thousands of miles of vacant
space; but this sickness passed very speedily. And then--the splendour of
the sight!
The reader may imagine it best if he will lie on the ground some warm
summer's night and look between his upraised feet at the moon, but for
some reason, probably because the absence of air made it so much more
luminous, the moon seemed already considerably larger than it does from
earth. The minutest details of its surface were acutely clear. And since
we did not see it through air, its outline was bright and sharp, there was
no glow or halo about it, and the star-dust that covered the sky came
right to its very margin, and marked the outline of its unilluminated
part. And as I stood and stared at the moon between my feet, that
perception of the impossible that had been with me off and on ever since
our start, returned again with tenfold conviction.
"Cavor," I said, "this takes me queerly. Those companies we were going to
run, and all that about minerals?"
"Well?"
"I don't see 'em here."
"No," said Cavor; "but you'll get over all that."
"I suppose I'm made to turn right side up again. Still, _this_--
For a moment I could half believe there never was a world."
"That copy of _Lloyd's News_ might help you."
I stared at the paper for a moment, then held it above the level of my
face, and found I could read it quite easily. I struck a column of mean
little advertisements. "A gentleman of private means is willing to lend
money," I read. I knew that gentleman. Then somebody eccentric wanted to
sell a Cutaway bicycle, "quite new and cost 15 pounds," for five pounds;
and a lady in distress wished to dispose of some fish knives and forks, "a
wedding present," at a great sacrifice. No doubt some simple soul was
sagely examining these knives and forks, and another triumphantly riding
off on that bicycle, and a third trustfully consulting that benevolent
gentleman of means even as I read. I laughed, and let the paper drift from
my hand.
"Are we visible from the earth?" I asked.
"Why?"
"I knew some one who was rather interested in astronomy. It occurred to me
that it would be rather odd if--my friend--chanced to be looking through
some telescope."
"It would need the most powerful telescope on earth even now to see us as
the minutest speck."
For a time I stared in silence at the moon.
"It's a world," I said; "one feels that infinitely more than one ever did
on earth. People perhaps--"
"People!" he exclaimed. "No! Banish all that! Think yourself a sort of
ultra-arctic voyager exploring the desolate places of space. Look at it!"
He waved his hand at the shining whiteness below. "It's dead--dead! Vast
extinct volcanoes, lava wildernesses, tumbled wastes of snow, or frozen
carbonic acid, or frozen air, and everywhere landslip seams and cracks and
gulfs. Nothing happens. Men have watched this planet systematically with
telescopes for over two hundred years. How much change do you think they
have seen?"
"None."
"They have traced two indisputable landslips, a doubtful crack, and one
slight periodic change of colour, and that's all."
"I didn't know they'd traced even that."
"Oh, yes. But as for people--!"
"By the way," I asked, "how small a thing will the biggest telescopes show
upon the moon?"
"One could see a fair-sized church. One could certainly see any towns or
buildings, or anything like the handiwork of men. There might perhaps be
insects, something in the way of ants, for example, so that they could
hide in deep burrows from the lunar light, or some new sort of creatures
having no earthly parallel. That is the most probable thing, if we are to
find life there at all. Think of the difference in conditions! Life must
fit itself to a day as long as fourteen earthly days, a cloudless
sun-blaze of fourteen days, and then a night of equal length, growing
ever colder and colder under these cold, sharp stars. In that night
there must be cold, the ultimate cold, absolute zero, 273 degrees
Centigrade, below the earthly freezing point. Whatever life there is
must hibernate through that, and rise again each day."
He mused. "One can imagine something worm-like," he said, "taking its
air solid as an earth-worm swallows earth, or thick-skinned monsters--"
"By the bye," I said, "why didn't we bring a gun?"
He did not answer that question. "No," he concluded, "we just have to go.
We shall see when we get there."
I remembered something. "Of course, there's my minerals, anyhow," I said;
"whatever the conditions may be."
Presently he told me he wished to alter our course a little by letting the
earth tug at us for a moment. He was going to open one earthward blind
for thirty seconds. He warned me that it would make my head swim, and
advised me to extend my hands against the glass to break my fall. I did as
he directed, and thrust my feet against the bales of food cases and air
cylinders to prevent their falling upon me. Then with a click the window
flew open. I fell clumsily upon hands and face, and saw for a moment
between my black extended fingers our mother earth--a planet in a
downward sky.
We were still very near--Cavor told me the distance was perhaps eight
hundred miles and the huge terrestrial disc filled all heaven. But already
it was plain to see that the world was a globe. The land below us was in
twilight and vague, but westward the vast gray stretches of the Atlantic
shone like molten silver under the receding day. I think I recognised the
cloud-dimmed coast-lines of France and Spain and the south of England, and
then, with a click, the shutter closed again, and I found myself in a
state of extraordinary confusion sliding slowly over the smooth glass.
When at last things settled themselves in my mind again, it seemed quite
beyond question that the moon was "down" and under my feet, and that the
earth was somewhere away on the level of the horizon--the earth that had
been "down" to me and my kindred since the beginning of things.
So slight were the exertions required of us, so easy did the practical
annihilation of our weight make all we had to do, that the necessity for
taking refreshment did not occur to us for nearly six hours (by Cavor's
chronometer) after our start. I was amazed at that lapse of time. Even
then I was satisfied with very little. Cavor examined the apparatus for
absorbing carbonic acid and water, and pronounced it to be in satisfactory
order, our consumption of oxygen having been extraordinarily slight. And
our talk being exhausted for the time, and there being nothing further
for us to do, we gave way to a curious drowsiness that had come upon us,
and spreading our blankets on the bottom of the sphere in such a manner as
to shut out most of the moonlight, wished each other good-night, and
almost immediately fell asleep.
And so, sleeping, and sometimes talking and reading a little, and at times
eating, although without any keenness of appetite,[*] but for the most part
in a sort of quiescence that was neither waking nor slumber, we fell
through a space of time that had neither night nor day in it, silently,
softly, and swiftly down towards the moon.
[* Footnote: It is a curious thing, that while we were in the sphere we
felt not the slightest desire for food, nor did we feel the want of it when
we abstained. At first we forced our appetites, but afterwards we fasted
completely. Altogether we did not consume one-hundredth part of the
compressed provisions we had brought with us. The amount of carbonic acid
we breathed was also unnaturally low, but why this was, I am quite unable
to explain.]
Chapter 6
The Landing on the Moon
I remember how one day Cavor suddenly opened six of our shutters and
blinded me so that I cried aloud at him. The whole area was moon, a
stupendous scimitar of white dawn with its edge hacked out by notches of
darkness, the crescent shore of an ebbing tide of darkness, out of which
peaks and pinnacles came glittering into the blaze of the sun. I take it
the reader has seen pictures or photographs of the moon and that I need
not describe the broader features of that landscape, those spacious
ring-like ranges vaster than any terrestrial mountains, their summits
shining in the day, their shadows harsh and deep, the gray disordered
plains, the ridges, hills, and craterlets, all passing at last from a
blazing illumination into a common mystery of black. Athwart this world
we were flying scarcely a hundred miles above its crests and pinnacles.
And now we could see, what no eye on earth will ever see, that under the
blaze of the day the harsh outlines of the rocks and ravines of the
plains and crater floor grew gray and indistinct under a thickening
haze, that the white of their lit surfaces broke into lumps and patches,
and broke again and shrank and vanished, and that here and there strange
tints of brown and olive grew and spread.
But little time we had for watching then. For now we had come to the real
danger of our journey. We had to drop ever closer to the moon as we spun
about it, to slacken our pace and watch our chance, until at last we could
dare to drop upon its surface.
For Cavor that was a time of intense exertion; for me it was an anxious
inactivity. I seemed perpetually to be getting out of his way. He leapt
about the sphere from point to point with an agility that would have been
impossible on earth. He was perpetually opening and closing the Cavorite
windows, making calculations, consulting his chronometer by means of the
glow lamp during those last eventful hours. For a long time we had all our
windows closed and hung silently in darkness hurling through space.
Then he was feeling for the shutter studs, and suddenly four windows were
open. I staggered and covered my eyes, drenched and scorched and blinded
by the unaccustomed splendour of the sun beneath my feet. Then again the
shutters snapped, leaving my brain spinning in a darkness that pressed
against the eyes. And after that I floated in another vast, black silence.
Then Cavor switched on the electric light, and told me he proposed to bind
all our luggage together with the blankets about it, against the
concussion of our descent. We did this with our windows closed, because in
that way our goods arranged themselves naturally at the centre of the
sphere. That too was a strange business; we two men floating loose in that
spherical space, and packing and pulling ropes. Imagine it if you can! No
up nor down, and every effort resulting in unexpected movements. Now I
would be pressed against the glass with the full force of Cavor's thrust,
now I would be kicking helplessly in a void. Now the star of the electric
light would be overhead, now under foot. Now Cavor's feet would float up
before my eyes, and now we would be crossways to each other. But at last
our goods were safely bound together in a big soft bale, all except two
blankets with head holes that we were to wrap about ourselves.
Then for a flash Cavor opened a window moonward, and we saw that we were
dropping towards a huge central crater with a number of minor craters
grouped in a sort of cross about it. And then again Cavor flung our little
sphere open to the scorching, blinding sun. I think he was using the
sun's attraction as a brake. "Cover yourself with a blanket," he cried,
thrusting himself from me, and for a moment I did not understand.
Then I hauled the blanket from beneath my feet and got it about me and
over my head and eyes. Abruptly he closed the shutters again, snapped one
open again and closed it, then suddenly began snapping them all open, each
safely into its steel roller. There came a jar, and then we were rolling
over and over, bumping against the glass and against the big bale of our
luggage, and clutching at each other, and outside some white substance
splashed as if we were rolling down a slope of snow....
Over, clutch, bump, clutch, bump, over....
Came a thud, and I was half buried under the bale of our possessions, and
for a space everything was still. Then I could hear Cavor puffing and
grunting, and the snapping of a shutter in its sash. I made an effort,
thrust back our blanket-wrapped luggage, and emerged from beneath it. Our
open windows were just visible as a deeper black set with stars.
We were still alive, and we were lying in the darkness of the shadow of
the wall of the great crater into which we had fallen.
We sat getting our breath again, and feeling the bruises on our limbs. I
don't think either of us had had a very clear expectation of such rough
handling as we had received. I struggled painfully to my feet. "And now,"
said I, "to look at the landscape of the moon! But--! It's tremendously
dark, Cavor!"
The glass was dewy, and as I spoke I wiped at it with my blanket. "We're
half an hour or so beyond the day," he said. "We must wait."
It was impossible to distinguish anything. We might have been in a sphere
of steel for all that we could see. My rubbing with the blanket simply
smeared the glass, and as fast as I wiped it, it became opaque again with
freshly condensed moisture mixed with an increasing quantity of blanket
hairs. Of course I ought not to have used the blanket. In my efforts to
clear the glass I slipped upon the damp surface, and hurt my shin against
one of the oxygen cylinders that protruded from our bale.
The thing was exasperating--it was absurd. Here we were just arrived upon
the moon, amidst we knew not what wonders, and all we could see was the
gray and streaming wall of the bubble in which we had come.
"Confound it!" I said, "but at this rate we might have stopped at home;"
and I squatted on the bale and shivered, and drew my blanket closer about
me.
Abruptly the moisture turned to spangles and fronds of frost. "Can you
reach the electric heater," said Cavor. "Yes--that black knob. Or we
shall freeze."
I did not wait to be told twice. "And now," said I, "what are we to do?"
"Wait," he said.
"Wait?"
"Of course. We shall have to wait until our air gets warm again, and then
this glass will clear. We can't do anything till then. It's night here
yet; we must wait for the day to overtake us. Meanwhile, don't you feel
hungry?"
For a space I did not answer him, but sat fretting. I turned reluctantly
from the smeared puzzle of the glass and stared at his face. "Yes,"
I said, "I am hungry. I feel somehow enormously disappointed. I had
expected--I don't know what I had expected, but not this."
I summoned my philosophy, and rearranging my blanket about me sat down on
the bale again and began my first meal on the moon. I don't think I
finished it--I forget. Presently, first in patches, then running rapidly
together into wider spaces, came the clearing of the glass, came the
drawing of the misty veil that hid the moon world from our eyes.
We peered out upon the landscape of the moon.
Chapter 7
Sunrise on the Moon
As we saw it first it was the wildest and most desolate of scenes. We were
in an enormous amphitheatre, a vast circular plain, the floor of the giant
crater. Its cliff-like walls closed us in on every side. From the westward
the light of the unseen sun fell upon them, reaching to the very foot of
the cliff, and showed a disordered escarpment of drab and grayish rock,
lined here and there with banks and crevices of snow. This was perhaps a
dozen miles away, but at first no intervening atmosphere diminished in the
slightest the minutely detailed brilliancy with which these things glared
at us. They stood out clear and dazzling against a background of starry
blackness that seemed to our earthly eyes rather a gloriously spangled
velvet curtain than the spaciousness of the sky.
The eastward cliff was at first merely a starless selvedge to the starry
dome. No rosy flush, no creeping pallor, announced the commencing day.
Only the Corona, the Zodiacal light, a huge cone-shaped, luminous haze,
pointing up towards the splendour of the morning star, warned us of the
imminent nearness of the sun.
Whatever light was about us was reflected by the westward cliffs. It
showed a huge undulating plain, cold and gray, a gray that deepened
eastward into the absolute raven darkness of the cliff shadow. Innumerable
rounded gray summits, ghostly hummocks, billows of snowy substance,
stretching crest beyond crest into the remote obscurity, gave us our first
inkling of the distance of the crater wall. These hummocks looked like
snow. At the time I thought they were snow. But they were not--they were
mounds and masses of frozen air.
So it was at first; and then, sudden, swift, and amazing, came the lunar
day.
The sunlight had crept down the cliff, it touched the drifted masses at
its base and incontinently came striding with seven-leagued boots towards
us. The distant cliff seemed to shift and quiver, and at the touch of the
dawn a reek of gray vapour poured upward from the crater floor, whirls and
puffs and drifting wraiths of gray, thicker and broader and denser, until
at last the whole westward plain was steaming like a wet handkerchief held
before the fire, and the westward cliffs were no more than refracted glare
beyond.
"It is air," said Cavor. "It must be air--or it would not rise like
this--at the mere touch of a sun-beam. And at this pace...."
He peered upwards. "Look!" he said.
"What?" I asked.
"In the sky. Already. On the blackness--a little touch of blue. See! The
stars seem larger. And the little ones and all those dim nebulosities we
saw in empty space--they are hidden!"
Swiftly, steadily, the day approached us. Gray summit after gray summit
was overtaken by the blaze, and turned to a smoking white intensity. At
last there was nothing to the west of us but a bank of surging fog, the
tumultuous advance and ascent of cloudy haze. The distant cliff had
receded farther and farther, had loomed and changed through the whirl,
and foundered and vanished at last in its confusion.
Nearer came that steaming advance, nearer and nearer, coming as fast as
the shadow of a cloud before the south-west wind. About us rose a thin
anticipatory haze.
Cavor gripped my arm. "What?" I said.
"Look! The sunrise! The sun!"
He turned me about and pointed to the brow of the eastward cliff, looming
above the haze about us, scarce lighter than the darkness of the sky. But
now its line was marked by strange reddish shapes, tongues of vermilion
flame that writhed and danced. I fancied it must be spirals of vapour that
had caught the light and made this crest of fiery tongues against the sky,
but indeed it was the solar prominences I saw, a crown of fire about the
sun that is forever hidden from earthly eyes by our atmospheric veil.
And then--the sun!
Steadily, inevitably came a brilliant line, came a thin edge of
intolerable effulgence that took a circular shape, became a bow, became a
blazing sceptre, and hurled a shaft of heat at us as though it was a
spear.
It seemed verily to stab my eyes! I cried aloud and turned about blinded,
groping for my blanket beneath the bale.
And with that incandescence came a sound, the first sound that had reached
us from without since we left the earth, a hissing and rustling, the
stormy trailing of the aerial garment of the advancing day. And with the
coming of the sound and the light the sphere lurched, and blinded and
dazzled we staggered helplessly against each other. It lurched again, and
the hissing grew louder. I had shut my eyes perforce, I was making clumsy
efforts to cover my head with my blanket, and this second lurch sent me
helplessly off my feet. I fell against the bale, and opening my eyes had a
momentary glimpse of the air just outside our glass. It was running--it
was boiling--like snow into which a white-hot rod is thrust. What had
been solid air had suddenly at the touch of the sun become a paste, a
mud, a slushy liquefaction, that hissed and bubbled into gas.
There came a still more violent whirl of the sphere and we had clutched
one another. In another moment we were spun about again. Round we went and
over, and then I was on all fours. The lunar dawn had hold of us. It meant
to show us little men what the moon could do with us.
I caught a second glimpse of things without, puffs of vapour, half liquid
slush, excavated, sliding, falling, sliding. We dropped into darkness. I
went down with Cavor's knees in my chest. Then he seemed to fly away from
me, and for a moment I lay with all the breath out of my body staring
upward. A toppling crag of the melting stuff had splashed over us, buried
us, and now it thinned and boiled off us. I saw the bubbles dancing on the
glass above. I heard Cavor exclaiming feebly.
Then some huge landslip in the thawing air had caught us, and spluttering
expostulation, we began to roll down a slope, rolling faster and faster,
leaping crevasses and rebounding from banks, faster and faster, westward
into the white-hot boiling tumult of the lunar day.
Clutching at one another we spun about, pitched this way and that, our
bale of packages leaping at us, pounding at us. We collided, we gripped,
we were torn asunder--our heads met, and the whole universe burst into
fiery darts and stars! On the earth we should have smashed one another a
dozen times, but on the moon, luckily for us, our weight was only
one-sixth of what it is terrestrially, and we fell very mercifully. I
recall a sensation of utter sickness, a feeling as if my brain were upside
down within my skull, and then--
Something was at work upon my face, some thin feelers worried my ears.
Then I discovered the brilliance of the landscape around was mitigated by
blue spectacles. Cavor bent over me, and I saw his face upside down, his
eyes also protected by tinted goggles. His breath came irregularly, and
his lip was bleeding from a bruise. "Better?" he said, wiping the blood
with the back of his hand.
Everything seemed swaying for a space, but that was simply my giddiness. I
perceived that he had closed some of the shutters in the outer sphere to
save me--from the direct blaze of the sun. I was aware that everything
about us was very brilliant.
"Lord!" I gasped. "But this--"
I craned my neck to see. I perceived there was a blinding glare outside,
an utter change from the gloomy darkness of our first impressions. "Have I
been insensible long?" I asked.
"I don't know--the chronometer is broken. Some little time.... My dear
chap! I have been afraid..."
I lay for a space taking this in. I saw his face still bore evidences of
emotion. For a while I said nothing. I passed an inquisitive hand over my
contusions, and surveyed his face for similar damages. The back of my
right hand had suffered most, and was skinless and raw. My forehead was
bruised and had bled. He handed me a little measure with some of the
restorative--I forget the name of it--he had brought with us. After a
time I felt a little better. I began to stretch my limbs carefully. Soon
I could talk.
"It wouldn't have done," I said, as though there had been no interval.
"No! it _wouldn't_."
He thought, his hands hanging over his knees. He peered through the glass
and then stared at me.
"Good Lord!" he said. "No!"
"What has happened?" I asked after a pause. "Have we jumped to the
tropics?"
"It was as I expected. This air has evaporated--if it is air. At any
rate, it has evaporated, and the surface of the moon is showing. We are
lying on a bank of earthy rock. Here and there bare soil is exposed. A
queer sort of soil!"
It occurred to him that it was unnecessary to explain. He assisted me into
a sitting position, and I could see with my own eyes.
Chapter 8
A Lunar Morning
The harsh emphasis, the pitiless black and white of scenery had altogether
disappeared. The glare of the sun had taken upon itself a faint tinge of
amber; the shadows upon the cliff of the crater wall were deeply purple.
To the eastward a dark bank of fog still crouched and sheltered from the
sunrise, but to the westward the sky was blue and clear. I began to
realise the length of my insensibility.
We were no longer in a void. An atmosphere had arisen about us. The
outline of things had gained in character, had grown acute and varied;
save for a shadowed space of white substance here and there, white
substance that was no longer air but snow, the arctic appearance had gone
altogether. Everywhere broad rusty brown spaces of bare and tumbled earth
spread to the blaze of the sun. Here and there at the edge of the
snowdrifts were transient little pools and eddies of water, the only
things stirring in that expanse of barrenness. The sunlight inundated the
upper two blinds of our sphere and turned our climate to high summer, but
our feet were still in shadow, and the sphere was lying upon a drift of
snow.
And scattered here and there upon the slope, and emphasised by little
white threads of unthawed snow upon their shady sides, were shapes like
sticks, dry twisted sticks of the same rusty hue as the rock upon which
they lay. That caught one's thoughts sharply. Sticks! On a lifeless
world? Then as my eye grew more accustomed to the texture of their
substance, I perceived that almost all this surface had a fibrous texture,
like the carpet of brown needles one finds beneath the shade of pine
trees.
"Cavor!" I said.
"Yes."
"It may be a dead world now--but once--"
Something arrested my attention. I had discovered among these needles a
number of little round objects. And it seemed to me that one of these had
moved. "Cavor," I whispered.
"What?"
But I did not answer at once. I stared incredulous. For an instant I
could not believe my eyes. I gave an inarticulate cry. I gripped his arm.
I pointed. "Look!" I cried, finding my tongue. "There! Yes! And there!"
His eyes followed my pointing finger. "Eh?" he said.
How can I describe the thing I saw? It is so petty a thing to state, and
yet it seemed so wonderful, so pregnant with emotion. I have said that
amidst the stick-like litter were these rounded bodies, these little oval
bodies that might have passed as very small pebbles. And now first one and
then another had stirred, had rolled over and cracked, and down the crack
of each of them showed a minute line of yellowish green, thrusting outward
to meet the hot encouragement of the newly-risen sun. For a moment that
was all, and then there stirred, and burst a third!
"It is a seed," said Cavor. And then I heard him whisper very softly,
"Life!"
"Life!" And immediately it poured upon us that our vast journey had not
been made in vain, that we had come to no arid waste of minerals, but to a
world that lived and moved! We watched intensely. I remember I kept
rubbing the glass before me with my sleeve, jealous of the faintest
suspicion of mist.
The picture was clear and vivid only in the middle of the field. All about
that centre the dead fibres and seeds were magnified and distorted by the
curvature of the glass. But we could see enough! One after another all
down the sunlit slope these miraculous little brown bodies burst and gaped
apart, like seed-pods, like the husks of fruits; opened eager mouths.
that drank in the heat and light pouring in a cascade from the newly-risen
sun.
Every moment more of these seed coats ruptured, and even as they did so
the swelling pioneers overflowed their rent-distended seed-cases, and
passed into the second stage of growth. With a steady assurance, a swift
deliberation, these amazing seeds thrust a rootlet downward to the earth
and a queer little bundle-like bud into the air. In a little while the
whole slope was dotted with minute plantlets standing at attention in the
blaze of the sun.
They did not stand for long. The bundle-like buds swelled and strained and
opened with a jerk, thrusting out a coronet of little sharp tips,
spreading a whorl of tiny, spiky, brownish leaves, that lengthened
rapidly, lengthened visibly even as we watched. The movement was slower
than any animal's, swifter than any plant's I have ever seen before. How
can I suggest it to you--the way that growth went on? The leaf tips grew
so that they moved onward even while we looked at them. The brown
seed-case shrivelled and was absorbed with an equal rapidity. Have you
ever on a cold day taken a thermometer into your warm hand and watched the
little thread of mercury creep up the tube? These moon plants grew like
that.
In a few minutes, as it seemed, the buds of the more forward of these
plants had lengthened into a stem and were even putting forth a second
whorl of leaves, and all the slope that had seemed so recently a lifeless
stretch of litter was now dark with the stunted olive-green herbage of
bristling spikes that swayed with the vigour of their growing.
I turned about, and behold! along the upper edge of a rock to the eastward
a similar fringe in a scarcely less forward condition swayed and bent,
dark against the blinding glare of the sun. And beyond this fringe was the
silhouette of a plant mass, branching clumsily like a cactus, and swelling
visibly, swelling like a bladder that fills with air.
Then to the westward also I discovered that another such distended form
was rising over the scrub. But here the light fell upon its sleek sides,
and I could see that its colour was a vivid orange hue. It rose as one
watched it; if one looked away from it for a minute and then back, its
outline had changed; it thrust out blunt congested branches until in a
little time it rose a coralline shape of many feet in height. Compared
with such a growth the terrestrial puff-ball, which will sometimes swell a
foot in diameter in a single night, would be a hopeless laggard. But then
the puff-ball grows against a gravitational pull six times that of the
moon. Beyond, out of gullies and flats that had been hidden from us, but
not from the quickening sun, over reefs and banks of shining rock, a
bristling beard of spiky and fleshy vegetation was straining into view,
hurrying tumultuously to take advantage of the brief day in which it must
flower and fruit and seed again and die. It was like a miracle, that
growth. So, one must imagine, the trees and plants arose at the Creation
and covered the desolation of the new-made earth.
Imagine it! Imagine that dawn! The resurrection of the frozen air, the
stirring and quickening of the soil, and then this silent uprising of
vegetation, this unearthly ascent of fleshiness and spikes. Conceive it
all lit by a blaze that would make the intensest sunlight of earth seem
watery and weak. And still around this stirring jungle, wherever there was
shadow, lingered banks of bluish snow. And to have the picture of our
impression complete, you must bear in mind that we saw it all through a
thick bent glass, distorting it as things are distorted by a lens, acute
only in the centre of the picture, and very bright there, and towards the
edges magnified and unreal.
Chapter 9
Prospecting Begins
We ceased to gaze. We turned to each other, the same thought, the same
question in our eyes. For these plants to grow, there must be some air,
however attenuated, air that we also should be able to breathe.
"The manhole?" I said.
"Yes!" said Cavor, "if it is air we see!"
"In a little while," I said, "these plants will be as high as we are.
Suppose--suppose after all-- Is it certain? How do you know that stuff
_is_ air? It may be nitrogen--it may be carbonic acid even!"
"That's easy," he said, and set about proving it. He produced a big piece
of crumpled paper from the bale, lit it, and thrust it hastily through the
man-hole valve. I bent forward and peered down through the thick glass for
its appearance outside, that little flame on whose evidence depended so
much!
I saw the paper drop out and lie lightly upon the snow. The pink flame of
its burning vanished. For an instant it seemed to be extinguished. And
then I saw a little blue tongue upon the edge of it that trembled, and
crept, and spread!
Quietly the whole sheet, save where it lay in immediate contact with the
snow, charred and shrivelled and sent up a quivering thread of smoke.
There was no doubt left to me; the atmosphere of the moon was either pure
oxygen or air, and capable therefore--unless its tenuity was excessive--of
supporting our alien life. We might emerge--and live!
I sat down with my legs on either side of the manhole and prepared to
unscrew it, but Cavor stopped me. "There is first a little precaution,"
he said. He pointed out that although it was certainly an oxygenated
atmosphere outside, it might still be so rarefied as to cause us grave
injury. He reminded me of mountain sickness, and of the bleeding that
often afflicts aeronauts who have ascended too swiftly, and he spent some
time in the preparation of a sickly-tasting drink which he insisted on my
sharing. It made me feel a little numb, but otherwise had no effect on me.
Then he permitted me to begin unscrewing.
Presently the glass stopper of the manhole was so far undone that the
denser air within our sphere began to escape along the thread of the
screw, singing as a kettle sings before it boils. Thereupon he made me
desist. It speedily became evident that the pressure outside was very much
less than it was within. How much less it was we had no means of telling.
I sat grasping the stopper with both hands, ready to close it again if, in
spite of our intense hope, the lunar atmosphere should after all prove too
rarefied for us, and Cavor sat with a cylinder of compressed oxygen at
hand to restore our pressure. We looked at one another in silence, and
then at the fantastic vegetation that swayed and grew visibly and
noiselessly without. And ever that shrill piping continued.
My blood-vessels began to throb in my ears, and the sound of Cavor's
movements diminished. I noted how still everything had become, because of
the thinning of the air.
As our air sizzled out from the screw the moisture of it condensed in
little puffs.
Presently I experienced a peculiar shortness of breath that lasted indeed
during the whole of the time of our exposure to the moon's exterior
atmosphere, and a rather unpleasant sensation about the ears and
finger-nails and the back of the throat grew upon my attention, and
presently passed off again.
But then came vertigo and nausea that abruptly changed the quality of my
courage. I gave the lid of the manhole half a turn and made a hasty
explanation to Cavor; but now he was the more sanguine. He answered me in
a voice that seemed extraordinarily small and remote, because of the
thinness of the air that carried the sound. He recommended a nip of
brandy, and set me the example, and presently I felt better. I turned the
manhole stopper back again. The throbbing in my ears grew louder, and then
I remarked that the piping note of the outrush had ceased. For a time I
could not be sure that it had ceased.
"Well?" said Cavor, in the ghost of a voice.
"Well?" said I.
"Shall we go on?"
I thought. "Is this all?"
"If you can stand it."
By way of answer I went on unscrewing. I lifted the circular operculum
from its place and laid it carefully on the bale. A flake or so of snow
whirled and vanished as that thin and unfamiliar air took possession of
our sphere. I knelt, and then seated myself at the edge of the manhole,
peering over it. Beneath, within a yard of my face, lay the untrodden snow
of the moon.
There came a little pause. Our eyes met.
"It doesn't distress your lungs too much?" said Cavor.
"No," I said. "I can stand this."
He stretched out his hand for his blanket, thrust his head through its
central hole, and wrapped it about him. He sat down on the edge of the
manhole, he let his feet drop until they were within six inches of the
lunar ground. He hesitated for a moment, then thrust himself forward,
dropped these intervening inches, and stood upon the untrodden soil of the
moon.
As he stepped forward he was refracted grotesquely by the edge of the
glass. He stood for a moment looking this way and that. Then he drew
himself together and leapt.
The glass distorted everything, but it seemed to me even then to be an
extremely big leap. He had at one bound become remote. He seemed twenty or
thirty feet off. He was standing high upon a rocky mass and gesticulating
back to me. Perhaps he was shouting--but the sound did not reach me. But
how the deuce had he done this? I felt like a man who has just seen a new
conjuring trick.
In a puzzled state of mind I too dropped through the manhole. I stood up.
Just in front of me the snowdrift had fallen away and made a sort of
ditch. I made a step and jumped.
I found myself flying through the air, saw the rock on which he stood
coming to meet me, clutched it and clung in a state of infinite amazement.
I gasped a painful laugh. I was tremendously confused. Cavor bent down
and shouted in piping tones for me to be careful.
I had forgotten that on the moon, with only an eighth part of the earth's
mass and a quarter of its diameter, my weight was barely a sixth what it
was on earth. But now that fact insisted on being remembered.
"We are out of Mother Earth's leading-strings now," he said.
With a guarded effort I raised myself to the top, and moving as cautiously
as a rheumatic patient, stood up beside him under the blaze of the sun.
The sphere lay behind us on its dwindling snowdrift thirty feet away.
As far as the eye could see over the enormous disorder of rocks that
formed the crater floor, the same bristling scrub that surrounded us was
starting into life, diversified here and there by bulging masses of a
cactus form, and scarlet and purple lichens that grew so fast they seemed
to crawl over the rocks. The whole area of the crater seemed to me then to
be one similar wilderness up to the very foot of the surrounding cliff.
This cliff was apparently bare of vegetation save at its base, and with
buttresses and terraces and platforms that did not very greatly attract
our attention at the time. It was many miles away from us in every
direction; we seemed to be almost at the centre of the crater, and we saw
it through a certain haziness that drove before the wind. For there was
even a wind now in the thin air, a swift yet weak wind that chilled
exceedingly but exerted little pressure. It was blowing round the
crater, as it seemed, to the hot illuminated side from the foggy darkness
under the sunward wall. It was difficult to look into this eastward fog;
we had to peer with half-closed eyes beneath the shade of our hands,
because of the fierce intensity of the motionless sun.
"It seems to be deserted," said Cavor, "absolutely desolate."
I looked about me again. I retained even then a clinging hope of some
quasi-human evidence, some pinnacle of building, some house or engine, but
everywhere one looked spread the tumbled rocks in peaks and crests, and
the darting scrub and those bulging cacti that swelled and swelled, a flat
negation as it seemed of all such hope.
"It looks as though these plants had it to themselves," I said. "I see no
trace of any other creature."
"No insects--no birds, no! Not a trace, not a scrap nor particle of
animal life. If there was--what would they do in the night? ... No;
there's just these plants alone."
I shaded my eyes with my hand. "It's like the landscape of a dream. These
things are less like earthly land plants than the things one imagines
among the rocks at the bottom of the sea. Look at that yonder! One might
imagine it a lizard changed into a plant. And the glare!"
"This is only the fresh morning," said Cavor.
He sighed and looked about him. "This is no world for men," he said. "And
yet in a way--it appeals."
He became silent for a time, then commenced his meditative humming.
I started at a gentle touch, and found a thin sheet of livid lichen
lapping over my shoe. I kicked at it and it fell to powder, and each speck
began to grow.
I heard Cavor exclaim sharply, and perceived that one of the fixed
bayonets of the scrub had pricked him. He hesitated, his eyes sought
among the rocks about us. A sudden blaze of pink had crept up a ragged
pillar of crag. It was a most extraordinary pink, a livid magenta.
"Look!" said I, turning, and behold Cavor had vanished.
For an instant I stood transfixed. Then I made a hasty step to look over
the verge of the rock. But in my surprise at his disappearance I forgot
once more that we were on the moon. The thrust of my foot that I made in
striding would have carried me a yard on earth; on the moon it carried me
six--a good five yards over the edge. For the moment the thing had
something of the effect of those nightmares when one falls and falls. For
while one falls sixteen feet in the first second of a fall on earth, on
the moon one falls two, and with only a sixth of one's weight. I fell, or
rather I jumped down, about ten yards I suppose. It seemed to take quite a
long time, five or six seconds, I should think. I floated through the air
and fell like a feather, knee-deep in a snow-drift in the bottom of a
gully of blue-gray, white-veined rock.
I looked about me. "Cavor!" I cried; but no Cavor was visible.
"Cavor!" I cried louder, and the rocks echoed me.
I turned fiercely to the rocks and clambered to the summit of them.
"Cavor!" I cried. My voice sounded like the voice of a lost lamb.
The sphere, too, was not in sight, and for a moment a horrible feeling of
desolation pinched my heart.
Then I saw him. He was laughing and gesticulating to attract my attention.
He was on a bare patch of rock twenty or thirty yards away. I could not
hear his voice, but "jump" said his gestures. I hesitated, the distance
seemed enormous. Yet I reflected that surely I must be able to clear a
greater distance than Cavor.
I made a step back, gathered myself together, and leapt with all my might.
I seemed to shoot right up in the air as though I should never come down.
It was horrible and delightful, and as wild as a nightmare, to go flying
off in this fashion. I realised my leap had been altogether too violent.
I flew clean over Cavor's head and beheld a spiky confusion in a gully
spreading to meet my fall. I gave a yelp of alarm. I put out my hands and
straightened my legs.
I hit a huge fungoid bulk that burst all about me, scattering a mass of
orange spores in every direction, and covering me with orange powder. I
rolled over spluttering, and came to rest convulsed with breathless
laughter.
I became aware of Cavor's little round face peering over a bristling
hedge. He shouted some faded inquiry. "Eh?" I tried to shout, but could
not do so for want of breath. He made his way towards me, coming gingerly
among the bushes.
"We've got to be careful," he said. "This moon has no discipline. She'll
let us smash ourselves."
He helped me to my feet. "You exerted yourself too much," he said, dabbing
at the yellow stuff with his hand to remove it from my garments.
I stood passive and panting, allowing him to beat off the jelly from my
knees and elbows and lecture me upon my misfortunes. "We don't quite
allow for the gravitation. Our muscles are scarcely educated yet. We must
practise a little, when you have got your breath."
I pulled two or three little thorns out of my hand, and sat for a time on
a boulder of rock. My muscles were quivering, and I had that feeling of
personal disillusionment that comes at the first fall to the learner of
cycling on earth.
It suddenly occurred to Cavor that the cold air in the gully, after the
brightness of the sun, might give me a fever. So we clambered back into
the sunlight. We found that beyond a few abrasions I had received no
serious injuries from my tumble, and at Cavor's suggestion we were
presently looking round for some safe and easy landing-place for my next
leap. We chose a rocky slab some ten yards off, separated from us by a
little thicket of olive-green spikes.
"Imagine it there!" said Cavor, who was assuming the airs of a trainer,
and he pointed to a spot about four feet from my toes. This leap I managed
without difficulty, and I must confess I found a certain satisfaction in
Cavor's falling short by a foot or so and tasting the spikes of the scrub.
"One has to be careful you see," he said, pulling out his thorns, and with
that he ceased to be my mentor and became my fellow-learner in the art of
lunar locomotion.
We chose a still easier jump and did it without difficulty, and then leapt
back again, and to and fro several times, accustoming our muscles to the
new standard. I could never have believed had I not experienced it, how
rapid that adaptation would be. In a very little time indeed, certainly
after fewer than thirty leaps, we could judge the effort necessary for a
distance with almost terrestrial assurance.
And all this time the lunar plants were growing around us, higher and
denser and more entangled, every moment thicker and taller, spiked plants,
green cactus masses, fungi, fleshy and lichenous things, strangest radiate
and sinuous shapes. But we were so intent upon our leaping, that for a
time we gave no heed to their unfaltering expansion.
An extraordinary elation had taken possession of us. Partly, I think, it
was our sense of release from the confinement of the sphere. Mainly,
however, the thin sweetness of the air, which I am certain contained a
much larger proportion of oxygen than our terrestrial atmosphere. In spite
of the strange quality of all about us, I felt as adventurous and
experimental as a cockney would do placed for the first time among
mountains and I do not think it occurred to either of us, face to face
though we were with the unknown, to be very greatly afraid.
We were bitten by a spirit of enterprise. We selected a lichenous kopje
perhaps fifteen yards away, and landed neatly on its summit one after the
other. "Good!" we cried to each other; "good!" and Cavor made three steps
and went off to a tempting slope of snow a good twenty yards and more
beyond. I stood for a moment struck by the grotesque effect of his
soaring figure--his dirty cricket cap, and spiky hair, his little round
body, his arms and his knicker-bockered legs tucked up tightly--against
the weird spaciousness of the lunar scene. A gust of laughter seized me,
and then I stepped off to follow. Plump! I dropped beside him.
We made a few gargantuan strides, leapt three or four times more, and sat
down at last in a lichenous hollow. Our lungs were painful. We sat holding
our sides and recovering our breath, looking appreciation to one another.
Cavor panted something about "amazing sensations." And then came a thought
into my head. For the moment it did not seem a particularly appalling
thought, simply a natural question arising out of the situation.
"By the way," I said, "where exactly is the sphere?"
Cavor looked at me. "Eh?"
The full meaning of what we were saying struck me sharply.
"Cavor!" I cried, laying a hand on his arm, "where is the sphere?"
Chapter 10
Lost Men in the Moon
His face caught something of my dismay. He stood up and stared about him
at the scrub that fenced us in and rose about us, straining upward in a
passion of growth. He put a dubious hand to his lips. He spoke with a
sudden lack of assurance. "I think," he said slowly, "we left it ...
somewhere ... about _there_."
He pointed a hesitating finger that wavered in an arc.
"I'm not sure." His look of consternation deepened. "Anyhow," he said,
with his eyes on me, "it can't be far."
We had both stood up. We made unmeaning ejaculations, our eyes sought in
the twining, thickening jungle round about us.
All about us on the sunlit slopes frothed and swayed the darting shrubs,
the swelling cactus, the creeping lichens, and wherever the shade remained
the snow-drifts lingered. North, south, east, and west spread an identical
monotony of unfamiliar forms. And somewhere, buried already among this
tangled confusion, was our sphere, our home, our only provision, our only
hope of escape from this fantastic wilderness of ephemeral growths into
which we had come.
"I think after all," he said, pointing suddenly, "it might be over there."
"No," I said. "We have turned in a curve. See! here is the mark of my
heels. It's clear the thing must be more to the eastward, much more.
No--the sphere must be over there."
"I _think_," said Cavor, "I kept the sun upon my right all the time."
"Every leap, it seems to me," I said, "my shadow flew before me."
We stared into one another's eyes. The area of the crater had become
enormously vast to our imaginations, the growing thickets already
impenetrably dense.
"Good heavens! What fools we have been!"
"It's evident that we must find it again," said Cavor, "and that soon.
The sun grows stronger. We should be fainting with the heat already if
it wasn't so dry. And ... I'm hungry."
I stared at him. I had not suspected this aspect of the matter before. But
it came to me at once--a positive craving. "Yes," I said with emphasis.
"I am hungry too."
He stood up with a look of active resolution. "Certainly we must find the
sphere."
As calmly as possible we surveyed the interminable reefs and thickets that
formed the floor of the crater, each of us weighing in silence the chances
of our finding the sphere before we were overtaken by heat and hunger.
"It can't be fifty yards from here," said Cavor, with indecisive gestures.
"The only thing is to beat round about until we come upon it."
"That is all we can do," I said, without any alacrity to begin our hunt.
"I wish this confounded spike bush did not grow so fast!"
"That's just it," said Cavor. "But it was lying on a bank of snow."
I stared about me in the vain hope of recognising some knoll or shrub that
had been near the sphere. But everywhere was a confusing sameness,
everywhere the aspiring bushes, the distending fungi, the dwindling snow
banks, steadily and inevitably changed. The sun scorched and stung, the
faintness of an unaccountable hunger mingled with our infinite perplexity.
And even as we stood there, confused and lost amidst unprecedented things,
we became aware for the first time of a sound upon the moon other than the
air of the growing plants, the faint sighing of the wind, or those that we
ourselves had made.
Boom.... Boom.... Boom.
It came from beneath our feet, a sound in the earth. We seemed to hear it
with our feet as much as with our ears. Its dull resonance was muffled by
distance, thick with the quality of intervening substance. No sound that I
can imagine could have astonished us more, or have changed more completely
the quality of things about us. For this sound, rich, slow, and
deliberate, seemed to us as though it could be nothing but the striking of
some gigantic buried clock.
Boom.... Boom.... Boom.
Sound suggestive of still cloisters, of sleepless nights in crowded
cities, of vigils and the awaited hour, of all that is orderly and
methodical in life, booming out pregnant and mysterious in this fantastic
desert! To the eye everything was unchanged: the desolation of bushes and
cacti waving silently in the wind, stretched unbroken to the distant
cliffs, the still dark sky was empty overhead, and the hot sun hung and
burned. And through it all, a warning, a threat, throbbed this enigma of
sound.
Boom.... Boom.... Boom....
We questioned one another in faint and faded voices.
"A clock?"
"Like a clock!"
"What is it?"
"What can it be?"
"Count," was Cavor's belated suggestion, and at that word the striking
ceased.
The silence, the rhythmic disappointment of the silence, came as a fresh
shock. For a moment one could doubt whether one had ever heard a sound. Or
whether it might not still be going on. Had I indeed heard a sound?
I felt the pressure of Cavor's hand upon my arm. He spoke in an
undertone, as though he feared to wake some sleeping thing. "Let us keep
together," he whispered, "and look for the sphere. We must get back to the
sphere. This is beyond our understanding."
"Which way shall we go?"
He hesitated. An intense persuasion of presences, of unseen things about
us and near us, dominated our minds. What could they be? Where could they
be? Was this arid desolation, alternately frozen and scorched, only the
outer rind and mask of some subterranean world? And if so, what sort of
world? What sort of inhabitants might it not presently disgorge upon us?
And then, stabbing the aching stillness as vivid and sudden as an
unexpected thunderclap, came a clang and rattle as though great gates of
metal had suddenly been flung apart.
It arrested our steps. We stood gaping helplessly. Then Cavor stole
towards me.
"I do not understand!" he whispered close to my face. He waved his hand
vaguely skyward, the vague suggestion of still vaguer thoughts.
"A hiding-place! If anything came..."
I looked about us. I nodded my head in assent to him.
We started off, moving stealthily with the most exaggerated precautions
against noise. We went towards a thicket of scrub. A clangour like hammers
flung about a boiler hastened our steps. "We must crawl," whispered Cavor.
The lower leaves of the bayonet plants, already overshadowed by the newer
ones above, were beginning to wilt and shrivel so that we could thrust our
way in among the thickening stems without serious injury. A stab in the
face or arm we did not heed. At the heart of the thicket I stopped, and
stared panting into Cavor's face.
"Subterranean," he whispered. "Below."
"They may come out."
"We must find the sphere!"
"Yes," I said; "but how?"
"Crawl till we come to it."
"But if we don't?"
"Keep hidden. See what they are like."
"We will keep together," said I.
He thought. "Which way shall we go?"
"We must take our chance."
We peered this way and that. Then very circumspectly, we began to crawl
through the lower jungle, making, so far as we could judge, a circuit,
halting now at every waving fungus, at every sound, intent only on the
sphere from which we had so foolishly emerged. Ever and again from out of
the earth beneath us came concussions, beatings, strange, inexplicable,
mechanical sounds; and once, and then again, we thought we heard
something, a faint rattle and tumult, borne to us through the air. But
fearful as we were we dared essay no vantage-point to survey the crater.
For long we saw nothing of the beings whose sounds were so abundant and
insistent. But for the faintness of our hunger and the drying of our
throats that crawling would have had the quality of a very vivid dream. It
was so absolutely unreal. The only element with any touch of reality was
these sounds.
Picture it to yourself! About us the dream-like jungle, with the silent
bayonet leaves darting overhead, and the silent, vivid, sun-splashed
lichens under our hands and knees, waving with the vigour of their growth
as a carpet waves when the wind gets beneath it. Ever and again one of the
bladder fungi, bulging and distending under the sun, loomed upon us. Ever
and again some novel shape in vivid colour obtruded. The very cells that
built up these plants were as large as my thumb, like beads of coloured
glass. And all these things were saturated in the unmitigated glare of the
sun, were seen against a sky that was bluish black and spangled still, in
spite of the sunlight, with a few surviving stars. Strange! the very forms
and texture of the stones were strange. It was all strange, the feeling of
one's body was unprecedented, every other movement ended in a surprise.
The breath sucked thin in one's throat, the blood flowed through one's
ears in a throbbing tide--thud, thud, thud, thud....
And ever and again came gusts of turmoil, hammering, the clanging and
throb of machinery, and presently--the bellowing of great beasts!
Chapter 11
The Mooncalf Pastures
So we two poor terrestrial castaways, lost in that wild-growing moon
jungle, crawled in terror before the sounds that had come upon us. We
crawled, as it seemed, a long time before we saw either Selenite or
mooncalf, though we heard the bellowing and gruntulous noises of these
latter continually drawing nearer to us. We crawled through stony ravines,
over snow slopes, amidst fungi that ripped like thin bladders at our
thrust, emitting a watery humour, over a perfect pavement of things like
puff-balls, and beneath interminable thickets of scrub. And ever more
helplessly our eyes sought for our abandoned sphere. The noise of the
mooncalves would at times be a vast flat calf-like sound, at times it rose
to an amazed and wrathy bellowing, and again it would become a clogged
bestial sound, as though these unseen creatures had sought to eat and
bellow at the same time.
Our first view was but an inadequate transitory glimpse, yet none the less
disturbing because it was incomplete. Cavor was crawling in front at the
time, and he first was aware of their proximity. He stopped dead,
arresting me with a single gesture.
A crackling and smashing of the scrub appeared to be advancing directly
upon us, and then, as we squatted close and endeavoured to judge of the
nearness and direction of this noise, there came a terrific bellow behind
us, so close and vehement that the tops of the bayonet scrub bent before
it, and one felt the breath of it hot and moist. And, turning about, we
saw indistinctly through a crowd of swaying stems the mooncalf's shining
sides, and the long line of its back loomed out against the sky.
Of course it is hard for me now to say how much I saw at that time,
because my impressions were corrected by subsequent observation. First of
all impressions was its enormous size; the girth of its body was some
fourscore feet, its length perhaps two hundred. Its sides rose and fell
with its laboured breathing. I perceived that its gigantic, flabby body
lay along the ground, and that its skin was of a corrugated white,
dappling into blackness along the backbone. But of its feet we saw
nothing. I think also that we saw then the profile at least of the almost
brainless head, with its fat-encumbered neck, its slobbering omnivorous
mouth, its little nostrils, and tight shut eyes. (For the mooncalf
invariably shuts its eyes in the presence of the sun.) We had a glimpse of
a vast red pit as it opened its mouth to bleat and bellow again; we had a
breath from the pit, and then the monster heeled over like a ship, dragged
forward along the ground, creasing all its leathery skin, rolled again,
and so wallowed past us, smashing a path amidst the scrub, and was
speedily hidden from our eyes by the dense interlacings beyond. Another
appeared more distantly, and then another, and then, as though he was
guiding these animated lumps of provender to their pasture, a Selenite
came momentarily into ken. My grip upon Cavor's foot became convulsive at
the sight of him, and we remained motionless and peering long after he had
passed out of our range.
By contrast with the mooncalves he seemed a trivial being, a mere ant,
scarcely five feet high. He was wearing garments of some leathery
substance, so that no portion of his actual body appeared, but of this, of
course, we were entirely ignorant. He presented himself, therefore, as a
compact, bristling creature, having much of the quality of a complicated
insect, with whip-like tentacles and a clanging arm projecting from his
shining cylindrical body case. The form of his head was hidden by his
enormous many-spiked helmet--we discovered afterwards that he used the
spikes for prodding refractory mooncalves--and a pair of goggles of
darkened glass, set very much at the side, gave a bird-like quality to the
metallic apparatus that covered his face. His arms did not project beyond
his body case, and he carried himself upon short legs that, wrapped though
they were in warm coverings, seemed to our terrestrial eyes inordinately
flimsy. They had very short thighs, very long shanks, and little feet.
In spite of his heavy-looking clothing, he was progressing with what would
be, from the terrestrial point of view, very considerable strides, and his
clanging arm was busy. The quality of his motion during the instant of his
passing suggested haste and a certain anger, and soon after we had lost
sight of him we heard the bellow of a mooncalf change abruptly into a
short, sharp squeal followed by the scuffle of its acceleration. And
gradually that bellowing receded, and then came to an end, as if the
pastures sought had been attained.
We listened. For a space the moon world was still. But it was some time
before we resumed our crawling search for the vanished sphere.
When next we saw mooncalves they were some little distance away from us in
a place of tumbled rocks. The less vertical surfaces of the rocks were
thick with a speckled green plant growing in dense mossy clumps, upon
which these creatures were browsing. We stopped at the edge of the reeds
amidst which we were crawling at the sight of them, peering out at then
and looking round for a second glimpse of a Selenite. They lay against
their food like stupendous slugs, huge, greasy hulls, eating greedily and
noisily, with a sort of sobbing avidity. They seemed monsters of mere
fatness, clumsy and overwhelmed to a degree that would make a Smithfield
ox seem a model of agility. Their busy, writhing, chewing mouths, and eyes
closed, together with the appetising sound of their munching, made up an
effect of animal enjoyment that was singularly stimulating to our empty
frames.
"Hogs!" said Cavor, with unusual passion. "Disgusting hogs!" and after
one glare of angry envy crawled off through the bushes to our right. I
stayed long enough to see that the speckled plant was quite hopeless for
human nourishment, then crawled after him, nibbling a quill of it between
my teeth.
Presently we were arrested again by the proximity of a Selenite, and this
time we were able to observe him more exactly. Now we could see that the
Selenite covering was indeed clothing, and not a sort of crustacean
integument. He was quite similar in his costume to the former one we had
glimpsed, except that ends of something like wadding were protruding from
his neck, and he stood on a promontory of rock and moved his head this way
and that, as though he was surveying the crater. We lay quite still,
fearing to attract his attention if we moved, and after a time he turned
about and disappeared.
We came upon another drove of mooncalves bellowing up a ravine, and then
we passed over a place of sounds, sounds of beating machinery as if some
huge hall of industry came near the surface there. And while these sounds
were still about us we came to the edge of a great open space, perhaps two
hundred yards in diameter, and perfectly level. Save for a few lichens
that advanced from its margin this space was bare, and presented a powdery
surface of a dusty yellow colour. We were afraid to strike out across
this space, but as it presented less obstruction to our crawling than the
scrub, we went down upon it and began very circumspectly to skirt its
edge.
For a little while the noises from below ceased and everything, save for
the faint stir of the growing vegetation, was very still. Then abruptly
there began an uproar, louder, more vehement, and nearer than any we had
so far heard. Of a certainty it came from below. Instinctively we crouched
as flat as we could, ready for a prompt plunge into the thicket beside us.
Each knock and throb seemed to vibrate through our bodies. Louder grew
this throbbing and beating, and that irregular vibration increased until
the whole moon world seemed to be jerking and pulsing.
"Cover," whispered Cavor, and I turned towards the bushes.
At that instant came a thud like the thud of a gun, and then a thing
happened--it still haunts me in my dreams. I had turned my head to look
at Cavor's face, and thrust out my hand in front of me as I did so.
And my hand met nothing! I plunged suddenly into a bottomless hole!
My chest hit something hard, and I found myself with my chin on the edge
of an unfathomable abyss that had suddenly opened beneath me, my hand
extended stiffly into the void. The whole of that flat circular area was
no more than a gigantic lid, that was now sliding sideways from off the
pit it had covered into a slot prepared for it.
Had it not been for Cavor I think I should have remained rigid, hanging
over this margin and staring into the enormous gulf below, until at last
the edges of the slot scraped me off and hurled me into its depths. But
Cavor had not received the shock that had paralysed me. He had been a
little distance from the edge when the lid had first opened, and
perceiving the peril that held me helpless, gripped my legs and pulled me
backward. I came into a sitting position, crawled away from the edge for a
space on all fours, then staggered up and ran after him across the
thundering, quivering sheet of metal. It seemed to be swinging open with a
steadily accelerated velocity, and the bushes in front of me shifted
sideways as I ran.
I was none too soon. Cavor's back vanished amidst the bristling thicket,
and as I scrambled up after him, the monstrous valve came into its
position with a clang. For a long time we lay panting, not daring to
approach the pit.
But at last very cautiously and bit by bit we crept into a position from
which we could peer down. The bushes about us creaked and waved with the
force of a breeze that was blowing down the shaft. We could see nothing at
first except smooth vertical walls descending at last into an impenetrable
black. And then very gradually we became aware of a number of very faint
and little lights going to and fro.
For a time that stupendous gulf of mystery held us so that we forgot even
our sphere. In time, as we grew more accustomed to the darkness, we could
make out very small, dim, elusive shapes moving about among those
needle-point illuminations. We peered amazed and incredulous,
understanding so little that we could find no words to say. We could
distinguish nothing that would give us a clue to the meaning of the faint
shapes we saw.
"What can it be?" I asked; "what can it be?"
"The engineering!... They must live in these caverns during the night, and
come out during the day."
"Cavor!" I said. "Can they be--that--it was something like--men?"
"_That_ was not a man."
"We dare risk nothing!"
"We dare do nothing until we find the sphere!"
"We _can_ do nothing until we find the sphere."
He assented with a groan and stirred himself to move. He stared about him
for a space, sighed, and indicated a direction. We struck out through the
jungle. For a time we crawled resolutely, then with diminishing vigour.
Presently among great shapes of flabby purple there came a noise of
trampling and cries about us. We lay close, and for a long time the sounds
went to and fro and very near. But this time we saw nothing. I tried to
whisper to Cavor that I could hardly go without food much longer, but my
mouth had become too dry for whispering.
"Cavor," I said, "I must have food."
He turned a face full of dismay towards me. "It's a case for holding out,"
he said.
"But I _must_," I said, "and look at my lips!"
"I've been thirsty some time."
"If only some of that snow had remained!"
"It's clean gone! We're driving from arctic to tropical at the rate of a
degree a minute...."
I gnawed my hand.
"The sphere!" he said. "There is nothing for it but the sphere."
We roused ourselves to another spurt of crawling. My mind ran entirely on
edible things, on the hissing profundity of summer drinks, more
particularly I craved for beer. I was haunted by the memory of a sixteen
gallon cask that had swaggered in my Lympne cellar. I thought of the
adjacent larder, and especially of steak and kidney pie--tender steak and
plenty of kidney, and rich, thick gravy between. Ever and again I was
seized with fits of hungry yawning. We came to flat places overgrown with
fleshy red things, monstrous coralline growths; as we pushed against them
they snapped and broke. I noted the quality of the broken surfaces. The
confounded stuff certainly looked of a biteable texture. Then it seemed to
me that it smelt rather well.
I picked up a fragment and sniffed at it.
"Cavor," I said in a hoarse undertone.
He glanced at me with his face screwed up. "Don't," he said. I put down
the fragment, and we crawled on through this tempting fleshiness for
a space.
"Cavor," I asked, "why not?"
"Poison," I heard him say, but he did not look round.
We crawled some way before I decided.
"I'll chance it," said I.
He made a belated gesture to prevent me. I stuffed my mouth full. He
crouched watching my face, his own twisted into the oddest expression.
"It's good," I said.
"O Lord!" he cried.
He watched me munch, his face wrinkled between desire and disapproval,
then suddenly succumbed to appetite and began to tear off huge mouthfuls.
For a time we did nothing but eat.
The stuff was not unlike a terrestrial mushroom, only it was much laxer in
texture, and, as one swallowed it, it warmed the throat. At first we
experienced a mere mechanical satisfaction in eating; then our blood began
to run warmer, and we tingled at the lips and fingers, and then new and
slightly irrelevant ideas came bubbling up in our minds.
"Its good," said I. "Infernally good! What a home for our surplus
population! Our poor surplus population," and I broke off another large
portion. It filled me with a curiously benevolent satisfaction that there
was such good food in the moon. The depression of my hunger gave way to an
irrational exhilaration. The dread and discomfort in which I had been
living vanished entirely. I perceived the moon no longer as a planet from
which I most earnestly desired the means of escape, but as a possible
refuge from human destitution. I think I forgot the Selenites, the
mooncalves, the lid, and the noises completely so soon as I had eaten that
fungus.
Cavor replied to my third repetition of my "surplus population" remark
with similar words of approval. I felt that my head swam, but I put this
down to the stimulating effect of food after a long fast. "Ess'lent
discov'ry yours, Cavor," said I. "Se'nd on'y to the 'tato."
"Whajer mean?" asked Cavor. "'Scovery of the moon--se'nd on'y to the
'tato?"
I looked at him, shocked at his suddenly hoarse voice, and by the badness
of his articulation. It occurred to me in a flash that he was intoxicated,
possibly by the fungus. It also occurred to me that he erred in imagining
that he had discovered the moon; he had not discovered it, he had only
reached it. I tried to lay my hand on his arm and explain this to him, but
the issue was too subtle for his brain. It was also unexpectedly difficult
to express. After a momentary attempt to understand me--I remember
wondering if the fungus had made my eyes as fishy as his--he set off upon
some observations on his own account.
"We are," he announced with a solemn hiccup, "the creashurs o' what we
eat and drink."
He repeated this, and as I was now in one of my subtle moods, I determined
to dispute it. Possibly I wandered a little from the point. But Cavor
certainly did not attend at all properly. He stood up as well as he could,
putting a hand on my head to steady himself, which was disrespectful,
and stood staring about him, quite devoid now of any fear of the moon
beings.
I tried to point out that this was dangerous for some reason that was not
perfectly clear to me, but the word "dangerous" had somehow got mixed with
"indiscreet," and came out rather more like "injurious" than either; and
after an attempt to disentangle them, I resumed my argument, addressing
myself principally to the unfamiliar but attentive coralline growths on
either side. I felt that it was necessary to clear up this confusion
between the moon and a potato at once--I wandered into a long parenthesis
on the importance of precision of definition in argument. I did my best to
ignore the fact that my bodily sensations were no longer agreeable.
In some way that I have now forgotten, my mind was led back to projects
of colonisation. "We must annex this moon," I said. "There must be
no shilly-shally. This is part of the White Man's Burthen. Cavor--we
are--hic--Satap--mean Satraps! Nempire Caesar never dreamt. B'in all
the newspapers. Cavorecia. Bedfordecia. Bedfordecia--hic--Limited.
Mean--unlimited! Practically."
Certainly I was intoxicated.
I embarked upon an argument to show the infinite benefits our arrival
would confer on the moon. I involved myself in a rather difficult proof
that the arrival of Columbus was, on the whole, beneficial to America. I
found I had forgotten the line of argument I had intended to pursue, and
continued to repeat "sim'lar to C'lumbus," to fill up time.
From that point my memory of the action of that abominable fungus becomes
confused. I remember vaguely that we declared our intention of standing no
nonsense from any confounded insects, that we decided it ill became men to
hide shamefully upon a mere satellite, that we equipped ourselves with
huge armfuls of the fungus--whether for missile purposes or not I do not
know--and, heedless of the stabs of the bayonet scrub, we started forth
into the sunshine.
Almost immediately we must have come upon the Selenites. There were six of
them, and they were marching in single file over a rocky place, making the
most remarkable piping and whining sounds. They all seemed to become aware
of us at once, all instantly became silent and motionless, like animals,
with their faces turned towards us.
For a moment I was sobered.
"Insects," murmured Cavor, "insects! And they think I'm going to crawl
about on my stomach--on my vertebrated stomach!
"Stomach," he repeated slowly, as though he chewed the indignity.
Then suddenly, with a sort of fury, he made three vast strides and leapt
towards them. He leapt badly; he made a series of somersaults in the air,
whirled right over them, and vanished with an enormous splash amidst the
cactus bladders. What the Selenites made of this amazing, and to my mind
undignified irruption from another planet, I have no means of guessing. I
seem to remember the sight of their backs as they ran in all directions,
but I am not sure. All these last incidents before oblivion came are vague
and faint in my mind. I know I made a step to follow Cavor, and tripped
and fell headlong among the rocks. I was, I am certain, suddenly and
vehemently ill. I seem to remember, a violent struggle and being gripped
by metallic clasps....
My next clear recollection is that we were prisoners at we knew not what
depths beneath the moon's surface; we were in darkness amidst strange
distracting noises; our bodies were covered with scratches and bruises,
and our heads racked with pain.
Chapter 12
The Selenite's Face
I found myself sitting crouched together in a tumultuous darkness. For a
long time I could not understand where I was, nor how I had come to this
perplexity. I thought of the cupboard into which I had been thrust at
times when I was a child, and then of a very dark and noisy bedroom in
which I had slept during an illness. But these sounds about me were not
the noises I had known, and there was a thin flavour in the air like the
wind of a stable. Then I supposed we must still be at work upon the
sphere, and that somehow I had got into the cellar of Cavor's house. I
remembered we had finished the sphere, and fancied I must still be in it
and travelling through space.
"Cavor," I said, "cannot we have some light?"
There came no answer.
"Cavor!" I insisted.
I was answered by a groan. "My head!" I heard him say; "my head!"
I attempted to press my hands to my brow, which ached, and discovered they
were tied together. This startled me very much. I brought them up to my
mouth and felt the cold smoothness of metal. They were chained together. I
tried to separate my legs and made out they were similarly fastened, and
also that I was fastened to the ground by a much thicker chain about the
middle of my body.
I was more frightened than I had yet been by anything in all our strange
experiences. For a time I tugged silently at my bonds. "Cavor!" I cried
out sharply. "Why am I tied? Why have you tied me hand and foot?"
"I haven't tied you," he answered. "It's the Selenites."
The Selenites! My mind hung on that for a space. Then my memories came
back to me: the snowy desolation, the thawing of the air, the growth of
the plants, our strange hopping and crawling among the rocks and
vegetation of the crater. All the distress of our frantic search for the
sphere returned to me.... Finally the opening of the great lid that
covered the pit!
Then as I strained to trace our later movements down to our present
plight, the pain in my head became intolerable. I came to an
insurmountable barrier, an obstinate blank.
"Cavor!"
"Yes?"
"Where are we?"
"How should I know?"
"Are we dead?"
"What nonsense!"
"They've got us, then!"
He made no answer but a grunt. The lingering traces of the poison seemed
to make him oddly irritable.
"What do you mean to do?"
"How should I know what to do?"
"Oh, very well!" said I, and became silent. Presently, I was roused from
a stupor. "O Lord!" I cried; "I wish you'd stop that buzzing!"
We lapsed into silence again, listening to the dull confusion of noises
like the muffled sounds of a street or factory that filled our ears. I
could make nothing of it, my mind pursued first one rhythm and then
another, and questioned it in vain. But after a long time I became aware
of a new and sharper element, not mingling with the rest but standing out,
as it were, against that cloudy background of sound. It was a series of
relatively very little definite sounds, tappings and rubbings, like a
loose spray of ivy against a window or a bird moving about upon a box. We
listened and peered about us, but the darkness was a velvet pall. There
followed a noise like the subtle movement of the wards of a well-oiled
lock. And then there appeared before me, hanging as it seemed in an
immensity of black, a thin bright line.
"Look!" whispered Cavor very softly.
"What is it?"
"I don't know."
We stared.
The thin bright line became a band, and broader and paler. It took upon
itself the quality of a bluish light falling upon a white-washed wall. It
ceased to be parallel-sided; it developed a deep indentation on one side.
I turned to remark this to Cavor, and was amazed to see his ear in a
brilliant illumination--all the rest of him in shadow. I twisted my head
round as well as my bonds would permit. "Cavor," I said, "it's behind!"
His ear vanished--gave place to an eye!
Suddenly the crack that had been admitting the light broadened out, and
revealed itself as the space of an opening door. Beyond was a sapphire
vista, and in the doorway stood a grotesque outline silhouetted against
the glare.
We both made convulsive efforts to turn, and failing, sat staring over our
shoulders at this. My first impression was of some clumsy quadruped with
lowered head. Then I perceived it was the slender pinched body and short
and extremely attenuated bandy legs of a Selenite, with his head depressed
between his shoulders. He was without the helmet and body covering they
wear upon the exterior.
He was a blank, black figure to us, but instinctively our imaginations
supplied features to his very human outline. I, at least, took it
instantly that he was somewhat hunchbacked, with a high forehead and long
features.
He came forward three steps and paused for a time. His movements seemed
absolutely noiseless. Then he came forward again. He walked like a bird,
his feet fell one in front of the other. He stepped out of the ray of
light that came through the doorway, and it seemed as though he vanished
altogether in the shadow.
For a moment my eyes sought him in the wrong place, and then I perceived
him standing facing us both in the full light. Only the human features I
had attributed to him were not there at all!
Of course I ought to have expected that, only I didn't. It came to me as
an absolute, for a moment an overwhelming shock. It seemed as though it
wasn't a face, as though it must needs be a mask, a horror, a deformity,
that would presently be disavowed or explained. There was no nose, and the
thing had dull bulging eyes at the side--in the silhouette I had supposed
they were ears. There were no ears.... I have tried to draw one of these
heads, but I cannot. There was a mouth, downwardly curved, like a human
mouth in a face that stares ferociously....
The neck on which the head was poised was jointed in three places, almost
like the short joints in the leg of a crab. The joints of the limbs I
could not see, because of the puttee-like straps in which they were
swathed, and which formed the only clothing the being wore.
There the thing was, looking at us!
At the time my mind was taken up by the mad impossibility of the creature.
I suppose he also was amazed, and with more reason, perhaps, for amazement
than we. Only, confound him! he did not show it. We did at least know what
had brought about this meeting of incompatible creatures. But conceive how
it would seem to decent Londoners, for example, to come upon a couple of
living things, as big as men and absolutely unlike any other earthly
animals, careering about among the sheep in Hyde Park! It must have taken
him like that.
Figure us! We were bound hand and foot, fagged and filthy; our beards two
inches long, our faces scratched and bloody. Cavor you must imagine in his
knickerbockers (torn in several places by the bayonet scrub) his Jaegar
shirt and old cricket cap, his wiry hair wildly disordered, a tail to
every quarter of the heavens. In that blue light his face did not look red
but very dark, his lips and the drying blood upon my hands seemed black.
If possible I was in a worse plight than he, on account of the yellow
fungus into which I had jumped. Our jackets were unbuttoned, and our shoes
had been taken off and lay at our feet. And we were sitting with our backs
to this queer bluish light, peering at such a monster as Durer might have
invented.
Cavor broke the silence; started to speak, went hoarse, and cleared his
throat. Outside began a terrific bellowing, as if a mooncalf were in
trouble. It ended in a shriek, and everything was still again.
Presently the Selenite turned about, flickered into the shadow, stood for
a moment retrospective at the door, and then closed it on us; and once
more we were in that murmurous mystery of darkness into which we had
awakened.
Chapter 13
Mr. Cavor Makes Some Suggestions
For a time neither of us spoke. To focus together all the things we had
brought upon ourselves seemed beyond my mental powers.
"They've got us," I said at last.
"It was that fungus."
"Well--if I hadn't taken it we should have fainted and starved."
"We might have found the sphere."
I lost my temper at his persistence, and swore to myself. For a time we
hated one another in silence. I drummed with my fingers on the floor
between my knees, and gritted the links of my fetters together. Presently
I was forced to talk again.
"What do you make of it, anyhow?" I asked humbly.
"They are reasonable creatures--they can make things and do things.
Those lights we saw..."
He stopped. It was clear he could make nothing of it.
When he spoke again it was to confess, "After all, they are more human
than we had a right to expect. I suppose--"
He stopped irritatingly.
"Yes?"
"I suppose, anyhow--on any planet where there is an intelligent animal--it
will carry its brain case upward, and have hands, and walk erect."
Presently he broke away in another direction.
"We are some way in," he said. "I mean--perhaps a couple of thousand feet
or more."
"Why?"
"It's cooler. And our voices are so much louder. That faded quality--it
has altogether gone. And the feeling in one's ears and throat."
I had not noted that, but I did now.
"The air is denser. We must be some depths--a mile even, we may
be--inside the moon."
"We never thought of a world inside the moon."
"No."
"How could we?"
"We might have done. Only one gets into habits of mind."
He thought for a time.
"Now," he said, "it seems such an obvious thing."
"Of course! The moon must be enormously cavernous, with an atmosphere
within, and at the centre of its caverns a sea.
"One knew that the moon had a lower specific gravity than the earth, one
knew that it had little air or water outside, one knew, too, that it was
sister planet to the earth, and that it was unaccountable that it should
be different in composition. The inference that it was hollowed out was as
clear as day. And yet one never saw it as a fact. Kepler, of course--"
His voice had the interest now of a man who has discerned a pretty
sequence of reasoning.
"Yes," he said, "Kepler with his sub-volvani was right after all."
"I wish you had taken the trouble to find that out before we came,"
I said.
He answered nothing, buzzing to himself softly, as he pursued his
thoughts. My temper was going.
"What do you think has become of the sphere, anyhow?" I asked.
"Lost," he said, like a man who answers an uninteresting question.
"Among those plants?"
"Unless they find it."
"And then?"
"How can I tell?"
"Cavor," I said, with a sort of hysterical bitterness, "things look bright
for my Company..."
He made no answer.
"Good Lord!" I exclaimed. "Just think of all the trouble we took to get
into this pickle! What did we come for? What are we after? What was the
moon to us or we to the moon? We wanted too much, we tried too much. We
ought to have started the little things first. It was you proposed the
moon! Those Cavorite spring blinds! I am certain we could have worked them
for terrestrial purposes. Certain! Did you really understand what I
proposed? A steel cylinder--"
"Rubbish!" said Cavor.
We ceased to converse.
For a time Cavor kept up a broken monologue without much help from me.
"If they find it," he began, "if they find it ... what will they do with
it? Well, that's a question. It may be that's _the_ question. They won't
understand it, anyhow. If they understood that sort of thing they would
have come long since to the earth. Would they? Why shouldn't they? But
they would have sent something--they couldn't keep their hands off such a
possibility. No! But they will examine it. Clearly they are intelligent
and inquisitive. They will examine it--get inside it--trifle with the
studs. Off! ... That would mean the moon for us for all the rest of our
lives. Strange creatures, strange knowledge...."
"As for strange knowledge--" said I, and language failed me.
"Look here, Bedford," said Cavor, "you came on this expedition of your own
free will."
"You said to me, 'Call it prospecting'."
"There's always risks in prospecting."
"Especially when you do it unarmed and without thinking out every
possibility."
"I was so taken up with the sphere. The thing rushed on us, and carried us
away."
"Rushed on _me_, you mean."
"Rushed on me just as much. How was I to know when I set to work on
molecular physics that the business would bring me here--of all places?"
"It's this accursed science," I cried. "It's the very Devil. The medieval
priests and persecutors were right and the Moderns are all wrong. You
tamper with it--and it offers you gifts. And directly you take them it
knocks you to pieces in some unexpected way. Old passions and new
weapons--now it upsets your religion, now it upsets your social ideas,
now it whirls you off to desolation and misery!"
"Anyhow, it's no use your quarrelling with me now. These creatures--these
Selenites, or whatever we choose to call them--have got us tied
hand and foot. Whatever temper you choose to go through with it in, you
will have to go through with it.... We have experiences before us that
will need all our coolness."
He paused as if he required my assent. But I sat sulking. "Confound your
science!" I said.
"The problem is communication. Gestures, I fear, will be different.
Pointing, for example. No creatures but men and monkeys point."
That was too obviously wrong for me. "Pretty nearly every animal," I
cried, "points with its eyes or nose."
Cavor meditated over that. "Yes," he said at last, "and we don't. There's
such differences--such differences!"
"One might.... But how can I tell? There is speech. The sounds they make,
a sort of fluting and piping. I don't see how we are to imitate that. Is
it their speech, that sort of thing? They may have different senses,
different means of communication. Of course they are minds and we are
minds; there must be something in common. Who knows how far we may not get
to an understanding?"
"The things are outside us," I said. "They're more different from us than
the strangest animals on earth. They are a different clay. What is the
good of talking like this?"
Cavor thought. "I don't see that. Where there are minds they will have
something similar--even though they have been evolved on different
planets. Of course if it was a question of instincts, if we or they are
no more than animals--"
"Well, are they? They're much more like ants on their hind legs than human
beings, and who ever got to any sort of understanding with ants?"
"But these machines and clothing! No, I don't hold with you, Bedford. The
difference is wide--"
"It's insurmountable."
"The resemblance must bridge it. I remember reading once a paper by the
late Professor Galton on the possibility of communication between the
planets. Unhappily, at that time it did not seem probable that that would
be of any material benefit to me, and I fear I did not give it the
attention I should have done--in view of this state of affairs. Yet....
Now, let me see!
"His idea was to begin with those broad truths that must underlie all
conceivable mental existences and establish a basis on those. The great
principles of geometry, to begin with. He proposed to take some leading
proposition of Euclid's, and show by construction that its truth was known
to us, to demonstrate, for example, that the angles at the base of an
isosceles triangle are equal, and that if the equal sides be produced the
angles on the other side of the base are equal also, or that the square on
the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the
squares on the two other sides. By demonstrating our knowledge of these
things we should demonstrate our possession of a reasonable
intelligence.... Now, suppose I ... I might draw the geometrical figure
with a wet finger, or even trace it in the air...."
He fell silent. I sat meditating his words. For a time his wild hope of
communication, of interpretation, with these weird beings held me. Then
that angry despair that was a part of my exhaustion and physical misery
resumed its sway. I perceived with a sudden novel vividness the
extraordinary folly of everything I had ever done. "Ass!" I said; "oh,
ass, unutterable ass.... I seem to exist only to go about doing
preposterous things. Why did we ever leave the thing? ... Hopping about
looking for patents and concessions in the craters of the moon!... If only
we had had the sense to fasten a handkerchief to a stick to show where we
had left the sphere!"
I subsided, fuming.
"It is clear," meditated Cavor, "they are intelligent. One can
hypothecate certain things. As they have not killed us at once, they
must have ideas of mercy. Mercy! at any rate of restraint. Possibly of
intercourse. They may meet us. And this apartment and the glimpses we had
of its guardian. These fetters! A high degree of intelligence..."
"I wish to heaven," cried I, "I'd thought even twice! Plunge after plunge.
First one fluky start and then another. It was my confidence in you! Why
didn't I stick to my play? That was what I was equal to. That was my
world and the life I was made for. I could have finished that play. I'm
certain ... it was a good play. I had the scenario as good as done.
Then.... Conceive it! leaping to the moon! Practically--I've thrown my
life away! That old woman in the inn near Canterbury had better sense."
I looked up, and stopped in mid-sentence. The darkness had given place to
that bluish light again. The door was opening, and several noiseless
Selenites were coming into the chamber. I became quite still, staring at
their grotesque faces.
Then suddenly my sense of disagreeable strangeness changed to interest. I
perceived that the foremost and second carried bowls. One elemental need
at least our minds could understand in common. They were bowls of some
metal that, like our fetters, looked dark in that bluish light; and each
contained a number of whitish fragments. All the cloudy pain and misery
that oppressed me rushed together and took the shape of hunger. I eyed
these bowls wolfishly, and, though it returned to me in dreams, at that
time it seemed a small matter that at the end of the arms that lowered one
towards me were not hands, but a sort of flap and thumb, like the end of
an elephant's trunk. The stuff in the bowl was loose in texture, and
whitish brown in colour--rather like lumps of some cold souffle, and it
smelt faintly like mushrooms. From a partially divided carcass of a
mooncalf that we presently saw, I am inclined to believe it must have been
mooncalf flesh.
My hands were so tightly chained that I could barely contrive to reach the
bowl; but when they saw the effort I made, two of them dexterously
released one of the turns about my wrist. Their tentacle hands were soft
and cold to my skin. I immediately seized a mouthful of the food. It had
the same laxness in texture that all organic structures seem to have upon
the moon; it tasted rather like a gauffre or a damp meringue, but in no
way was it disagreeable. I took two other mouthfuls. "I wanted--foo'!"
said I, tearing off a still larger piece....
For a time we ate with an utter absence of self-consciousness. We ate and
presently drank like tramps in a soup kitchen. Never before nor since have
I been hungry to the ravenous pitch, and save that I have had this very
experience I could never have believed that, a quarter of a million of
miles out of our proper world, in utter perplexity of soul, surrounded,
watched, touched by beings more grotesque and inhuman than the worst
creations of a nightmare, it would be possible for me to eat in utter
forgetfulness of all these things. They stood about us watching us, and
ever and again making a slight elusive twittering that stood, I suppose,
in the stead of speech. I did not even shiver at their touch. And when the
first zeal of my feeding was over, I could note that Cavor, too, had been
eating with the same shameless abandon.
Chapter 14
Experiments in intercourse
When at last we had made an end of eating, the Selenites linked our hands
closely together again, and then untwisted the chains about our feet and
rebound them, so as to give us a limited freedom of movement. Then they
unfastened the chains about our waists. To do all this they had to handle
us freely, and ever and again one of their queer heads came down close to
my face, or a soft tentacle-hand touched my head or neck. I don't remember
that I was afraid then or repelled by their proximity. I think that our
incurable anthropomorphism made us imagine there were human heads inside
their masks. The skin, like everything else, looked bluish, but that was
on account of the light; and it was hard and shiny, quite in the
beetle-wing fashion, not soft, or moist, or hairy, as a vertebrated
animal's would be. Along the crest of the head was a low ridge of whitish
spines running from back to front, and a much larger ridge curved on
either side over the eyes. The Selenite who untied me used his mouth to
help his hands.
"They seem to be releasing us," said Cavor. "Remember we are on the moon!
Make no sudden movements!"
"Are you going to try that geometry?"
"If I get a chance. But, of course, they may make an advance first."
We remained passive, and the Selenites, having finished their
arrangements, stood back from us, and seemed to be looking at us. I say
seemed to be, because as their eyes were at the side and not in front, one
had the same difficulty in determining the direction in which they were
looking as one has in the case of a hen or a fish. They conversed with one
another in their reedy tones, that seemed to me impossible to imitate or
define. The door behind us opened wider, and, glancing over my shoulder, I
saw a vague large space beyond, in which quite a little crowd of Selenites
were standing. They seemed a curiously miscellaneous rabble.
"Do they want us to imitate those sounds?" I asked Cavor.
"I don't think so," he said.
"It seems to me that they are trying to make us understand something."
"I can't make anything of their gestures. Do you notice this one, who is
worrying with his head like a man with an uncomfortable collar?"
"Let us shake our heads at him."
We did that, and finding it ineffectual, attempted an imitation of the
Selenites' movements. That seemed to interest them. At any rate they all
set up the same movement. But as that seemed to lead to nothing, we
desisted at last and so did they, and fell into a piping argument among
themselves. Then one of them, shorter and very much thicker than the
others, and with a particularly wide mouth, squatted down suddenly beside
Cavor, and put his hands and feet in the same posture as Cavor's were
bound, and then by a dexterous movement stood up.
"Cavor," I shouted, "they want us to get up!"
He stared open-mouthed. "That's it!" he said.
And with much heaving and grunting, because our hands were tied together,
we contrived to struggle to our feet. The Selenites made way for our
elephantine heavings, and seemed to twitter more volubly. As soon as we
were on our feet the thick-set Selenite came and patted each of our faces
with his tentacles, and walked towards the open doorway. That also was
plain enough, and we followed him. We saw that four of the Selenites
standing in the doorway were much taller than the others, and clothed in
the same manner as those we had seen in the crater, namely, with spiked
round helmets and cylindrical body-cases, and that each of the four
carried a goad with spike and guard made of that same dull-looking metal
as the bowls. These four closed about us, one on either side of each of
us, as we emerged from our chamber into the cavern from which the light
had come.
We did not get our impression of that cavern all at once. Our attention
was taken up by the movements and attitudes of the Selenites immediately
about us, and by the necessity of controlling our motion, lest we should
startle and alarm them and ourselves by some excessive stride. In front of
us was the short, thick-set being who had solved the problem of asking us
to get up, moving with gestures that seemed, almost all of them,
intelligible to us, inviting us to follow him. His spout-like face turned
from one of us to the other with a quickness that was clearly
interrogative. For a time, I say, we were taken up with these things.
But at last the great place that formed a background to our movements
asserted itself. It became apparent that the source of much, at least, of
the tumult of sounds which had filled our ears ever since we had recovered
from the stupefaction of the fungus was a vast mass of machinery in active
movement, whose flying and whirling parts were visible indistinctly over
the heads and between the bodies of the Selenites who walked about us. And
not only did the web of sounds that filled the air proceed from this
mechanism, but also the peculiar blue light that irradiated the whole
place. We had taken it as a natural thing that a subterranean cavern
should be artificially lit, and even now, though the fact was patent to my
eyes, I did not really grasp its import until presently the darkness came.
The meaning and structure of this huge apparatus we saw I cannot explain,
because we neither of us learnt what it was for or how it worked. One
after another, big shafts of metal flung out and up from its centre, their
heads travelling in what seemed to me to be a parabolic path; each dropped
a sort of dangling arm as it rose towards the apex of its flight and
plunged down into a vertical cylinder, forcing this down before it. About
it moved the shapes of tenders, little figures that seemed vaguely
different from the beings about us. As each of the three dangling arms of
the machine plunged down, there was a clank and then a roaring, and out of
the top of the vertical cylinder came pouring this incandescent substance
that lit the place, and ran over as milk runs over a boiling pot, and
dripped luminously into a tank of light below. It was a cold blue light, a
sort of phosphorescent glow but infinitely brighter, and from the tanks
into which it fell it ran in conduits athwart the cavern.
Thud, thud, thud, thud, came the sweeping arms of this unintelligible
apparatus, and the light substance hissed and poured. At first the thing
seemed only reasonably large and near to us, and then I saw how
exceedingly little the Selenites upon it seemed, and I realised the full
immensity of cavern and machine. I looked from this tremendous affair to
the faces of the Selenites with a new respect. I stopped, and Cavor
stopped, and stared at this thunderous engine.
"But this is stupendous!" I said. "What can it be for?"
Cavor's blue-lit face was full of an intelligent respect. "I can't dream!
Surely these beings-- Men could not make a thing like that! Look at those
arms, are they on connecting rods?"
The thick-set Selenite had gone some paces unheeded. He came back and
stood between us and the great machine. I avoided seeing him, because I
guessed somehow that his idea was to beckon us onward. He walked away in
the direction he wished us to go, and turned and came back, and flicked
our faces to attract our attention.
Cavor and I looked at one another.
"Cannot we show him we are interested in the machine?" I said.
"Yes," said Cavor. "We'll try that." He turned to our guide and smiled,
and pointed to the machine, and pointed again, and then to his head, and
then to the machine. By some defect of reasoning he seemed to imagine that
broken English might help these gestures. "Me look 'im," he said, "me
think 'im very much. Yes."
His behaviour seemed to check the Selenites in their desire for our
progress for a moment. They faced one another, their queer heads moved,
the twittering voices came quick and liquid. Then one of them, a lean,
tall creature, with a sort of mantle added to the puttee in which the
others were dressed, twisted his elephant trunk of a hand about Cavor's
waist, and pulled him gently to follow our guide, who again went on ahead.
Cavor resisted. "We may just as well begin explaining ourselves now. They
may think we are new animals, a new sort of mooncalf perhaps! It is most
important that we should show an intelligent interest from the outset."
He began to shake his head violently. "No, no," he said, "me not come on
one minute. Me look at 'im."
"Isn't there some geometrical point you might bring in apropos of that
affair?" I suggested, as the Selenites conferred again.
"Possibly a parabolic--" he began.
He yelled loudly, and leaped six feet or more!
One of the four armed moon-men had pricked him with a goad!
I turned on the goad-bearer behind me with a swift threatening gesture,
and he started back. This and Cavor's sudden shout and leap clearly
astonished all the Selenites. They receded hastily, facing us. For one of
those moments that seem to last for ever, we stood in angry protest, with
a scattered semicircle of these inhuman beings about us.
"He pricked me!" said Cavor, with a catching of the voice.
"I saw him," I answered.
"Confound it!" I said to the Selenites; "we're not going to stand that!
What on earth do you take us for?"
I glanced quickly right and left. Far away across the blue wilderness of
cavern I saw a number of other Selenites running towards us; broad and
slender they were, and one with a larger head than the others. The cavern
spread wide and low, and receded in every direction into darkness. Its
roof, I remember, seemed to bulge down as if with the weight of the vast
thickness of rocks that prisoned us. There was no way out of it--no way
out of it. Above, below, in every direction, was the unknown, and these
inhuman creatures, with goads and gestures, confronting us, and we two
unsupported men!
Chapter 15
The Giddy Bridge
Just for a moment that hostile pause endured. I suppose that both we and
the Selenites did some very rapid thinking. My clearest impression was
that there was nothing to put my back against, and that we were bound to
be surrounded and killed. The overwhelming folly of our presence there
loomed over me in black, enormous reproach. Why had I ever launched
myself on this mad, inhuman expedition?
Cavor came to my side and laid his hand on my arm. His pale and terrified
face was ghastly in the blue light.
"We can't do anything," he said. "It's a mistake. They don't understand.
We must go. As they want us to go."
I looked down at him, and then at the fresh Selenites who were coming to
help their fellows. "If I had my hands free--"
"It's no use," he panted.
"No."
"We'll go."
And he turned about and led the way in the direction that had been
indicated for us.
I followed, trying to look as subdued as possible, and feeling at the
chains about my wrists. My blood was boiling. I noted nothing more of that
cavern, though it seemed to take a long time before we had marched across
it, or if I noted anything I forgot it as I saw it. My thoughts were
concentrated, I think, upon my chains and the Selenites, and particularly
upon the helmeted ones with the goads. At first they marched parallel with
us, and at a respectful distance, but presently they were overtaken by
three others, and then they drew nearer, until they were within arms
length again. I winced like a beaten horse as they came near to us. The
shorter, thicker Selenite marched at first on our right flank, but
presently came in front of us again.
How well the picture of that grouping has bitten into my brain; the back
of Cavor's downcast head just in front of me, and the dejected droop of
his shoulders, and our guide's gaping visage, perpetually jerking about
him, and the goad-bearers on either side, watchful, yet open-mouthed--a
blue monochrome. And after all, I do remember one other thing besides the
purely personal affair, which is, that a sort of gutter came presently
across the floor of the cavern, and then ran along by the side of the path
of rock we followed. And it was full of that same bright blue luminous
stuff that flowed out of the great machine. I walked close beside it, and
I can testify it radiated not a particle of heat. It was brightly shining,
and yet it was neither warmer nor colder than anything else in the cavern.
Clang, clang, clang, we passed right under the thumping levers of another
vast machine, and so came at last to a wide tunnel, in which we could even
hear the pad, pad, of our shoeless feet, and which, save for the trickling
thread of blue to the right of us, was quite unlit. The shadows made
gigantic travesties of our shapes and those of the Selenites on the
irregular wall and roof of the tunnel. Ever and again crystals in the
walls of the tunnel scintillated like gems, ever and again the tunnel
expanded into a stalactitic cavern, or gave off branches that vanished
into darkness.
We seemed to be marching down that tunnel for a long time. "Trickle,
trickle," went the flowing light very softly, and our footfalls and their
echoes made an irregular paddle, paddle. My mind settled down to the
question of my chains. If I were to slip off one turn _so_, and then to
twist it _so_ ...
If I tried to do it very gradually, would they see I was slipping my wrist
out of the looser turn? If they did, what would they do?
"Bedford," said Cavor, "it goes down. It keeps on going down."
His remark roused me from my sullen pre-occupation.
"If they wanted to kill us," he said, dropping back to come level with me,
"there is no reason why they should not have done it."
"No," I admitted, "that's true."
"They don't understand us," he said, "they think we are merely strange
animals, some wild sort of mooncalf birth, perhaps. It will be only
when they have observed us better that they will begin to think we
have minds--"
"When you trace those geometrical problems," said I.
"It may be that."
We tramped on for a space.
"You see," said Cavor, "these may be Selenites of a lower class."
"The infernal fools!" said I viciously, glancing at their exasperating
faces.
"If we endure what they do to us--"
"We've got to endure it," said I.
"There may be others less stupid. This is the mere outer fringe of their
world. It must go down and down, cavern, passage, tunnel, down at last to
the sea--hundreds of miles below."
His words made me think of the mile or so of rock and tunnel that might be
over our heads already. It was like a weight dropping, on my shoulders.
"Away from the sun and air," I said. "Even a mine half a mile deep is
stuffy."
"This is not, anyhow. It's probable--Ventilation! The air would blow
from the dark side of the moon to the sunlit, and all the carbonic acid
would well out there and feed those plants. Up this tunnel, for example,
there is quite a breeze. And what a world it must be. The earnest we have
in that shaft, and those machines--"
"And the goad," I said. "Don't forget the goad!"
He walked a little in front of me for a time.
"Even that goad--" he said.
"Well?"
"I was angry at the time. But--it was perhaps necessary we should get on.
They have different skins, and probably different nerves. They may not
understand our objection--just as a being from Mars might not like our
earthly habit of nudging."
"They'd better be careful how they nudge me."
"And about that geometry. After all, their way is a way of understanding,
too. They begin with the elements of life and not of thought. Food.
Compulsion. Pain. They strike at fundamentals."
"There's no doubt about that," I said.
He went on to talk of the enormous and wonderful world into which we were
being taken. I realised slowly from his tone, that even now he was not
absolutely in despair at the prospect of going ever deeper into this
inhuman planet-burrow. His mind ran on machines and invention, to the
exclusion of a thousand dark things that beset me. It wasn't that he
intended to make any use of these things, he simply wanted to know them.
"After all," he said, "this is a tremendous occasion. It is the meeting
of two worlds! What are we going to see? Think of what is below us here."
"We shan't see much if the light isn't better," I remarked.
"This is only the outer crust. Down below-- On this scale-- There will
be everything. Do you notice how different they seem one from another?
The story we shall take back!"
"Some rare sort of animal," I said, "might comfort himself in that way
while they were bringing him to the Zoo.... It doesn't follow that we are
going to be shown all these things."
"When they find we have reasonable minds," said Cavor, "they will want to
learn about the earth. Even if they have no generous emotions, they will
teach in order to learn.... And the things they must know! The
unanticipated things!"
He went on to speculate on the possibility of their knowing things he had
never hoped to learn on earth, speculating in that way, with a raw wound
from that goad already in his skin! Much that he said I forget, for my
attention was drawn to the fact that the tunnel along which we had been
marching was opening out wider and wider. We seemed, from the feeling of
the air, to be going out into a huge space. But how big the space might
really be we could not tell, because it was unlit. Our little stream of
light ran in a dwindling thread and vanished far ahead. Presently the
rocky walls had vanished altogether on either hand. There was nothing to
be seen but the path in front of us and the trickling hurrying rivulet of
blue phosphorescence. The figures of Cavor and the guiding Selenite
marched before me, the sides of their legs and heads that were towards the
rivulet were clear and bright blue, their darkened sides, now that the
reflection of the tunnel wall no longer lit them, merged indistinguishably
in the darkness beyond.
And soon I perceived that we were approaching a declivity of some sort,
because the little blue stream dipped suddenly out of sight.
In another moment, as it seemed, we had reached the edge. The shining
stream gave one meander of hesitation and then rushed over. It fell to a
depth at which the sound of its descent was absolutely lost to us. Far
below was a bluish glow, a sort of blue mist--at an infinite distance
below. And the darkness the stream dropped out of became utterly void and
black, save that a thing like a plank projected from the edge of the cliff
and stretched out and faded and vanished altogether. There was a warm air
blowing up out of the gulf.
For a moment I and Cavor stood as near the edge as we dared, peering into
a blue-tinged profundity. And then our guide was pulling at my arm.
Then he left me, and walked to the end of that plank and stepped upon it,
looking back. Then when he perceived we watched him, he turned about and
went on along it, walking as surely as though he was on firm earth. For a
moment his form was distinct, then he became a blue blur, and then
vanished into the obscurity. I became aware of some vague shape looming
darkly out of the black.
There was a pause. "Surely!--" said Cavor.
One of the other Selenites walked a few paces out upon the plank, and
turned and looked back at us unconcernedly. The others stood ready to
follow after us. Our guide's expectant figure reappeared. He was returning
to see why we had not advanced.
"What is that beyond there?" I asked.
"I can't see."
"We can't cross this at any price," said I.
"I could not go three steps on it," said Cavor, "even with my hands free."
We looked at each other's drawn faces in blank consternation.
"They can't know what it is to be giddy!" said Cavor.
"It's quite impossible for us to walk that plank."
"I don't believe they see as we do. I've been watching them. I wonder if
they know this is simply blackness for us. How can we make them
understand?"
"Anyhow, we must make them understand."
I think we said these things with a vague half hope the Selenites might
somehow understand. I knew quite clearly that all that was needed was an
explanation. Then as I saw their faces, I realised that an explanation was
impossible. Just here it was that our resemblances were not going to
bridge our differences. Well, I wasn't going to walk the plank, anyhow. I
slipped my wrist very quickly out of the coil of chain that was loose, and
then began to twist my wrists in opposite directions. I was standing
nearest to the bridge, and as I did this two of the Selenites laid hold of
me, and pulled me gently towards it.
I shook my head violently. "No go," I said, "no use. You don't
understand."
Another Selenite added his compulsion. I was forced to step forward.
"I've got an idea," said Cavor; but I knew his ideas.
"Look here!" I exclaimed to the Selenites. "Steady on! It's all very well
for you--"
I sprang round upon my heel. I burst out into curses. For one of the armed
Selenites had stabbed me behind with his goad.
I wrenched my wrists free from the little tentacles that held them. I
turned on the goad-bearer. "Confound you!" I cried. "I've warned you of
that. What on earth do you think I'm made of, to stick that into me? If
you touch me again--"
By way of answer he pricked me forthwith.
I heard Cavor's voice in alarm and entreaty. Even then I think he wanted
to compromise with these creatures. "I say, Bedford," he cried, "I know a
way!" But the sting of that second stab seemed to set free some pent-up
reserve of energy in my being. Instantly the link of the wrist-chain
snapped, and with it snapped all considerations that had held us
unresisting in the hands of these moon creatures. For that second, at
least, I was mad with fear and anger. I took no thought of consequences.
I hit straight out at the face of the thing with the goad. The chain was
twisted round my fist.
There came another of these beastly surprises of which the moon world is
full.
My mailed hand seemed to go clean through him. He smashed like--like
some softish sort of sweet with liquid in it! He broke right in! He
squelched and splashed. It was like hitting a damp toadstool. The flimsy
body went spinning a dozen yards, and fell with a flabby impact. I was
astonished. I was incredulous that any living thing could be so flimsy.
For an instant I could have believed the whole thing a dream.
Then it had become real and imminent again. Neither Cavor nor the other
Selenites seemed to have done anything from the time when I had turned
about to the time when the dead Selenite hit the ground. Every one stood
back from us two, every one alert. That arrest seemed to last at least a
second after the Selenite was down. Every one must have been taking the
thing in. I seem to remember myself standing with my arm half retracted,
trying also to take it in. "What next?" clamoured my brain; "what next?"
Then in a moment every one was moving!
I perceived we must get our chains loose, and that before we could do this
these Selenites had to be beaten off. I faced towards the group of the
three goad-bearers. Instantly one threw his goad at me. It swished over
my head, and I suppose went flying into the abyss behind.
I leaped right at him with all my might as the goad flew over me. He
turned to run as I jumped, and I bore him to the ground, came down right
upon him, and slipped upon his smashed body and fell. He seemed to wriggle
under my foot.
I came into a sitting position, and on every hand the blue backs of the
Selenites were receding into the darkness. I bent a link by main force and
untwisted the chain that had hampered me about the ankles, and sprang to
my feet, with the chain in my hand. Another goad, flung javelin-wise,
whistled by me, and I made a rush towards the darkness out of which it had
come. Then I turned back towards Cavor, who was still standing in the
light of the rivulet near the gulf convulsively busy with his wrists, and
at the same time jabbering nonsense about his idea.
"Come on!" I cried.
"My hands!" he answered.
Then, realising that I dared not run back to him, because my
ill-calculated steps might carry me over the edge, he came shuffling
towards me, with his hands held out before him.
I gripped his chains at once to unfasten them.
"Where are they?" he panted.
"Run away. They'll come back. They're throwing things! Which way shall we
go?"
"By the light. To that tunnel. Eh?"
"Yes," said I, and his hands were free.
I dropped on my knees and fell to work on his ankle bonds. Whack came
something--I know not what--and splashed the livid streamlet into drops
about us. Far away on our right a piping and whistling began.
I whipped the chain off his feet, and put it in his hand. "Hit with that!"
I said, and without waiting for an answer, set off in big bounds along
the path by which we had come. I had a nasty sort of feeling that these
things could jump out of the darkness on to my back. I heard the impact of
his leaps come following after me.
We ran in vast strides. But that running, you must understand, was an
altogether different thing from any running on earth. On earth one leaps
and almost instantly hits the ground again, but on the moon, because of
its weaker pull, one shot through the air for several seconds before one
came to earth. In spite of our violent hurry this gave an effect of long
pauses, pauses in which one might have counted seven or eight. "Step,"
and one soared off! All sorts of questions ran through my mind: "Where are
the Selenites? What will they do? Shall we ever get to that tunnel? Is
Cavor far behind? Are they likely to cut him off?" Then whack, stride, and
off again for another step.
I saw a Selenite running in front of me, his legs going exactly as a man's
would go on earth, saw him glance over his shoulder, and heard him shriek
as he ran aside out of my way into the darkness. He was, I think, our
guide, but I am not sure. Then in another vast stride the walls of rock
had come into view on either hand, and in two more strides I was in the
tunnel, and tempering my pace to its low roof. I went on to a bend, then
stopped and turned back, and plug, plug, plug, Cavor came into view,
splashing into the stream of blue light at every stride, and grew larger
and blundered into me. We stood clutching each other. For a moment, at
least, we had shaken off our captors and were alone.
We were both very much out of breath. We spoke in panting, broken
sentences.
"You've spoilt it all!" panted Cavor. "Nonsense," I cried. "It was that
or death!"
"What are we to do?"
"Hide."
"How can we?"
"It's dark enough."
"But where?"
"Up one of these side caverns."
"And then?"
"Think."
"Right--come on."
We strode on, and presently came to a radiating dark cavern. Cavor was in
front. He hesitated, and chose a black mouth that seemed to promise good
hiding. He went towards it and turned.
"It's dark," he said.
"Your legs and feet will light us. You're wet with that luminous stuff."
"But--"
A tumult of sounds, and in particular a sound like a clanging gong,
advancing up the main tunnel, became audible. It was horribly suggestive
of a tumultuous pursuit. We made a bolt for the unlit side cavern
forthwith. As we ran along it our way was lit by the irradiation of
Cavor's legs. "It's lucky," I panted, "they took off our boots, or we
should fill this place with clatter." On we rushed, taking as small steps
as we could to avoid striking the roof of the cavern. After a time we
seemed to be gaining on the uproar. It became muffled, it dwindled, it
died away.
I stopped and looked back, and I heard the pad, pad of Cavor's feet
receding. Then he stopped also. "Bedford," he whispered; "there's a sort
of light in front of us."
I looked, and at first could see nothing. Then I perceived his head and
shoulders dimly outlined against a fainter darkness. I saw, also, that
this mitigation of the darkness was not blue, as all the other light
within the moon had been, but a pallid gray, a very vague, faint white,
the daylight colour. Cavor noted this difference as soon, or sooner, than
I did, and I think, too, that it filled him with much the same wild hope.
"Bedford," he whispered, and his voice trembled. "That light--it is
possible--"
He did not dare to say the thing he hoped. Then came a pause. Suddenly I
knew by the sound of his feet that he was striding towards that pallor. I
followed him with a beating heart.
Chapter 16
Points of View
The light grew stronger as we advanced. In a little time it was nearly as
strong as the phosphorescence on Cavor's legs. Our tunnel was expanding
into a cavern, and this new light was at the farther end of it. I
perceived something that set my hopes leaping and bounding.
"Cavor," I said, "it comes from above! I am certain it comes from above!"
He made no answer, but hurried on.
Indisputably it was a gray light, a silvery light.
In another moment we were beneath it. It filtered down through a chink in
the walls of the cavern, and as I stared up, drip, came a drop of water
upon my face. I started and stood aside--drip, fell another drop quite
audibly on the rocky floor.
"Cavor," I said, "if one of us lifts the other, he can reach that crack!"
"I'll lift you," he said, and incontinently hoisted me as though I was a
baby.
I thrust an arm into the crack, and just at my finger tips found a little
ledge by which I could hold. I could see the white light was very much
brighter now. I pulled myself up by two fingers with scarcely an effort,
though on earth I weigh twelve stone, reached to a still higher corner of
rock, and so got my feet on the narrow ledge. I stood up and searched up
the rocks with my fingers; the cleft broadened out upwardly. "It's
climbable," I said to Cavor. "Can you jump up to my hand if I hold it down
to you?"
I wedged myself between the sides of the cleft, rested knee and foot on
the ledge, and extended a hand. I could not see Cavor, but I could hear
the rustle of his movements as he crouched to spring. Then whack and he
was hanging to my arm--and no heavier than a kitten! I lugged him up
until he had a hand on my ledge, and could release me.
"Confound it!" I said, "any one could be a mountaineer on the moon;" and
so set myself in earnest to the climbing. For a few minutes I clambered
steadily, and then I looked up again. The cleft opened out steadily, and
the light was brighter. Only--
It was not daylight after all.
In another moment I could see what it was, and at the sight I could have
beaten my head against the rocks with disappointment. For I beheld simply
an irregularly sloping open space, and all over its slanting floor stood a
forest of little club-shaped fungi, each shining gloriously with that
pinkish silvery light. For a moment I stared at their soft radiance, then
sprang forward and upward among them. I plucked up half a dozen and flung
them against the rocks, and then sat down, laughing bitterly, as Cavor's
ruddy face came into view.
"It's phosphorescence again!" I said. "No need to hurry. Sit down and make
yourself at home." And as he spluttered over our disappointment, I began
to lob more of these growths into the cleft.
"I thought it was daylight," he said.
"Daylight!" cried I. "Daybreak, sunset, clouds, and windy skies! Shall we
ever see such things again?"
As I spoke, a little picture of our world seemed to rise before me, bright
and little and clear, like the background of some old Italian picture.
"The sky that changes, and the sea that changes, and the hills and the
green trees and the towns and cities shining in the sun. Think of a wet
roof at sunset, Cavor! Think of the windows of a westward house!" He made
no answer.
"Here we are burrowing in this beastly world that isn't a world, with its
inky ocean hidden in some abominable blackness below, and outside that
torrid day and that death stillness of night. And all these things that
are chasing us now, beastly men of leather--insect men, that come out of
a nightmare! After all, they're right! What business have we here smashing
them and disturbing their world! For all we know the whole planet is up
and after us already. In a minute we may hear them whimpering, and their
gongs going. What are we to do? Where are we to go? Here we are as
comfortable as snakes from Jamrach's loose in a Surbiton villa!"
"It was your fault," said Cavor.
"My fault!" I shouted. "Good Lord!"
"I had an idea!"
"Curse your ideas!"
"If we had refused to budge--"
"Under those goads?"
"Yes. They would have carried us!"
"Over that bridge?"
"Yes. They must have carried us from outside."
"I'd rather be carried by a fly across a ceiling."
"Good Heavens!"
I resumed my destruction of the fungi. Then suddenly I saw something that
struck me even then. "Cavor," I said, "these chains are of gold!"
He was thinking intently, with his hands gripping his cheeks. He turned
his head slowly and stared at me, and when I had repeated my words, at the
twisted chain about his right hand. "So they are," he said, "so they
are." His face lost its transitory interest even as he looked. He
hesitated for a moment, then went on with his interrupted meditation. I
sat for a space puzzling over the fact that I had only just observed this,
until I considered the blue light in which we had been, and which had
taken all the colour out of the metal. And from that discovery I also
started upon a train of thought that carried me wide and far. I forgot
that I had just been asking what business we had in the moon. Gold....
It was Cavor who spoke first. "It seems to me that there are two courses
open to us."
"Well?"
"Either we can attempt to make our way--fight our way if necessary--out
to the exterior again, and then hunt for our sphere until we find it, or
the cold of the night comes to kill us, or else--"
He paused. "Yes?" I said, though I knew what was coming.
"We might attempt once more to establish some sort of understanding with
the minds of the people in the moon."
"So far as I'm concerned--it's the first."
"I doubt."
"I don't."
"You see," said Cavor, "I do not think we can judge the Selenites by what
we have seen of them. Their central world, their civilised world will be
far below in the profounder caverns about their sea. This region of the
crust in which we are is an outlying district, a pastoral region. At any
rate, that is my interpretation. These Selenites we have seen may be only
the equivalent of cowboys and engine-tenders. Their use of goads--in all
probability mooncalf goads--the lack of imagination they show in expecting
us to be able to do just what they can do, their indisputable brutality,
all seem to point to something of that sort. But if we endured--"
"Neither of us could endure a six-inch plank across the bottomless pit for
very long."
"No," said Cavor; "but then--"
"I _won't_," I said.
He discovered a new line of possibilities. "Well, suppose we got ourselves
into some corner, where we could defend ourselves against these hinds and
labourers. If, for example, we could hold out for a week or so, it is
probable that the news of our appearance would filter down to the more
intelligent and populous parts--"
"If they exist."
"They must exist, or whence came those tremendous machines?"
"That's possible, but it's the worst of the two chances."
"We might write up inscriptions on walls--"
"How do we know their eyes would see the sort of marks we made?"
"If we cut them--"
"That's possible, of course."
I took up a new thread of thought. "After all," I said, "I suppose you
don't think these Selenites so infinitely wiser than men."
"They must know a lot more--or at least a lot of different things."
"Yes, but--" I hesitated.
"I think you'll quite admit, Cavor, that you're rather an exceptional
man."
"How?"
"Well, you--you're a rather lonely man--have been, that is. You haven't
married."
"Never wanted to. But why--"
"And you never grew richer than you happened to be?"
"Never wanted that either."
"You've just rooted after knowledge?"
"Well, a certain curiosity is natural--"
"You think so. That's just it. You think every other mind wants to know. I
remember once, when I asked you why you conducted all these researches,
you said you wanted your F.R.S., and to have the stuff called Cavorite,
and things like that. You know perfectly well you didn't do it for that;
but at the time my question took you by surprise, and you felt you ought
to have something to look like a motive. Really you conducted researches
because you had to. It's your twist."
"Perhaps it is--"
"It isn't one man in a million has that twist. Most men want--well,
various things, but very few want knowledge for its own sake. I don't, I
know perfectly well. Now, these Selenites seem to be a driving, busy sort
of being, but how do you know that even the most intelligent will take an
interest in us or our world? I don't believe they'll even know we have a
world. They never come out at night--they'd freeze if they did. They've
probably never seen any heavenly body at all except the blazing sun. How
are they to know there is another world? What does it matter to them if
they do? Well, even if they have had a glimpse of a few stars, or even of
the earth crescent, what of that? Why should people living inside a
planet trouble to observe that sort of thing? Men wouldn't have done it
except for the seasons and sailing; why should the moon people?...
"Well, suppose there are a few philosophers like yourself. They are just
the very Selenites who'll never have heard of our existence. Suppose a
Selenite had dropped on the earth when you were at Lympne, you'd have
been the last man in the world to hear he had come. You never read a
newspaper! You see the chances against you. Well, it's for these chances
we're sitting here doing nothing while precious time is flying. I tell you
we've got into a fix. We've come unarmed, we've lost our sphere, we've got
no food, we've shown ourselves to the Selenites, and made them think we're
strange, strong, dangerous animals; and unless these Selenites are perfect
fools, they'll set about now and hunt us till they find us, and when they
find us they'll try to take us if they can, and kill us if they can't, and
that's the end of the matter. If they take us, they'll probably kill us,
through some misunderstanding. After we're done for, they may discuss us
perhaps, but we shan't get much fun out of that."
"Go on."
"On the other hand, here's gold knocking about like cast iron at home. If
only we can get some of it back, if only we can find our sphere again
before they do, and get back, then--"
"Yes?"
"We might put the thing on a sounder footing. Come back in a bigger
sphere with guns."
"Good Lord!" cried Cavor, as though that was horrible.
I shied another luminous fungus down the cleft.
"Look here, Cavor," I said, "I've half the voting power anyhow in this
affair, and this is a case for a practical man. I'm a practical man, and
you are not. I'm not going to trust to Selenites and geometrical diagrams
if I can help it. That's all. Get back. Drop all this secrecy--or most
of it. And come again."
He reflected. "When I came to the moon," he said, "I ought to have come
alone."
"The question before the meeting," I said, "is how to get back to the
sphere."
For a time we nursed our knees in silence. Then he seemed to decide for my
reasons.
"I think," he said, "one can get data. It is clear that while the sun is
on this side of the moon the air will be blowing through this planet
sponge from the dark side hither. On this side, at any rate, the air will
be expanding and flowing out of the moon caverns into the craters....
Very well, there's a draught here."
"So there is."
"And that means that this is not a dead end; somewhere behind us this
cleft goes on and up. The draught is blowing up, and that is the way we
have to go. If we try to get up any sort of chimney or gully there is, we
shall not only get out of these passages where they are hunting for us--"
"But suppose the gully is too narrow?"
"We'll come down again."
"Ssh!" I said suddenly; "what's that?"
We listened. At first it was an indistinct murmur, and then one picked out
the clang of a gong. "They must think we are mooncalves," said I, "to be
frightened at that."
"They're coming along that passage," said Cavor.
"They must be."
"They'll not think of the cleft. They'll go past."
I listened again for a space. "This time," I whispered, "they're likely to
have some sort of weapon."
Then suddenly I sprang to my feet. "Good heavens, Cavor!" I cried. "But
they will! They'll see the fungi I have been pitching down. They'll--"
I didn't finish my sentence. I turned about and made a leap over the
fungus tops towards the upper end of the cavity. I saw that the space
turned upward and became a draughty cleft again, ascending to impenetrable
darkness. I was about to clamber up into this, and then with a happy
inspiration turned back.
"What are you doing?" asked Cavor.
"Go on!" said I, and went back and got two of the shining fungi, and
putting one into the breast pocket of my flannel jacket, so that it stuck
out to light our climbing, went back with the other for Cavor. The noise
of the Selenites was now so loud that it seemed they must be already
beneath the cleft. But it might be they would have difficulty in
clambering in to it, or might hesitate to ascend it against our possible
resistance. At any rate, we had now the comforting knowledge of the
enormous muscular superiority our birth in another planet gave us. In
other minute I was clambering with gigantic vigour after Cavor's blue-lit
heels.
Chapter 17
The Fight in the Cave of the Moon Butchers
I do not know how far we clambered before we came to the grating. It may
be we ascended only a few hundred feet, but at the time it seemed to me we
might have hauled and jammed and hopped and wedged ourselves through a
mile or more of vertical ascent. Whenever I recall that time, there comes
into my head the heavy clank of our golden chains that followed every
movement. Very soon my knuckles and knees were raw, and I had a bruise on
one cheek. After a time the first violence of our efforts diminished, and
our movements became more deliberate and less painful. The noise of the
pursuing Selenites had died away altogether. It seemed almost as though
they had not traced us up the crack after all, in spite of the tell-tale
heap of broken fungi that must have lain beneath it. At times the cleft
narrowed so much that we could scarce squeeze up it; at others it expanded
into great drusy cavities, studded with prickly crystals or thickly beset
with dull, shining fungoid pimples. Sometimes it twisted spirally, and at
other times slanted down nearly to the horizontal direction. Ever and
again there was the intermittent drip and trickle of water by us. Once or
twice it seemed to us that small living things had rustled out of our
reach, but what they were we never saw. They may have been venomous beasts
for all I know, but they did us no harm, and we were now tuned to a pitch
when a weird creeping thing more or less mattered little. And at last, far
above, came the familiar bluish light again, and then we saw that it
filtered through a grating that barred our way.
We whispered as we pointed this out to one another, and became more and
more cautious in our ascent. Presently we were close under the grating,
and by pressing my face against its bars I could see a limited portion of
the cavern beyond. It was clearly a large space, and lit no doubt by some
rivulet of the same blue light that we had seen flow from the beating
machinery. An intermittent trickle of water dropped ever and again between
the bars near my face.
My first endeavour was naturally to see what might be upon the floor of
the cavern, but our grating lay in a depression whose rim hid all this
from our eyes. Our foiled attention then fell back upon the suggestion of
the various sounds we heard, and presently my eye caught a number of faint
shadows that played across the dim roof far overhead.
Indisputably there were several Selenites, perhaps a considerable number,
in this space, for we could hear the noises of their intercourse, and
faint sounds that I identified as their footfalls. There was also a
succession of regularly repeated sounds--chid, chid, chid--which began
and ceased, suggestive of a knife or spade hacking at some soft substance.
Then came a clank as if of chains, a whistle and a rumble as of a truck
running over a hollowed place, and then again that chid, chid, chid
resumed. The shadows told of shapes that moved quickly and rhythmically,
in agreement with that regular sound, and rested when it ceased.
We put our heads close together, and began to discuss these things in
noiseless whispers.
"They are occupied," I said, "they are occupied in some way."
"Yes."
"They're not seeking us, or thinking of us."
"Perhaps they have not heard of us."
"Those others are hunting about below. If suddenly we appeared here--"
We looked at one another.
"There might be a chance to parley," said Cavor.
"No," I said. "Not as we are."
For a space we remained, each occupied by his own thoughts.
Chid, chid, chid went the chipping, and the shadows moved to and fro.
I looked at the grating. "It's flimsy," I said. "We might bend two of the
bars and crawl through."
We wasted a little time in vague discussion. Then I took one of the bars
in both hands, and got my feet up against the rock until they were almost
on a level with my head, and so thrust against the bar. It bent so
suddenly that I almost slipped. I clambered about and bent the adjacent
bar in the opposite direction, and then took the luminous fungus from my
pocket and dropped it down the fissure.
"Don't do anything hastily," whispered Cavor, as I twisted myself up
through the opening I had enlarged. I had a glimpse of busy figures as I
came through the grating, and immediately bent down, so that the rim of
the depression in which the grating lay hid me from their eyes, and so lay
flat, signalling advice to Cavor as he also prepared to come through.
Presently we were side by side in the depression, peering over the edge at
the cavern and its occupants.
It was a much larger cavern than we had supposed from our first glimpse of
it, and we looked up from the lowest portion of its sloping floor. It
widened out as it receded from us, and its roof came down and hid the
remoter portion altogether. And lying in a line along its length,
vanishing at last far away in that tremendous perspective, were a number
of huge shapes, huge pallid hulls, upon which the Selenites were busy. At
first they seemed big white cylinders of vague import. Then I noted the
heads upon them lying towards us, eyeless and skinless like the heads of
sheep at a butcher's, and perceived they were the carcasses of mooncalves
being cut up, much as the crew of a whaler might cut up a moored whale.
They were cutting off the flesh in strips, and on some of the farther
trunks the white ribs were showing. It was the sound of their hatchets
that made that chid, chid, chid. Some way away a thing like a trolley
cable, drawn and loaded with chunks of lax meat, was running up the slope
of the cavern floor. This enormous long avenue of hulls that were destined
to be food gave us a sense of the vast populousness of the moon world
second only to the effect of our first glimpse down the shaft.
It seemed to me at first that the Selenites must be standing on
trestle-supported planks,[*] and then I saw that the planks and supports
and the hatchets were really of the same leaden hue as my fetters had
seemed before white light came to bear on them. A number of very
thick-looking crowbars lay about the floor, and had apparently assisted
to turn the dead mooncalf over on its side. They were perhaps six feet
long, with shaped handles, very tempting-looking weapons. The whole
place was lit by three transverse streams of the blue fluid.
[* Footnote: I do not remember seeing any wooden things on the moon; doors
tables, everything corresponding to our terrestrial joinery was made of
metal, and I believe for the most part of gold, which as a metal would,
of course, naturally recommend itself--other things being equal--on
account of the ease in working it, and its toughness and durability.]
We lay for a long time noting all these things in silence. "Well?" said
Cavor at last.
I crouched over and turned to him. I had come upon a brilliant idea.
"Unless they lowered those bodies by a crane," I said, "we must be nearer
the surface than I thought."
"Why?"
"The mooncalf doesn't hop, and it hasn't got wings."
He peered over the edge of the hollow again. "I wonder now--" he began.
"After all, we have never gone far from the surface--"
I stopped him by a grip on his arm. I had heard a noise from the cleft
below us!
We twisted ourselves about, and lay as still as death, with every sense
alert. In a little while I did not doubt that something was quietly
ascending the cleft. Very slowly and quite noiselessly I assured myself
of a good grip on my chain, and waited for that something to appear.
"Just look at those chaps with the hatchets again," I said.
"They're all right," said Cavor.
I took a sort of provisional aim at the gap in the grating. I could hear
now quite distinctly the soft twittering of the ascending Selenites, the
dab of their hands against the rock, and the falling of dust from their
grips as they clambered.
Then I could see that there was something moving dimly in the blackness
below the grating, but what it might be I could not distinguish. The whole
thing seemed to hang fire just for a moment--then smash! I had sprung
to my feet, struck savagely at something that had flashed out at me. It
was the keen point of a spear. I have thought since that its length in the
narrowness of the cleft must have prevented its being sloped to reach me.
Anyhow, it shot out from the grating like the tongue of a snake, and
missed and flew back and flashed again. But the second time I snatched and
caught it, and wrenched it away, but not before another had darted
ineffectually at me.
I shouted with triumph as I felt the hold of the Selenite resist my pull
for a moment and give, and then I was jabbing down through the bars,
amidst squeals from the darkness, and Cavor had snapped off the other
spear, and was leaping and flourishing it beside me, and making
inefficient jabs. Clang, clang, came up through the grating, and then an
axe hurtled through the air and whacked against the rocks beyond, to
remind me of the fleshers at the carcasses up the cavern.
I turned, and they were all coming towards us in open order waving their
axes. They were short, thick, little beggars, with long arms, strikingly
different from the ones we had seen before. If they had not heard of us
before, they must have realised the situation with incredible swiftness. I
stared at them for a moment, spear in hand. "Guard that grating, Cavor," I
cried, howled to intimidate them, and rushed to meet them. Two of them
missed with their hatchets, and the rest fled incontinently. Then the two
also were sprinting away up the cavern, with hands clenched and heads
down. I never saw men run like them!
I knew the spear I had was no good for me. It was thin and flimsy, only
effectual for a thrust, and too long for a quick recover. So I only chased
the Selenites as far as the first carcass, and stopped there and picked up
one of the crowbars that were lying about. It felt comfortingly heavy, and
equal to smashing any number of Selenites. I threw away my spear, and
picked up a second crowbar for the other hand. I felt five times better
than I had with the spear. I shook the two threateningly at the Selenites,
who had come to a halt in a little crowd far away up the cavern, and then
turned about to look at Cavor.
He was leaping from side to side of the grating, making threatening jabs
with his broken spear. That was all right. It would keep the Selenites
down--for a time at any rate. I looked up the cavern again. What on earth
were we going to do now?
We were cornered in a sort of way already. But these butchers up the
cavern had been surprised, they were probably scared, and they had no
special weapons, only those little hatchets of theirs. And that way lay
escape. Their sturdy little forms--ever so much shorter and thicker than
the mooncalf herds--were scattered up the slope in a way that was
eloquent of indecision. I had the moral advantage of a mad bull in a
street. But for all that, there seemed a tremendous crowd of them. Very
probably there was. Those Selenites down the cleft had certainly some
infernally long spears. It might be they had other surprises for us....
But, confound it! if we charged up the cave we should let them up behind
us, and if we didn't those little brutes up the cave would probably get
reinforced. Heaven alone knew what tremendous engines of warfare--guns,
bombs, terrestrial torpedoes--this unknown world below our feet, this
vaster world of which we had only pricked the outer cuticle, might not
presently send up to our destruction. It became clear the only thing to do
was to charge! It became clearer as the legs of a number of fresh
Selenites appeared running down the cavern towards us.
"Bedford!" cried Cavor, and behold! he was halfway between me and the
grating.
"Go back!" I cried. "What are you doing--"
"They've got--it's like a gun!"
And struggling in the grating between those defensive spears appeared the
head and shoulders of a singularly lean and angular Selenite, bearing some
complicated apparatus.
I realised Cavor's utter incapacity for the fight we had in hand. For a
moment I hesitated. Then I rushed past him whirling my crowbars, and
shouting to confound the aim of the Selenite. He was aiming in the
queerest way with the thing against his stomach. "Chuzz!" The thing
wasn't a gun; it went off like cross-bow more, and dropped me in the
middle of a leap.
I didn't fall down, I simply came down a little shorter than I should have
done if I hadn't been hit, and from the feel of my shoulder the thing
might have tapped me and glanced off. Then my left hand hit again the
shaft, and I perceived there was a sort of spear sticking half through my
shoulder. The moment after I got home with the crowbar in my right hand,
and hit the Selenite fair and square. He collapsed--he crushed and
crumpled--his head smashed like an egg.
I dropped a crowbar, pulled the spear out of my shoulder, and began to jab
it down the grating into the darkness. At each jab came a shriek and
twitter. Finally I hurled the spear down upon them with all my strength,
leapt up, picked up the crowbar again, and started for the multitude up
the cavern.
"Bedford!" cried Cavor. "Bedford!" as I flew past him.
I seem to remember his footsteps coming on behind me.
Step, leap ... whack, step, leap.... Each leap seemed to last ages. With
each, the cave opened out and the number of Selenites visible increased.
At first they seemed all running about like ants in a disturbed ant-hill,
one or two waving hatchets and coming to meet me, more running away, some
bolting sideways into the avenue of carcasses, then presently others came
in sight carrying spears, and then others. I saw a most extraordinary
thing, all hands and feet, bolting for cover. The cavern grew darker
farther up.
Flick! something flew over my head. Flick! As I soared in mid-stride I saw
a spear hit and quiver in one of the carcasses to my left. Then, as I came
down, one hit the ground before me, and I heard the remote chuzz! with
which their things were fired. Flick, flick! for a moment it was a
shower. They were volleying!
I stopped dead.
I don't think I thought clearly then. I seem to remember a kind of
stereotyped phrase running through my mind: "Zone of fire, seek cover!" I
know I made a dash for the space between two of the carcasses, and stood
there panting and feeling very wicked.
I looked round for Cavor, and for a moment it seemed as if he had vanished
from the world. Then he came out of the darkness between the row of the
carcasses and the rocky wall of the cavern. I saw his little face, dark
and blue, and shining with perspiration and emotion.
He was saying something, but what it was I did not heed. I had realised
that we might work from mooncalf to mooncalf up the cave until we were
near enough to charge home. It was charge or nothing. "Come on!" I said,
and led the way.
"Bedford!" he cried unavailingly.
My mind was busy as we went up that narrow alley between the dead bodies
and the wall of the cavern. The rocks curved about--they could not
enfilade us. Though in that narrow space we could not leap, yet with our
earth-born strength we were still able to go very much faster than the
Selenites. I reckoned we should presently come right among them. Once
we were on them, they would be nearly as formidable as black beetles.
Only there would first of all be a volley. I thought of a stratagem.
I whipped off my flannel jacket as I ran.
"Bedford!" panted Cavor behind me.
I glanced back. "What?" said I.
He was pointing upward over the carcasses. "White light!" he said. "White
light again!"
I looked, and it was even so; a faint white ghost of light in the remoter
cavern roof. That seemed to give me double strength.
"Keep close," I said. A flat, long Selenite dashed out of the darkness,
and squealed and fled. I halted, and stopped Cavor with my hand. I hung my
jacket over my crowbar, ducked round the next carcass, dropped jacket and
crowbar, showed myself, and darted back.
"Chuzz-flick," just one arrow came. We were close on the Selenites, and
they were standing in a crowd, broad, short, and tall together, with a
little battery of their shooting implements pointing down the cave. Three
or four other arrows followed the first, then their fire ceased.
I stuck out my head, and escaped by a hair's-breadth. This time I drew a
dozen shots or more, and heard the Selenites shouting and twittering as if
with excitement as they shot. I picked up jacket and crowbar again.
"Now!" said I, and thrust out the jacket.
"Chuzz-zz-zz-zz! Chuzz!" In an instant my jacket had grown a thick beard
of arrows, and they were quivering all over the carcass behind us.
Instantly I slipped the crowbar out of the jacket, dropped the jacket--for
all I know to the contrary it is lying up there in the moon now--and
rushed out upon them.
For a minute perhaps it was massacre. I was too fierce to discriminate,
and the Selenites were probably too scared to fight. At any rate they made
no sort of fight against me. I saw scarlet, as the saying is. I remember I
seemed to be wading among those leathery, thin things as a man wades
through tall grass, mowing and hitting, first right, then left; smash.
Little drops of moisture flew about. I trod on things that crushed and
piped and went slippery. The crowd seemed to open and close and flow like
water. They seemed to have no combined plan whatever. There were spears
flew about me, I was grazed over the ear by one. I was stabbed once in the
arm and once in the cheek, but I only found that out afterwards, when the
blood had had time to run and cool and feel wet.
What Cavor did I do not know. For a space it seemed that this fighting had
lasted for an age, and must needs go on for ever. Then suddenly it was all
over, and there was nothing to be seen but the backs of heads bobbing up
and down as their owners ran in all directions.... I seemed altogether
unhurt. I ran forward some paces, shouting, then turned about. I was
amazed.
I had come right through them in vast flying strides, they were all behind
me, and running hither and thither to hide.
I felt an enormous astonishment at the evaporation of the great fight into
which I had hurled myself, and not a little exultation. It did not seem to
me that I had discovered the Selenites were unexpectedly flimsy, but that
I was unexpectedly strong. I laughed stupidly. This fantastic moon!
I glanced for a moment at the smashed and writhing bodies that were
scattered over the cavern floor, with a vague idea of further violence,
then hurried on after Cavor.
Chapter 18
In the Sunlight
Presently we saw that the cavern before us opened upon a hazy void. In
another moment we had emerged upon a sort of slanting gallery, that
projected into a vast circular space, a huge cylindrical pit running
vertically up and down. Round this pit the slanting gallery ran without
any parapet or protection for a turn and a half, and then plunged high
above into the rock again. Somehow it reminded me then one of those spiral
turns of the railway through the Saint Gothard. It was all tremendously
huge. I can scarcely hope to convey to you the Titanic proportion of all
that place, the Titanic effect of it. Our eyes followed up the vast
declivity of the pit wall, and overhead and far above we beheld a round
opening set with faint stars, and half of the lip about it well nigh
blinding with the white light of the sun. At that we cried aloud
simultaneously.
"Come on!" I said, leading the way.
"But there?" said Cavor, and very carefully stepped nearer the edge of the
gallery. I followed his example, and craned forward and looked down, but I
was dazzled by that gleam of light above, and I could see only a
bottomless darkness with spectral patches of crimson and purple floating
therein. Yet if I could not see, I could hear. Out of this darkness came a
sound, a sound like the angry hum one can hear if one puts one's ear
outside a hive of bees, a sound out of that enormous hollow, it may be,
four miles beneath our feet...
For a moment I listened, then tightened my grip on my crowbar, and led the
way up the gallery.
"This must be the shaft we looked down upon," said Cavor. "Under that
lid."
"And below there, is where we saw the lights."
"The lights!" said he. "Yes--the lights of the world that now we shall
never see."
"We'll come back," I said, for now we had escaped so much I was rashly
sanguine that we should recover the sphere.
His answer I did not catch.
"Eh?" I asked.
"It doesn't matter," he answered, and we hurried on in silence.
I suppose that slanting lateral way was four or five miles long, allowing
for its curvature, and it ascended at a slope that would have made it
almost impossibly steep on earth, but which one strode up easily under
lunar conditions. We saw only two Selenites during all that portion of our
flight, and directly they became aware of us they ran headlong. It was
clear that the knowledge of our strength and violence had reached them.
Our way to the exterior was unexpectedly plain. The spiral gallery
straightened into a steeply ascendent tunnel, its floor bearing abundant
traces of the mooncalves, and so straight and short in proportion to its
vast arch, that no part of it was absolutely dark. Almost immediately it
began to lighten, and then far off and high up, and quite blindingly
brilliant, appeared its opening on the exterior, a slope of Alpine
steepness surmounted by a crest of bayonet shrub, tall and broken down
now, and dry and dead, in spiky silhouette against the sun.
And it is strange that we men, to whom this very vegetation had seemed so
weird and horrible a little time ago, should now behold it with the
emotion a home-coming exile might feel at sight of his native land. We
welcomed even the rareness of the air that made us pant as we ran, and
which rendered speaking no longer the easy thing that it had been, but an
effort to make oneself heard. Larger grew the sunlit circle above us, and
larger, and all the nearer tunnel sank into a rim of indistinguishable
black. We saw the dead bayonet shrub no longer with any touch of green in
it, but brown and dry and thick, and the shadow of its upper branches
high out of sight made a densely interlaced pattern upon the tumbled
rocks. And at the immediate mouth of the tunnel was a wide trampled space
where the mooncalves had come and gone.
We came out upon this space at last into a light and heat that hit and
pressed upon us. We traversed the exposed area painfully, and clambered up
a slope among the scrub stems, and sat down at last panting in a high
place beneath the shadow of a mass of twisted lava. Even in the shade the
rock felt hot.
The air was intensely hot, and we were in great physical discomfort, but
for all that we were no longer in a nightmare. We seemed to have come to
our own province again, beneath the stars. All the fear and stress of our
flight through the dim passages and fissures below had fallen from us.
That last fight had filled us with an enormous confidence in ourselves so
far as the Selenites were concerned. We looked back almost incredulously
at the black opening from which we had just emerged. Down there it was, in
a blue glow that now in our memories seemed the next thing to absolute
darkness, we had met with things like mad mockeries of men, helmet-headed
creatures, and had walked in fear before them, and had submitted to them
until we could submit no longer. And behold, they had smashed like wax and
scattered like chaff, and fled and vanished like the creatures of a dream!
I rubbed my eyes, doubting whether we had not slept and dreamt these
things by reason of the fungus we had eaten, and suddenly discovered the
blood upon my face, and then that my shirt was sticking painfully to my
shoulder and arm.
"Confound it!" I said, gauging my injuries with an investigatory hand, and
suddenly that distant tunnel mouth became, as it were, a watching eye.
"Cavor!" I said; "what are they going to do now? And what are we going to
do?"
He shook his head, with his eyes fixed upon the tunnel. "How can one tell
what they will do?"
"It depends on what they think of us, and I don't see how we can begin to
guess that. And it depends upon what they have in reserve. It's as you
say, Cavor, we have touched the merest outside of this world. They may
have all sorts of things inside here. Even with those shooting things they
might make it bad for us....
"Yet after all," I said, "even if we don't find the sphere at once, there
is a chance for us. We might hold out. Even through the night. We might go
down there again and make a fight for it."
I stared about me with speculative eyes. The character of the scenery had
altered altogether by reason of the enormous growth and subsequent drying
of the scrub. The crest on which we sat was high, and commanded a wide
prospect of the crater landscape, and we saw it now all sere and dry in
the late autumn of the lunar afternoon. Rising one behind the other were
long slopes and fields of trampled brown where the mooncalves had
pastured, and far away in the full blaze of the sun a drove of them basked
slumberously, scattered shapes, each with a blot of shadow against it like
sheep on the side of a down. But never a sign of a Selenite was to be
seen. Whether they had fled on our emergence from the interior passages,
or whether they were accustomed to retire after driving out the
mooncalves, I cannot guess. At the time I believed the former was the
case.
"If we were to set fire to all this stuff," I said, "we might find the
sphere among the ashes."
Cavor did not seem to hear me. He was peering under his hand at the stars,
that still, in spite of the intense sunlight, were abundantly visible in
the sky. "How long do you think we've have been here?" he asked at last.
"Been where?"
"On the moon."
"Two earthly days, perhaps."
"More nearly ten. Do you know, the sun is past its zenith, and sinking in
the west. In four days' time or less it will be night."
"But--we've only eaten once!"
"I know that. And-- But there are the stars!"
"But why should time seem different because we are on a smaller planet?"
"I don't know. There it is!"
"How does one tell time?"
"Hunger--fatigue--all those things are different. Everything is
different--everything. To me it seems that since first we came out of the
sphere has been only a question of hours--long hours--at most."
"Ten days," I said; "that leaves--" I looked up at the sun for a moment,
and then saw that it was halfway from the zenith to the western edge of
things. "Four days! ... Cavor, we mustn't sit here and dream. How do you
think we may begin?"
I stood up. "We must get a fixed point we can recognise--we might hoist a
flag, or a handkerchief, or something--and quarter the ground, and work
round that."
He stood up beside me.
"Yes," he said, "there is nothing for it but to hunt the sphere. Nothing.
We may find it--certainly we may find it. And if not--"
"We must keep on looking."
He look this way and that, glanced up at the sky and down at the tunnel,
and astonished me by a sudden gesture of impatience. "Oh! but we have
done foolishly! To have come to this pass! Think how it might have been,
and the things we might have done!"
"We might do something yet."
"Never the thing we might have done. Here below out feet is a world.
Think of what that world must be! Think of that machine we saw, and the
lid and the shaft! They were just remote outlying things, and those
creatures we have seen and fought with no more than ignorant peasants,
dwellers in the outskirts, yokels and labourers half akin to brutes. Down
below! Caverns beneath caverns, tunnels, structures, ways... It must
open out, and be greater and wider and more populous as one descends.
Assuredly. Right down at the last the central sea that washes round the
core of the moon. Think of its inky waters under the spare lights--if,
indeed, their eyes need lights! Think of the cascading tributaries
pouring down their channels to feed it! Think of the tides upon its
surface, and the rush and swirl of its ebb and flow! perhaps they have
ships that go upon it, perhaps down there are mighty cities and swarming
ways, and wisdom and order passing the wit of man. And we may die here
upon it, and never see the masters who must be--ruling over these things!
We may freeze and die here, and the air will freeze and thaw upon us, and
then--! Then they will come upon us, come on our stiff and silent
bodies, and find the sphere we cannot find, and they will understand at
last too late all the thought and effort that ended here in vain!"
His voice for all that speech sounded like the voice of someone heard
in a telephone, weak and far away.
"But the darkness," I said.
"One might get over that."
"How?"
"I don't know. How am I to know? One might carry a torch, one might have
a lamp-- The others--might understand."
He stood for a moment with his hands held down and a rueful face, staring
out over the waste that defied him. Then with a gesture of renunciation
he turned towards me with proposals for the systematic hunting of the
sphere.
"We can return," I said.
He looked about him. "First of all we shall have to get to earth."
"We could bring back lamps to carry and climbing irons, and a hundred
necessary things."
"Yes," he said.
"We can take back an earnest of success in this gold."
He looked at my golden crowbars, and said nothing for a space. He stood
with his hands clasped behind his back, staring across the crater. At
last he signed and spoke. "It was I found the way here, but to find a way
isn't always to be master of a way. If I take my secret back to earth,
what will happen? I do not see how I can keep my secret for a year, for
even a part of a year. Sooner or later it must come out, even if other
men rediscover it. And then ... Governments and powers will struggle to
get hither, they will fight against one another, and against these moon
people; it will only spread warfare and multiply the occasions of war. In
a little while, in a very little while, if I tell my secret, this planet
to its deepest galleries will be strewn with human dead. Other things are
doubtful, but that is certain. It is not as though man had any use for the
moon. What good would the moon be to men? Even of their own planet what
have they made but a battle-ground and theatre of infinite folly? Small
as his world is, and short as his time, he has still in his little life
down there far more than he can do. No! Science has toiled too long
forging weapons for fools to use. It is time she held her hand. Let him
find it out for himself again--in a thousand years' time."
"There are methods of secrecy," I said.
He looked up at me and smiled. "After all," he said, "why should one
worry? There is little chance of our finding the sphere, and down below
things are brewing. It's simply the human habit of hoping till we die that
makes us think of return. Our troubles are only beginning. We have shown
these moon folk violence, we have given them a taste of our quality, and
our chances are about as good as a tiger's that has got loose and killed a
man in Hyde Park. The news of us must be running down from gallery to
gallery, down towards the central parts.... No sane beings will ever let
us take that sphere back to earth after so much as they have seen of us."
"We aren't improving our chances," said I, "by sitting here."
We stood up side by side.
"After all," he said, "we must separate. We must stick up a handkerchief on
these tall spikes here and fasten it firmly, and from this as a centre we
must work over the crater. You must go westward, moving out in semicircles
to and fro towards the setting sun. You must move first with your shadow
on your right until it is at right angles with the direction of your
handkerchief, and then with your shadow on your left. And I will do the
same to the east. We will look into every gully, examine every skerry of
rocks; we will do all we can to find my sphere. If we see the Selenites we
will hide from them as well as we can. For drink we must take snow, and if
we feel the need of food, we must kill a mooncalf if we can, and eat such
flesh as it has--raw--and so each will go his own way."
"And if one of us comes upon the sphere?"
"He must come back to the white handkerchief, and stand by it and signal
to the other."
"And if neither?"
Cavor glanced up at the sun. "We go on seeking until the night and cold
overtake us."
"Suppose the Selenites have found the sphere and hidden it?"
He shrugged his shoulders.
"Or if presently they come hunting us?"
He made no answer.
"You had better take a club," I said.
He shook his head, and stared away from me across the waste.
But for a moment he did not start. He looked round at me shyly, hesitated.
"Au revoir," he said.
I felt an odd stab of emotion. A sense of how we had galled each other,
and particularly how I must have galled him, came to me. "Confound it,"
thought I, "we might have done better!" I was on the point of asking him
to shake hands--for that, somehow, was how I felt just then--when he put
his feet together and leapt away from me towards the north. He seemed to
drift through the air as a dead leaf would do, fell lightly, and leapt
again. I stood for a moment watching him, then faced westward reluctantly,
pulled myself together, and with something of the feeling of a man who
leaps into icy water, selected a leaping point, and plunged forward to
explore my solitary half of the moon world. I dropped rather clumsily
among rocks, stood up and looked about me, clambered on to a rocky slab,
and leapt again....
When presently I looked for Cavor he was hidden from my eyes, but the
handkerchief showed out bravely on its headland, white in the blaze of the
sun.
I determined not to lose sight of that handkerchief whatever might betide.
Chapter 19
Mr. Bedford Alone
In a little while it seemed to me as though I had always been alone on the
moon. I hunted for a time with a certain intentness, but the heat was
still very great, and the thinness of the air felt like a hoop about one's
chest. I came presently into a hollow basin bristling with tall, brown,
dry fronds about its edge, and I sat down under these to rest and cool. I
intended to rest for only a little while. I put down my clubs beside me,
and sat resting my chin on my hands. I saw with a sort of colourless
interest that the rocks of the basin, where here and there the crackling
dry lichens had shrunk away to show them, were all veined and splattered
with gold, that here and there bosses of rounded and wrinkled gold
projected from among the litter. What did that matter now? A sort of
languor had possession of my limbs and mind, I did not believe for a moment
that we should ever find the sphere in that vast desiccated wilderness. I
seemed to lack a motive for effort until the Selenites should come. Then
I supposed I should exert myself, obeying that unreasonable imperative
that urges a man before all things to preserve and defend his life, albeit
he may preserve it only to die more painfully in a little while.
Why had we come to the moon?
The thing presented itself to me as a perplexing problem. What is this
spirit in man that urges him for ever to depart from happiness and
security, to toil, to place himself in danger, to risk even a reasonable
certainty of death? It dawned upon me up there in the moon as a thing I
ought always to have known, that man is not made simply to go about being
safe and comfortable and well fed and amused. Almost any man, if you put
the thing to him, not in words, but in the shape of opportunities, will
show that he knows as much. Against his interest, against his happiness, he
is constantly being driven to do unreasonable things. Some force not
himself impels him, and go he must. But why? Why? Sitting there in the
midst of that useless moon gold, amidst the things of another world, I
took count of all my life. Assuming I was to die a castaway upon the moon,
I failed altogether to see what purpose I had served. I got no light on
that point, but at any rate it was clearer to me than it had ever been in
my life before that I was not serving my own purpose, that all my life I
had in truth never served the purposes of my private life. Whose purposes,
what purposes, was I serving? ... I ceased to speculate on why we had come
to the moon, and took a wider sweep. Why had I come to the earth? Why had
I a private life at all? ... I lost myself at last in bottomless
speculations....
My thoughts became vague and cloudy, no longer leading in definite
directions. I had not felt heavy or weary--I cannot imagine one doing so
upon the moon--but I suppose I was greatly fatigued. At any rate I slept.
Slumbering there rested me greatly, I think, and the sun was setting and
the violence of the heat abating, through all the time I slumbered. When
at last I was roused from my slumbers by a remote clamour, I felt active
and capable again. I rubbed my eyes and stretched my arms. I rose to my
feet--I was a little stiff--and at once prepared to resume my search. I
shouldered my golden clubs, one on each shoulder, and went on out of the
ravine of the gold-veined rocks.
The sun was certainly lower, much lower than it had been; the air was very
much cooler. I perceived I must have slept some time. It seemed to me that
a faint touch of misty blueness hung about the western cliff I leapt to a
little boss of rock and surveyed the crater. I could see no signs of
mooncalves or Selenites, nor could I see Cavor, but I could see my
handkerchief far off, spread out on its thicket of thorns. I looked bout
me, and then leapt forward to the next convenient view-point.
I beat my round in a semicircle, and back again in a still remoter
crescent. It was very fatiguing and hopeless. The air was really very much
cooler, and it seemed to me that the shadow under the westward cliff was
growing broad. Ever and again I stopped and reconnoitred, but there was no
sign of Cavor, no sign of Selenites; and it seemed to me the mooncalves
must have been driven into the interior again--I could see none of them.
I became more and more desirous of seeing Cavor. The winged outline of the
sun had sunk now, until it was scarcely the distance of its diameter from
the rim of the sky. I was oppressed by the idea that the Selenites would
presently close their lids and valves, and shut us out under the
inexorable onrush of the lunar night. It seemed to me high time that he
abandoned his search, and that we took counsel together. I felt how urgent
it was that we should decide soon upon our course. We had failed to find
the sphere, we no longer had time to seek it, and once these valves were
closed with us outside, we were lost men. The great night of space would
descend upon us--that blackness of the void which is the only absolute
death. All my being shrank from that approach. We must get into the moon
again, though we were slain in doing it. I was haunted by a vision of our
freezing to death, of our hammering with our last strength on the valve of
the great pit.
I took no thought any more of the sphere. I thought only of finding Cavor
again. I was half inclined to go back into the moon without him, rather
than seek him until it was too late. I was already half-way back towards
our handkerchief, when suddenly--
I saw the sphere!
I did not find it so much as it found me. It was lying much farther to the
westward than I had gone, and the sloping rays of the sinking sun
reflected from its glass had suddenly proclaimed its presence in a
dazzling beam. For an instant I thought this was some new device of the
Selenites against us, and then I understood.
I threw up my arms, shouted a ghostly shout, and set off in vast leaps
towards it. I missed one of my leaps and dropped into a deep ravine and
twisted my ankle, and after that I stumbled at almost every leap. I was
in a state of hysterical agitation, trembling violently, and quite
breathless long before I got to it. Three times at least I had to stop
with my hands resting on my side and in spite of the thin dryness of the
air, the perspiration was wet upon my face.
I thought of nothing but the sphere until I reached it, I forgot even my
trouble of Cavor's whereabouts. My last leap flung me with my hands hard
against its glass; then I lay against it panting, and trying vainly to
shout, "Cavor! here is the sphere!" When I had recovered a little I peered
through the thick glass, and the things inside seemed tumbled. I stooped
to peer closer. Then I attempted to get in. I had to hoist it over a
little to get my head through the manhole. The screw stopper was inside,
and I could see now that nothing had been touched, nothing had suffered.
It lay there as we had left it when we had dropped out amidst the snow.
For a time I was wholly occupied in making and remaking this inventory. I
found I was trembling violently. It was good to see that familiar dark
interior again! I cannot tell you how good. Presently I crept inside and
sat down among the things. I looked through the glass at the moon world
and shivered. I placed my gold clubs upon the table, and sought out and
took a little food; not so much because I wanted it, but because it was
there. Then it occurred to me that it was time to go out and signal for
Cavor. But I did not go out and signal for Cavor forthwith. Something
held me to the sphere.
After all, everything was coming right. There would be still time for us
to get more of the magic stone that gives one mastery over men. Away
there, close handy, was gold for the picking up; and the sphere would
travel as well half full of gold as though it were empty. We could go
back now, masters of ourselves and our world, and then--
I roused myself at last, and with an effort got myself out of the sphere.
I shivered as I emerged, for the evening air was growing very cold. I
stood in the hollow staring about me. I scrutinised the bushes round me
very carefully before I leapt to the rocky shelf hard by, and took once
more what had been my first leap in the moon. But now I made it with no
effort whatever.
The growth and decay of the vegetation had gone on apace, and the whole
aspect of the rocks had changed, but still it was possible to make out the
slope on which the seeds had germinated, and the rocky mass from which we
had taken our first view of the crater. But the spiky shrub on the slope
stood brown and sere now, and thirty feet high, and cast long shadows that
stretched out of sight, and the little seeds that clustered in its upper
branches were brown and ripe. Its work was done, and it was brittle and
ready to fall and crumple under the freezing air, so soon as the nightfall
came. And the huge cacti, that had swollen as we watched them, had long
since burst and scattered their spores to the four quarters of the moon.
Amazing little corner in the universe--the landing place of men!
Some day, thought I, I will have an inscription standing there right in
the midst of the hollow. It came to me, if only this teeming world within
knew of the full import of the moment, how furious its tumult would
become!
But as yet it could scarcely be dreaming of the significance of our
coming. For if it did, the crater would surely be an uproar of pursuit,
instead of as still as death! I looked about for some place from which I
might signal Cavor, and saw that same patch of rock to which he had leapt
from my present standpoint, still bare and barren in the sun. For a moment
I hesitated at going so far from the sphere. Then with a pang of shame at
that hesitation, I leapt....
From this vantage point I surveyed the crater again. Far away at the top
of the enormous shadow I cast was the little white handkerchief fluttering
on the bushes. It was very little and very far, and Cavor was not in
sight. It seemed to me that by this time he ought to be looking for me.
That was the agreement. But he was nowhere to be seen.
I stood waiting and watching, hands shading my eyes, expecting every
moment to distinguish him. Very probably I stood there for quite a long
time. I tried to shout, and was reminded of the thinness of the air. I
made an undecided step back towards the sphere. But a lurking dread of
the Selenites made me hesitate to signal my whereabouts by hoisting one of
our sleeping-blankets on to the adjacent scrub. I searched the crater
again.
It had an effect of emptiness that chilled me. And it was still. Any
sound from the Selenites in the world beneath had died away. It was as
still as death. Save for the faint stir of the shrub about me in the
little breeze that was rising, there was no sound nor shadow of a sound.
And the breeze blew chill.
Confound Cavor!
I took a deep breath. I put my hands to the sides of my mouth. "Cavor!" I
bawled, and the sound was like some manikin shouting far away.
I looked at the handkerchief, I looked behind me at the broadening shadow
of the westward cliff, I looked under my hand at the sun. It seemed to me
that almost visibly it was creeping down the sky.
I felt I must act instantly if I was to save Cavor. I whipped off my vest
and flung it as a mark on the sere bayonets of the shrubs behind me, and
then set off in a straight line towards the handkerchief. Perhaps it was
a couple of miles away--a matter of a few hundred leaps and strides. I
have already told how one seemed to hang through those lunar leaps. In
each suspense I sought Cavor, and marvelled why he should be hidden. In
each leap I could feel the sun setting behind me. Each time I touched
the ground I was tempted to go back.
A last leap and I was in the depression below our handkerchief, a stride,
and I stood on our former vantage point within arms' reach of it. I stood
up straight and scanned the world about me, between its lengthening bars
of shadow. Far away, down a long declivity, was the opening of the tunnel
up which we had fled, and my shadow reached towards it, stretched towards
it, and touched it, like a finger of the night.
Not a sign of Cavor, not a sound in all the stillness, only the stir and
waving of the scrub and of the shadows increased. And suddenly and
violently I shivered. "Cav--" I began, and realised once more the
uselessness of the human voice in that thin air. Silence. The silence of
death.
Then it was my eye caught something--a little thing lying, perhaps fifty
yards away down the slope, amidst a litter of bent and broken branches.
What was it? I knew, and yet for some reason I would not know. I went
nearer to it. It was the little cricket-cap Cavor had worn. I did not
touch it, I stood looking at it.
I saw then that the scattered branches about it had been forcibly smashed
and trampled. I hesitated, stepped forward, and picked it up.
I stood with Cavor's cap in my hand, staring at the trampled reeds and
thorns about me. On some, of them were little smears of something dark,
something that I dared not touch. A dozen yards away, perhaps, the rising
breeze dragged something into view, something small and vividly white.
It was a little piece of paper crumpled tightly, as though it had been
clutched tightly. I picked it up, and on it were smears of red. My eye
caught faint pencil marks. I smoothed it out, and saw uneven and broken
writing ending at last in a crooked streak up on the paper.
I set myself to decipher this.
"I have been injured about the knee, I think my kneecap is hurt, and I
cannot run or crawl," it began--pretty distinctly written.
Then less legibly: "They have been chasing me for some time, and it is
only a question of"--the word "time" seemed to have been written here and
erased in favour of something illegible--"before they get me. They are
beating all about me."
Then the writing became convulsive. "I can hear them," I guessed the
tracing meant, and then it was quite unreadable for a space. Then came a
little string of words that were quite distinct: "a different sort of
Selenite altogether, who appears to be directing the--" The writing
became a mere hasty confusion again.
"They have larger brain cases--much larger, and slenderer bodies, and
very short legs. They make gentle noises, and move with organized
deliberation...
"And though I am wounded and helpless here, their appearance still gives
me hope." That was like Cavor. "They have not shot at me or attempted...
injury. I intend--"
Then came the sudden streak of the pencil across the paper, and on the
back and edges--blood!
And as I stood there stupid, and perplexed, with this dumbfounding relic
in my hand, something very soft and light and chill touched my hand for a
moment and ceased to be, and then a thing, a little white speck, drifted
athwart a shadow. It was a tiny snowflake, the first snowflake, the herald
of the night.
I looked up with a start, and the sky had darkened almost to blackness,
and was thick with a gathering multitude of coldly watchful stars. I
looked eastward, and the light of that shrivelled world was touched with
sombre bronze; westward, and the sun robbed now by a thickening white mist
of half its heat and splendour, was touching the crater rim, was sinking
out of sight, and all the shrubs and jagged and tumbled rocks stood out
against it in a bristling disorder of black shapes. Into the great lake
of darkness westward, a vast wreath of mist was sinking. A cold wind set
all the crater shivering. Suddenly, for a moment, I was in a puff of
falling snow, and all the world about me gray and dim.
And then it was I heard, not loud and penetrating as at first, but faint
and dim like a dying voice, that tolling, that same tolling that had
welcomed the coming of the day: Boom!... Boom!... Boom!...
It echoed about the crater, it seemed to throb with the throbbing of the
greater stars, the blood-red crescent of the sun's disc sank as it tolled
out: Boom!... Boom!... Boom!...
What had happened to Cavor? All through that tolling I stood there
stupidly, and at last the tolling ceased.
And suddenly the open mouth of the tunnel down below there, shut like an
eye and vanished out of sight.
Then indeed was I alone.
Over me, around me, closing in on me, embracing me ever nearer, was the
Eternal; that which was before the beginning, and that which triumphs over
the end; that enormous void in which all light and life and being is but
the thin and vanishing splendour of a falling star, the cold, the
stillness, the silence--the infinite and final Night of space.
The sense of solitude and desolation became the sense of an overwhelming
presence that stooped towards me, that almost touched me.
"No," I cried. "No! Not yet! not yet! Wait! Wait! Oh, wait!" My voice
went up to a shriek. I flung the crumpled paper from me, scrambled back
to the crest to take my bearings, and then, with all the will that was in
me, leapt out towards the mark I had left, dim and distant now in the very
margin of the shadow.
Leap, leap, leap, and each leap was seven ages.
Before me the pale serpent-girdled section of the sun sank and sank, and
the advancing shadow swept to seize the sphere before I could reach it. I
was two miles away, a hundred leaps or more, and the air about me was
thinning out as it thins under an air-pump, and the cold was gripping at
my joints. But had I died, I should have died leaping. Once, and then
again my foot slipped on the gathering snow as I leapt and shortened my
leap; once I fell short into bushes that crashed and smashed into dusty
chips and nothingness, and once I stumbled as I dropped and rolled head
over heels into a gully, and rose bruised and bleeding and confused as to
my direction.
But such incidents were as nothing to the intervals, those awful pauses
when one drifted through the air towards that pouring tide of night. My
breathing made a piping noise, and it was as though knives were whirling
in my lungs. My heart seemed to beat against the top of my brain. "Shall I
reach it? O Heaven! Shall I reach it?"
My whole being became anguish.
"Lie down!" screamed my pain and despair; "lie down!"
The nearer I struggled, the more awfully remote it seemed. I was numb,
I stumbled, I bruised and cut myself and did not bleed.
It was in sight.
I fell on all fours, and my lungs whooped.
I crawled. The frost gathered on my lips, icicles hung from my moustache,
I was white with the freezing atmosphere.
I was a dozen yards from it. My eyes had become dim. "Lie down!" screamed
despair; "lie down!"
I touched it, and halted. "Too late!" screamed despair; "lie down!"
I fought stiffly with it. I was on the manhole lip, a stupefied, half-dead
being. The snow was all about me. I pulled myself in. There lurked within
a little warmer air.
The snowflakes--the airflakes--danced in about me, as I tried with
chilling hands to thrust the valve in and spun it tight and hard. I
sobbed. "I will," I chattered in my teeth. And then, with fingers that
quivered and felt brittle, I turned to the shutter studs.
As I fumbled with the switches--for I had never controlled them before--I
could see dimly through the steaming glass the blazing red streamers of
the sinking sun, dancing and flickering through the snowstorm, and the
black forms of the scrub thickening and bending and breaking beneath the
accumulating snow. Thicker whirled the snow and thicker, black against
the light. What if even now the switches overcame me? Then something
clicked under my hands, and in an instant that last vision of the moon
world was hidden from my eyes. I was in the silence and darkness of the
inter-planetary sphere.
Chapter 20
Mr. Bedford in Infinite Space
It was almost as though I had been killed. Indeed, I could imagine a man
suddenly and violently killed would feel very much as I did. One moment, a
passion of agonising existence and fear; the next darkness and stillness,
neither light nor life nor sun, moon nor stars, the blank infinite.
Although the thing was done by my own act, although I had already tasted
this very of effect in Cavor's company, I felt astonished, dumbfounded,
and overwhelmed. I seemed to be borne upward into an enormous darkness. My
fingers floated off the studs, I hung as if I were annihilated, and at
last very softly and gently I came against the bale and the golden chain,
and the crowbars that had drifted to the middle of the sphere.
I do not know how long that drifting took. In the sphere of course, even
more than on the moon, one's earthly time sense was ineffectual. At the
touch of the bale it was as if I had awakened from a dreamless sleep. I
immediately perceived that if I wanted to keep awake and alive I must get
a light or open a window, so as to get a grip of something with my eyes.
And besides, I was cold. I kicked off from the bale, therefore, clawed on
to the thin cords within the glass, crawled along until I got to the
manhole rim, and so got my bearings for the light and blind studs, took a
shove off, and flying once round the bale, and getting a scare from
something big and flimsy that was drifting loose, I got my hand on the
cord quite close to the studs, and reached them. I lit the little lamp
first of all to see what it was I had collided with, and discovered that
old copy of _Lloyd's News_ had slipped its moorings, and was adrift in
the void. That brought me out of the infinite to my own proper dimensions
again. It made me laugh and pant for a time, and suggested the idea of a
little oxygen from one of the cylinders. After that I lit the heater until
I felt warm, and then I took food. Then I set to work in a very gingerly
fashion on the Cavorite blinds, to see if I could guess by any means how
the sphere was travelling.
The first blind I opened I shut at once, and hung for a time flattened and
blinded by the sunlight that had hit me. After thinking a little I started
upon the windows at right angles to this one, and got the huge crescent
moon and the little crescent earth behind it, the second time. I was
amazed to find how far I was from the moon. I had reckoned that not only
should I have little or none of the "kick-off" that the earth's atmosphere
had given us at our start, but that the tangential "fly off" of the moon's
spin would be at least twenty-eight times less than the earth's. I had
expected to discover myself hanging over our crater, and on the edge of
the night, but all that was now only a part of the outline of the white
crescent that filled the sky. And Cavor--?
He was already infinitesimal.
I tried to imagine what could have happened to him. But at that time I
could think of nothing but death. I seemed to see him, bent and smashed
at the foot of some interminably high cascade of blue. And all about him
the stupid insects stared...
Under the inspiring touch of the drifting newspaper I became practical
again for a while. It was quite clear to me that what I had to do was to
get back to earth, but as far as I could see I was drifting away from it.
Whatever had happened to Cavor, even if he was still alive, which seemed
to me incredible after that blood-stained scrap, I was powerless to help
him. There he was, living or dead behind the mantle of that rayless night,
and there he must remain at least until I could summon our fellow men to
his assistance. Should I do that? Something of the sort I had in my mind;
to come back to earth if it were possible, and then as maturer
consideration might determine, either to show and explain the sphere to a
few discreet persons, and act with them, or else to keep my secret, sell
my gold, obtain weapons, provisions, and an assistant, and return with
these advantages to deal on equal terms with the flimsy people of the
moon, to rescue Cavor, if that were still possible, and at any rate to
procure a sufficient supply of gold to place my subsequent proceedings on
a firmer basis. But that was hoping far; I had first to get back.
I set myself to decide just exactly how the return to earth could be
contrived. As I struggled with that problem I ceased to worry about what I
should do when I got there. At last my only care was to get back.
I puzzled out at last that my best chance would be to drop back towards
the moon as near as I dared in order to gather velocity, then to shut my
windows, and fly behind it, and when I was past to open my earthward
windows, and so get off at a good pace homeward. But whether I should ever
reach the earth by that device, or whether I might not simply find myself
spinning about it in some hyperbolic or parabolic curve or other, I could
not tell. Later I had a happy inspiration, and by opening certain windows
to the moon, which had appeared in the sky in front of the earth, I turned
my course aside so as to head off the earth, which it had become evident
to me I must pass behind without some such expedient. I did a very great
deal of complicated thinking over these problems--for I am no
mathematician--and in the end I am certain it was much more my good luck
than my reasoning that enabled me to hit the earth. Had I known then, as I
know now, the mathematical chances there were against me, I doubt if I
should have troubled even to touch the studs to make any attempt. And
having puzzled out what I considered to be the thing to do, I opened all
my moonward windows, and squatted down--the effort lifted me for a time
some feet or so into the air, and I hung there in the oddest way--and
waited for the crescent to get bigger and bigger until I felt I was near
enough for safety. Then I would shut the windows, fly past the moon with
the velocity I had got from it--if I did not smash upon it--and so go on
towards the earth.
And that is what I did.
At last I felt my moonward start was sufficient. I shut out the sight of
the moon from my eyes, and in a state of mind that was, I now recall,
incredibly free from anxiety or any distressful quality, I sat down to
begin a vigil in that little speck of matter in infinite space that would
last until I should strike the earth. The heater had made the sphere
tolerably warm, the air had been refreshed by the oxygen, and except for
that faint congestion of the head that was always with me while I was away
from earth, I felt entire physical comfort. I had extinguished the light
again, lest it should fail me in the end; I was in darkness, save for the
earthshine and the glitter of the stars below me. Everything was so
absolutely silent and still that I might indeed have been the only being
in the universe, and yet, strangely enough, I had no more feeling of
loneliness or fear than if I had been lying in bed on earth. Now, this
seems all the stranger to me, since during my last hours in that crater of
the moon, the sense of my utter loneliness had been an agony....
Incredible as it will seem, this interval of time that I spent in space
has no sort of proportion to any other interval of time in my life.
Sometimes it seemed as though I sat through immeasurable eternities like
some god upon a lotus leaf, and again as though there was a momentary
pause as I leapt from moon to earth. In truth, it was altogether some
weeks of earthly time. But I had done with care and anxiety, hunger or
fear, for that space. I floated, thinking with a strange breadth and
freedom of all that we had undergone, and of all my life and motives, and
the secret issues of my being. I seemed to myself to have grown greater
and greater, to have lost all sense of movement; to be floating amidst the
stars, and always the sense of earth's littleness and the infinite
littleness of my life upon it, was implicit in my thoughts.
I can't profess to explain the things that happened in my mind. No doubt
they could all be traced directly or indirectly to the curious physical
conditions under which I was living. I set them down here just for what
they are worth, and without any comment. The most prominent quality of it
was a pervading doubt of my own identity. I became, if I may so express
it, dissociate from Bedford; I looked down on Bedford as a trivial,
incidental thing with which I chanced to be connected. I saw Bedford in
many relations--as an ass or as a poor beast, where I had hitherto been
inclined to regard him with a quiet pride as a very spirited or rather
forcible person. I saw him not only as an ass, but as the son of many
generations of asses. I reviewed his school-days and his early manhood,
and his first encounter with love, very much as one might review the
proceedings of an ant in the sand. Something of that period of lucidity I
regret still hangs about me, and I doubt if I shall ever recover the
full-bodied self satisfaction of my early days. But at the time the thing
was not in the least painful, because I had that extraordinary persuasion
that, as a matter of fact, I was no more Bedford than I was any one else,
but only a mind floating in the still serenity of space. Why should I be
disturbed about this Bedford's shortcomings? I was not responsible for him
or them.
For a time I struggled against this really very grotesque delusion. I
tried to summon the memory of vivid moments, of tender or intense emotions
to my assistance; I felt that if I could recall one genuine twinge of
feeling the growing severance would be stopped. But I could not do it. I
saw Bedford rushing down Chancery Lane, hat on the back of his head, coat
tails flying out, en route for his public examination. I saw him dodging
and bumping against, and even saluting, other similar little creatures in
that swarming gutter of people. Me? I saw Bedford that same evening in the
sitting-room of a certain lady, and his hat was on the table beside him,
and it wanted brushing badly, and he was in tears. Me? I saw him with
that lady in various attitudes and emotions--I never felt so detached
before.... I saw him hurrying off to Lympne to write a play, and accosting
Cavor, and in his shirt sleeves working at the sphere, and walking out to
Canterbury because he was afraid to come! Me? I did not believe it.
I still reasoned that all this was hallucination due to my solitude, and
the fact that I had lost all weight and sense of resistance. I endeavoured
to recover that sense by banging myself about the sphere, by pinching my
hands and clasping them together. Among other things, I lit the light,
captured that torn copy of _Lloyd's_, and read those convincingly realistic
advertisements about the Cutaway bicycle, and the gentleman of private
means, and the lady in distress who was selling those "forks and spoons."
There was no doubt _they_ existed surely enough, and, said I, "This is
your world, and you are Bedford, and you are going back to live among
things like that for all the rest of your life." But the doubts within
me could still argue: "It is not you that is reading, it is Bedford, but
you are not Bedford, you know. That's just where the mistake comes in."
"Confound it!" I cried; "and if I am not Bedford, what am I?"
But in that direction no light was forthcoming, though the strangest
fancies came drifting into my brain, queer remote suspicions, like shadows
seen from away. Do you know, I had a sort of idea that really I was
something quite outside not only the world, but all worlds, and out of
space and time, and that this poor Bedford was just a peephole through
which I looked at life? ...
Bedford! However I disavowed him, there I was most certainly bound up with
him, and I knew that wherever or whatever I might be, I must needs feel
the stress of his desires, and sympathise with all his joys and sorrows
until his life should end. And with the dying of Bedford--what then? ...
Enough of this remarkable phase of my experiences! I tell it here simply
to show how one's isolation and departure from this planet touched not
only the functions and feeling of every organ of the body, but indeed also
the very fabric of the mind, with strange and unanticipated disturbances.
All through the major portion of that vast space journey I hung thinking
of such immaterial things as these, hung dissociated and apathetic, a
cloudy megalomaniac, as it were, amidst the stars and planets in the void
of space; and not only the world to which I was returning, but the
blue-lit caverns of the Selenites, their helmet faces, their gigantic and
wonderful machines, and the fate of Cavor, dragged helpless into that
world, seemed infinitely minute and altogether trivial things to me.
Until at last I began to feel the pull of the earth upon my being, drawing
me back again to the life that is real for men. And then, indeed, it grew
clearer and clearer to me that I was quite certainly Bedford after all,
and returning after amazing adventures to this world of ours, and with a
life that I was very likely to lose in this return. I set myself to puzzle
out the conditions under which I must fall to earth.
Chapter 21
Mr. Bedford at Littlestone
My line of flight was about parallel with the surface as I came into the
upper air. The temperature of sphere began to rise forthwith. I knew it
behoved me to drop at once. Far below me, in a darkling twilight, stretched
a great expanse of sea. I opened every window I could, and fell--out
of sunshine into evening, and out of evening into night. Vaster grew
the earth and vaster, swallowing up the stars, and the silvery translucent
starlit veil of cloud it wore spread out to catch me. At last the world
seemed no longer a sphere but flat, and then concave. It was no longer a
planet in the sky, but the world of Man. I shut all but an inch or so of
earthward window, and dropped with a slackening velocity. The broadening
water, now so near that I could see the dark glitter of the waves, rushed
up to meet me. The sphere became very hot. I snapped the last strip of
window, and sat scowling and biting my knuckles, waiting for the impact....
The sphere hit the water with a huge splash: it must have sent it fathoms
high. At the splash I flung the Cavorite shutters open. Down I went, but
slower and slower, and then I felt the sphere pressing against my feet,
and so drove up again as a bubble drives. And at the last I was floating
and rocking upon the surface of the sea, and my journey in space was at an
end.
The night was dark and overcast. Two yellow pinpoints far away showed the
passing of a ship, and nearer was a red glare that came and went. Had not
the electricity of my glow-lamp exhausted itself, I could have got picked
up that night. In spite of the inordinate fatigue I was beginning to feel,
I was excited now, and for a time hopeful, in a feverish, impatient way,
that so my travelling might end.
But at last I ceased to move about, and sat, wrists on knees, staring at a
distant red light. It swayed up and down, rocking, rocking. My excitement
passed. I realised I had yet to spend another night at least in the
sphere. I perceived myself infinitely heavy and fatigued. And so I fell
asleep.
A change in my rhythmic motion awakened me. I peered through the
refracting glass, and saw that I had come aground upon a huge shallow of
sand. Far away I seemed to see houses and trees, and seaward a curve,
vague distortion of a ship hung between sea and sky.
I stood up and staggered. My one desire was to emerge. The manhole was
upward, and I wrestled with the screw. Slowly I opened the manhole. At
last the air was singing in again as once it had sung out. But this time
I did not wait until the pressure was adjusted. In another moment I had
the weight of the window on my hands, and I was open, wide open, to the
old familiar sky of earth.
The air hit me on the chest so that I gasped. I dropped the glass screw. I
cried out, put my hands to my chest, and sat down. For a time I was in
pain. Then I took deep breaths. At last I could rise and move about
again.
I tried to thrust my head through the manhole, and the sphere rolled over.
It was as though something had lugged my head down directly it emerged. I
ducked back sharply, or I should have been pinned face under water. After
some wriggling and shoving I managed to crawl out upon sand, over which
the retreating waves still came and went.
I did not attempt to stand up. It seemed to me that my body must be
suddenly changed to lead. Mother Earth had her grip on me now--no
Cavorite intervening. I sat down heedless of the water that came over my
feet.
It was dawn, a gray dawn, rather overcast but showing here and there a
long patch of greenish gray. Some way out a ship was lying at anchor, a
pale silhouette of a ship with one yellow light. The water came rippling
in in long shallow waves. Away to the right curved the land, a shingle
bank with little hovels, and at last a lighthouse, a sailing mark and a
point. Inland stretched a space of level sand, broken here and there by
pools of water, and ending a mile away perhaps in a low shore of scrub. To
the north-east some isolated watering-place was visible, a row of gaunt
lodging-houses, the tallest things that I could see on earth, dull dabs
against the brightening sky. What strange men can have reared these
vertical piles in such an amplitude of space I do not know. There they
are, like pieces of Brighton lost in the waste.
For a long time I sat there, yawning and rubbing my face. At last I
struggled to rise. It made me feel that I was lifting a weight. I stood
up.
I stared at the distant houses. For the first time since our starvation in
the crater I thought of earthly food. "Bacon," I whispered, "eggs. Good
toast and good coffee.... And how the devil am I going to get all this
stuff to Lympne?" I wondered where I was. It was an east shore anyhow,
and I had seen Europe before I dropped.
I heard footsteps crunching in the sand, and a little round-faced,
friendly-looking man in flannels, with a bathing towel wrapped about his
shoulders, and his bathing dress over his arm, appeared up the beach. I
knew instantly that I must be in England. He was staring most intently at
the sphere and me. He advanced staring. I dare say I looked a ferocious
savage enough--dirty, unkempt, to an indescribable degree; but it did not
occur to me at the time. He stopped at a distance of twenty yards.
"Hul-lo, my man!" he said doubtfully.
"Hullo yourself!" said I.
He advanced, reassured by that. "What on earth is that thing?" he asked.
"Can you tell me where I am?" I asked.
"That's Littlestone," he said, pointing to the houses; "and that's
Dungeness! Have you just landed? What's that thing you've got? Some sort
of machine?"
"Yes."
"Have you floated ashore? Have you been wrecked or something? What is it?"
I meditated swiftly. I made an estimate of the little man's appearance as
he drew nearer. "By Jove!" he said, "you've had a time of it! I thought
you-- Well-- Where were you cast away? Is that thing a sort of floating
thing for saving life?"
I decided to take that line for the present. I made a few vague
affirmatives. "I want help," I said hoarsely. "I want to get some stuff
up the beach--stuff I can't very well leave about." I became aware of
three other pleasant-looking young men with towels, blazers, and straw
hats, coming down the sands towards me. Evidently the early bathing
section of this Littlestone.
"Help!" said the young man: "rather!" He became vaguely active. "What
particularly do you want done?" He turned round and gesticulated. The
three young men accelerated their pace. In a minute they there about me,
plying me with questions I was indisposed to answer. "I'll tell all that
later," I said. "I'm dead beat. I'm a rag."
"Come up to the hotel," said the foremost little man. "We'll look after
that thing there."
I hesitated. "I can't," I said. "In that sphere there's two big bars of
gold."
They looked incredulously at one another, then at me with a new inquiry.
I went to the sphere, stooped, crept in, and presently they had the
Selenites' crowbars and the broken chain before them. If I had not been so
horribly fagged I could have laughed at them. It was like kittens round a
beetle. They didn't know what to do with the stuff. The fat little man
stooped and lifted the end of one of the bars, and then dropped it with a
grunt. Then they all did.
"It's lead, or gold!" said one.
"Oh, it's gold!" said another.
"Gold, right enough," said the third.
Then they all stared at me, and then they all stared at the ship lying at
anchor.
"I say!" cried the little man. "But where did you get that?"
I was too tired to keep up a lie. "I got it in the moon."
I saw them stare at one another.
"Look here!" said I, "I'm not going to argue now. Help me carry these
lumps of gold up to the hotel--I guess, with rests, two of you can manage
one, and I'll trail this chain thing--and I'll tell you more when I've
had some food."
"And how about that thing?"
"It won't hurt there," I said. "Anyhow--confound it!--it must stop there
now. If the tide comes up, it will float all right."
And in a state of enormous wonderment, these young men most obediently
hoisted my treasures on their shoulders, and with limbs that felt like
lead I headed a sort of procession towards that distant fragment of
"sea-front." Half-way there we were reinforced by two awe-stricken little
girls with spades, and later a lean little boy, with a penetrating sniff,
appeared. He was, I remember, wheeling a bicycle, and he accompanied us at
a distance of about a hundred yards on our right flank, and then I
suppose, gave us up as uninteresting, mounted his bicycle and rode off
over the level sands in the direction of the sphere.
I glanced back after him.
"He won't touch it," said the stout young man reassuringly, and I was only
too willing to be reassured.
At first something of the gray of the morning was in my mind, but
presently the sun disengaged itself from the level clouds of the horizon
and lit the world, and turned the leaden sea to glittering waters. My
spirits rose. A sense of the vast importance of the things I had done and
had yet to do came with the sunlight into my mind. I laughed aloud as the
foremost man staggered under my gold. When indeed I took my place in the
world, how amazed the world would be!
If it had not been for my inordinate fatigue, the landlord of the
Littlestone hotel would have been amusing, as he hesitated between my gold
and my respectable company on the one and my filthy appearance on the
other. But at last I found myself in a terrestrial bathroom once more with
warm water to wash myself with, and a change of raiment, preposterously
small indeed, but anyhow clean, that the genial little man had lent me. He
lent me a razor too, but I could not screw up my resolution to attack even
the outposts of the bristling beard that covered my face.
I sat down to an English breakfast and ate with a sort of languid
appetite--an appetite many weeks old and very decrepit--and stirred myself
to answer the questions of the four young men. And I told them the truth.
"Well," said I, "as you press me--I got it in the moon."
"The moon?"
"Yes, the moon in the sky."
"But how do you mean?"
"What I say, confound it!"
"Then you have just come from the moon?"
"Exactly! through space--in that ball." And I took a delicious mouthful
of egg. I made a private note that when I went back to the moon I would
take a box of eggs.
I could see clearly that they did not believe one word what I told them,
but evidently they considered me the most respectable liar they had ever
met. They glanced at one another, and then concentrated the fire of their
eyes on me. I fancy they expected a clue to me in the way I helped myself
to salt. They seemed to find something significant in my peppering my egg.
These strangely shaped masses of gold they had staggered under held their
minds. There the lumps lay in front of me, each worth thousands of pounds,
and as impossible for any one to steal as a house or a piece of land. As I
looked at their curious faces over my coffee-cup, I realised something of
the enormous wilderness of explanations into which I should have to wander
to render myself comprehensible again.
"You don't really mean--" began the youngest young man, in the tone of one
who speaks to an obstinate child.
"Just pass me that toast-rack," I said, and shut him up completely.
"But look here, I say," began one of the others. "We're not going to
believe that, you know."
"Ah, well," said I, and shrugged my shoulders.
"He doesn't want to tell us," said the youngest young man in a stage
aside; and then, with an appearance of great sang-froid, "You don't mind
if I take a cigarette?"
I waved him a cordial assent, and proceeded with my breakfast. Two of the
others went and looked out of the farther window and talked inaudibly. I
was struck by a thought. "The tide," I said, "is running out?"
There was a pause, a doubt who should answer me.
"It's near the ebb," said the fat little man.
"Well, anyhow," I said, "it won't float far."
I decapitated my third egg, and began a little speech. "Look here," I
said. "Please don't imagine I'm surly or telling you uncivil lies, or
anything of that sort. I'm forced almost, to be a little short and
mysterious. I can quite understand this is as queer as it can be, and
that your imaginations must be going it. I can assure you, you're in at a
memorable time. But I can't make it clear to you now--it's impossible. I
give you my word of honour I've come from the moon, and that's all I can
tell you.... All the same, I'm tremendously obliged to you, you know,
tremendously. I hope that my manner hasn't in any way given you offence."
"Oh, not in the least!" said the youngest young man affably. "We can quite
understand," and staring hard at me all the time, he heeled his chair back
until it very nearly upset, and recovered with some exertion. "Not a bit
of it," said the fat young man.
"Don't you imagine that!" and they all got up and dispersed, and walked
about and lit cigarettes, and generally tried to show they were perfectly
amiable and disengaged, and entirely free from the slightest curiosity
about me and the sphere. "I'm going to keep an eye on that ship out there
all the same," I heard one of them remarking in an undertone. If only they
could have forced themselves to it, they would, I believe, even have gone
out and left me. I went on with my third egg.
"The weather," the fat little man remarked presently, "has been immense,
has it not? I don't know when we have had such a summer."
Phoo-whizz! Like a tremendous rocket!
And somewhere a window was broken....
"What's that?" said I.
"It isn't--?" cried the little man, and rushed to the corner window.
All the others rushed to the window likewise. I sat staring at them.
Suddenly I leapt up, knocked over my third egg, rushed for the window
also. I had just thought of something. "Nothing to be seen there," cried
the little man, rushing for the door.
"It's that boy!" I cried, bawling in hoarse fury; "it's that accursed
boy!" and turning about I pushed the waiter aside--he was just bring me
some more toast--and rushed violently out of the room and down and out
upon the queer little esplanade in front of the hotel.
The sea, which had been smooth, was rough now with hurrying cat's-paws,
and all about where the sphere had been was tumbled water like the wake of
a ship. Above, a little puff of cloud whirled like dispersing smoke, and
the three or four people on the beach were staring up with interrogative
faces towards the point of that unexpected report. And that was all! Boots
and waiter and the four young men in blazers came rushing out behind me.
Shouts came from windows and doors, and all sorts of worrying people came
into sight--agape.
For a time I stood there, too overwhelmed by this new development to think
of the people.
At first I was too stunned to see the thing as any definite disaster--I
was just stunned, as a man is by some accidental violent blow. It is only
afterwards he begins to appreciate his specific injury.
"Good Lord!"
I felt as though somebody was pouring funk out of a can down the back of
my neck. My legs became feeble. I had got the first intimation of what the
disaster meant for me. There was that confounded boy--sky high! I was
utterly left. There was the gold in the coffee-room--my only possession
on earth. How would it all work out? The general effect was of a gigantic
unmanageable confusion.
"I say," said the voice of the little man behind. "I say, you know."
I wheeled about, and there were twenty or thirty people, a sort of
irregular investment of people, all bombarding me with dumb interrogation,
with infinite doubt and suspicion. I felt the compulsion of their eyes
intolerably. I groaned aloud.
"I _can't_," I shouted. "I tell you I can't! I'm not equal to it! You must
puzzle and--and be damned to you!"
I gesticulated convulsively. He receded a step as though I had threatened
him. I made a bolt through them into the hotel. I charged back into the
coffee-room, rang the bell furiously. I gripped the waiter as he entered.
"D'ye hear?" I shouted. "Get help and carry these bars up to my room right
away."
He failed to understand me, and I shouted and raved at him. A
scared-looking little old man in a green apron appeared, and further two
of the young men in flannels. I made a dash at them and commandeered their
services. As soon as the gold was in my room I felt free to quarrel. "Now
get out," I shouted; "all of you get out if you don't want to see a man go
mad before your eyes!" And I helped the waiter by the shoulder as he
hesitated in the doorway. And then, as soon as I had the door locked on
them all, I tore off the little man's clothes again, shied them right and
left, and got into bed forthwith. And there I lay swearing and panting and
cooling for a very long time.
At last I was calm enough to get out of bed and ring up the round-eyed
waiter for a flannel nightshirt, a soda and whisky, and some good cigars.
And these things being procured me, after an exasperating delay that drove
me several times to the bell, I locked the door again and proceeded very
deliberately to look the entire situation in the face.
The net result of the great experiment presented itself as an absolute
failure. It was a rout, and I was the sole survivor. It was an absolute
collapse, and this was the final disaster. There was nothing for it but to
save myself, and as much as I could in the way of prospects from our
debacle. At one fatal crowning blow all my vague resolutions of return and
recovery had vanished. My intention of going back to the moon, of getting
a sphereful of gold, and afterwards of having a fragment of Cavorite
analysed and so recovering the great secret--perhaps, finally, even of
recovering Cavor's body--all these ideas vanished altogether.
I was the sole survivor, and that was all.
I think that going to bed was one of the luckiest ideas I have ever had in
an emergency. I really believe I should either have got loose-headed or
done some indiscreet thing. But there, locked in and secure from all
interruptions, I could think out the position in all its bearings and make
my arrangements at leisure.
Of course, it was quite clear to me what had happened to the boy. He had
crawled into the sphere, meddled with the studs, shut the Cavorite
windows, and gone up. It was highly improbable he had screwed the manhole
stopper, and, even if he had, the chances were a thousand to one against
his getting back. It was fairly evident that he would gravitate with my
bales to somewhere near the middle of the sphere and remain there, and so
cease to be a legitimate terrestrial interest, however remarkable he might
seem to the inhabitants of some remote quarter of space. I very speedily
convinced myself on that point. And as for any responsibility I might have
in the matter, the more I reflected upon that, the clearer it became that
if only I kept quiet about things, I need not trouble myself about that.
If I was faced by sorrowing parents demanding their lost boy, I had merely
to demand my lost sphere--or ask them what they meant. At first I had had
a vision of weeping parents and guardians, and all sorts of complications;
but now I saw that I simply had to keep my mouth shut, and nothing in that
way could arise. And, indeed, the more I lay and smoked and thought, the
more evident became the wisdom of impenetrability.
It is within the right of every British citizen, provided he does not
commit damage nor indecorum, to appear suddenly wherever he pleases, and
as ragged and filthy as he pleases, and with whatever amount of virgin
gold he sees fit to encumber himself, and no one has any right at all to
hinder and detain him in this procedure. I formulated that at last to
myself, and repeated it over as a sort of private Magna Charta of my
liberty.
Once I had put that issue on one side, I could take up and consider in an
equable manner certain considerations I had scarcely dared to think of
before, namely, those arising out of the circumstances of my bankruptcy.
But now, looking at this matter calmly and at leisure, I could see that if
only I suppressed my identity by a temporary assumption of some less
well-known name, and if I retained the two months' beard that had grown
upon me, the risks of any annoyance from the spiteful creditor to whom I
have already alluded became very small indeed. From that to a definite
course of rational worldly action was plain sailing. It was all amazingly
petty, no doubt, but what was there remaining for me to do?
Whatever I did I was resolved that I would keep myself level and right
side up.
I ordered up writing materials, and addressed a letter to the New Romney
Bank--the nearest, the waiter informed me--telling the manager I wished
to open an account with him, and requesting him to send two trustworthy
persons properly authenticated in a cab with a good horse to fetch some
hundredweight of gold with which I happened to be encumbered. I signed the
letter "Blake," which seemed to me to be a thoroughly respectable sort of
name. This done, I got a Folkstone Blue Book, picked out an outfitter, and
asked him to send a cutter to measure me for a dark tweed suit, ordering
at the same time a valise, dressing bag, brown boots, shirts, hat (to
fit), and so forth; and from a watchmaker I also ordered a watch. And
these letters being despatched, I had up as good a lunch as the hotel
could give, and then lay smoking a cigar, as calm and ordinary as
possible, until in accordance with my instructions two duly authenticated
clerks came from the bank and weighed and took away my gold. After which I
pulled the clothes over my ears in order to drown any knocking, and went
very comfortably to sleep.
I went to sleep. No doubt it was a prosaic thing for the first man back
from the moon to do, and I can imagine that the young and imaginative
reader will find my behaviour disappointing. But I was horribly fatigued
and bothered, and, confound it! what else was there to do? There certainly
was not the remotest chance of my being believed, if I had told my story
then, and it would certainly have subjected me to intolerable annoyances.
I went to sleep. When at last I woke up again I was ready to face the
world as I have always been accustomed to face it since I came to years of
discretion. And so I got away to Italy, and there it is I am writing this
story. If the world will not have it as fact, then the world may take it
as fiction. It is no concern of mine.
And now that the account is finished, I am amazed to think how completely
this adventure is gone and done with. Everybody believes that Cavor was a
not very brilliant scientific experimenter who blew up his house and
himself at Lympne, and they explain the bang that followed my arrival at
Littlestone by a reference to the experiments with explosives that are
going on continually at the government establishment of Lydd, two miles
away. I must confess that hitherto I have not acknowledged my share in the
disappearance of Master Tommy Simmons, which was that little boy's name.
That, perhaps, may prove a difficult item of corroboration to explain
away. They account for my appearance in rags with two bars of indisputable
gold upon the Littlestone beach in various ingenious ways--it doesn't
worry me what they think of me. They say I have strung all these things
together to avoid being questioned too closely as to the source of my
wealth. I would like to see the man who could invent a story that would
hold together like this one. Well, they must take it as fiction--there it
is.
I have told my story--and now, I suppose, I have to take up the worries
of this terrestrial life again. Even if one has been to the moon, one has
still to earn a living. So I am working here at Amalfi, on the scenario of
that play I sketched before Cavor came walking into my world, and I am
trying to piece my life together as it was before ever I saw him. I must
confess that I find it hard to keep my mind on the play when the moonshine
comes into my room. It is full moon here, and last night I was out on the
pergola for hours, staring away at the shining blankness that hides so
much. Imagine it! tables and chairs, and trestles and bars of gold!
Confound it!--if only one could hit on that Cavorite again! But a thing
like that doesn't come twice in a life. Here I am, a little better off
than I was at Lympne, and that is all. And Cavor has committed suicide in
a more elaborate way than any human being ever did before. So the story
closes as finally and completely as a dream. It fits in so little with
all the other things of life, so much of it is so utterly remote from all
human experience, the leaping, the eating, the breathing, and these
weightless times, that indeed there are moments when, in spite of my
moon gold, I do more than half believe myself that the whole thing was
a dream....
Chapter 22
The Astonishing Communication of Mr. Julius Wendigee
When I had finished my account of my return to the earth at Littlestone, I
wrote, "The End," made a flourish, and threw my pen aside, fully believing
that the whole story of the First Men in the Moon was done. Not only had I
done this, but I had placed my manuscript in the hands of a literary
agent, had permitted it to be sold, had seen the greater portion of it
appear in the _Strand Magazine_, and was setting to work again upon the
scenario of the play I had commenced at Lympne before I realised that the
end was not yet. And then, following me from Amalfi to Algiers, there
reached me (it is now about six months ago) one of the most astounding
communications I have ever been fated to receive. Briefly, it informed me
that Mr. Julius Wendigee, a Dutch electrician, who has been experimenting
with certain apparatus akin to the apparatus used by Mr. Tesla in America,
in the hope of discovering some method of communication with Mars, was
receiving day by day a curiously fragmentary message in English, which was
indisputably emanating from Mr. Cavor in the moon.
At first I thought the thing was an elaborate practical joke by some one
who had seen the manuscript of my narrative. I answered Mr. Wendigee
jestingly, but he replied in a manner that put such suspicion altogether
aside, and in a state of inconceivable excitement I hurried from Algiers
to the little observatory upon the Monte Rosa in which he was working. In
the presence of his record and his appliances--and above all of the
messages from Cavor that were coming to hand--my lingering doubts
vanished. I decided at once to accept a proposal he made to me to remain
with him, assisting him to take down the record from day to day, and
endeavouring with him to send a message back to the moon. Cavor, we
learnt, was not only alive, but free, in the midst of an almost
inconceivable community of these ant-like beings, these ant-men, in the
blue darkness of the lunar caves. He was lamed, it seemed, but otherwise
in quite good health--in better health, he distinctly said, than he
usually enjoyed on earth. He had had a fever, but it had left no bad
effects. But curiously enough he seemed to be labouring under a conviction
that I was either dead in the moon crater or lost in the deep of space.
His message began to be received by Mr. Wendigee when that gentleman was
engaged in quite a different investigation. The reader will no doubt
recall the little excitement that began the century, arising out of an
announcement by Mr. Nikola Tesla, the American electrical celebrity, that
he had received a message from Mars. His announcement renewed attention to
fact that had long been familiar to scientific people, namely: that from
some unknown source in space, waves of electromagnetic disturbance,
entirely similar those used by Signor Marconi for his wireless telegraphy,
are constantly reaching the earth. Besides Tesla quite a number of other
observers have been engaged in perfecting apparatus for receiving and
recording these vibrations, though few would go so far to consider them
actual messages from some extraterrestrial sender. Among that few,
however, we must certainly count Mr. Wendigee. Ever since 1898 he had
devoted himself almost entirely to this subject, and being a man of ample
means he had erected an observatory on the flanks of Monte Rosa, in a
position singularly adapted in every way for such observations.
My scientific attainments, I must admit, are not great, but so far as they
enable me to judge, Mr. Wendigee's contrivances for detecting and
recording any disturbances in the electromagnetic conditions of space are
singularly original and ingenious. And by a happy combination of
circumstances they were set up and in operation about two months before
Cavor made his first attempt to call up the earth. Consequently we have
fragments of his communication even from the beginning. Unhappily, they
are only fragments, and the most momentous of all the things that he had
to tell humanity--the instructions, that is, for the making of Cavorite,
if, indeed, he ever transmitted them--have throbbed themselves away
unrecorded into space. We never succeeded in getting a response back to
Cavor. He was unable to tell, therefore, what we had received or what we
had missed; nor, indeed, did he certainly know that any one on earth was
really aware of his efforts to reach us. And the persistence he displayed
in sending eighteen long descriptions of lunar affairs--as they would be
if we had them complete--shows how much his mind must have turned back
towards his native planet since he left it two years ago.
You can imagine how amazed Mr. Wendigee must have been when he discovered
his record of electromagnetic disturbances interlaced by Cavor's
straightforward English. Mr. Wendigee knew nothing of our wild journey
moonward, and suddenly--this English out of the void!
It is well the reader should understand the conditions under which it
would seem these messages were sent. Somewhere within the moon Cavor
certainly had access for a time to a considerable amount of electrical
apparatus, and it would seem he rigged up--perhaps furtively--a
transmitting arrangement of the Marconi type. This he was able to operate
at irregular intervals: sometimes for only half an hour or so, sometimes
for three or four hours at a stretch. At these times he transmitted his
earthward message, regardless of the fact that the relative position of
the moon and points upon the earth's surface is constantly altering. As a
consequence of this and of the necessary imperfections of our recording
instruments his communication comes and goes in our records in an
extremely fitful manner; it becomes blurred; it "fades out" in a
mysterious and altogether exasperating way. And added to this is the fact
that he was not an expert operator; he had partly forgotten, or never
completely mastered, the code in general use, and as he became fatigued he
dropped words and misspelt in a curious manner.
Altogether we have probably lost quite half of the communications he made,
and much we have is damaged, broken, and partly effaced. In the abstract
that follows the reader must be prepared therefore for a considerable
amount of break, hiatus, and change of topic. Mr. Wendigee and I are
collaborating in a complete and annotated edition of the Cavor record,
which we hope to publish, together with a detailed account of the
instruments employed, beginning with the first volume in January next.
That will be the full and scientific report, of which this is only the
popular transcript. But here we give at least sufficient to complete the
story I have told, and to give the broad outlines of the state of that
other world so near, so akin, and yet so dissimilar to our own.
Chapter 23
An Abstract of the Six Messages First Received from Mr. Cavor
The two earlier messages of Mr. Cavor may very well be reserved for that
larger volume. They simply tell, with greater brevity and with a
difference in several details that is interesting, but not of any vital
importance, the bare facts of the making of the sphere and our departure
from the world. Throughout, Cavor speaks of me as a man who is dead, but
with a curious change of temper as he approaches our landing on the moon.
"Poor Bedford," he says of me, and "this poor young man," and he blames
himself for inducing a young man, "by no means well equipped for such
adventures," to leave a planet "on which he was indisputably fitted to
succeed" on so precarious a mission. I think he underrates the part my
energy and practical capacity played in bringing about the realisation of
his theoretical sphere. "We arrived," he says, with no more account of our
passage through space than if we had made a journey of common occurrence
in a railway train.
And then he becomes increasingly unfair to me. Unfair, indeed, to an
extent I should not have expected in a man trained in the search for
truth. Looking back over my previously written account of these things, I
must insist that I have been altogether juster to Cavor than he has been
to me. I have extenuated little and suppressed nothing. But his account
is:--
"It speedily became apparent that the entire strangeness of our
circumstances and surroundings--great loss of weight, attenuated but
highly oxygenated air, consequent exaggeration of the results of muscular
effort, rapid development of weird plants from obscure spores, lurid
sky--was exciting my companion unduly. On the moon his character seemed to
deteriorate. He became impulsive, rash, and quarrelsome. In a little while
his folly in devouring some gigantic vesicles and his consequent
intoxication led to our capture by the Selenites--before we had had the
slightest opportunity of properly observing their ways...."
(He says, you observe, nothing of his own concession to these same
"vesicles.")
And he goes on from that point to say that "We came to a difficult passage
with them, and Bedford mistaking certain gestures of theirs"--pretty
gestures they were!--"gave way to a panic violence. He ran amuck, killed
three, and perforce I had to flee with him after the outrage. Subsequently
we fought with a number who endeavoured to bar our way, and slew seven or
eight more. It says much for the tolerance of these beings that on my
recapture I was not instantly slain. We made our way to the exterior and
separated in the crater of our arrival, to increase our chances of
recovering our sphere. But presently I came upon a body of Selenites, led
by two who were curiously different, even in form, from any of these we
had seen hitherto, with larger heads and smaller bodies, and much more
elaborately wrapped about. And after evading them for some time I fell
into a crevasse, cut my head rather badly, and displaced my patella, and,
finding crawling very painful, decided to surrender--if they would still
permit me to do so. This they did, and, perceiving my helpless condition,
carried me with them again into the moon. And of Bedford I have heard or
seen nothing more, nor, so far as I can gather, any Selenite. Either the
night overtook him in the crater, or else, which is more probable, he
found the sphere, and, desiring to steal a march upon me, made off with
it--only, I fear, to find it uncontrollable, and to meet a more lingering
fate in outer space."
And with that Cavor dismisses me and goes on to more interesting topics. I
dislike the idea of seeming to use my position as his editor to deflect
his story in my own interest, but I am obliged to protest here against the
turn he gives these occurrences. He said nothing about that gasping
message on the blood-stained paper in which he told, or attempted to tell,
a very different story. The dignified self-surrender is an altogether new
view of the affair that has come to him, I must insist, since he began to
feel secure among the lunar people; and as for the "stealing a march"
conception, I am quite willing to let the reader decide between us on what
he has before him. I know I am not a model man--I have made no pretence
to be. But am I that?
However, that is the sum of my wrongs. From this point I can edit Cavor
with an untroubled mind, for he mentions me no more.
It would seem the Selenites who had come upon him carried him to some
point in the interior down "a great shaft" by means of what he describes
as "a sort of balloon." We gather from the rather confused passage in
which he describes this, and from a number of chance allusions and hints
in other and subsequent messages, that this "great shaft" is one of an
enormous system of artificial shafts that run, each from what is called a
lunar "crater," downwards for very nearly a hundred miles towards the
central portion of our satellite. These shafts communicate by transverse
tunnels, they throw out abysmal caverns and expand into great globular
places; the whole of the moon's substance for a hundred miles inward,
indeed, is a mere sponge of rock. "Partly," says Cavor, "this sponginess
is natural, but very largely it is due to the enormous industry of the
Selenites in the past. The enormous circular mounds of the excavated rock
and earth it is that form these great circles about the tunnels known to
earthly astronomers (misled by a false analogy) as volcanoes."
It was down this shaft they took him, in this "sort of balloon" he speaks
of, at first into an inky blackness and then into a region of continually
increasing phosphorescence. Cavor's despatches show him to be curiously
regardless of detail for a scientific man, but we gather that this light
was due to the streams and cascades of water--"no doubt containing some
phosphorescent organism"--that flowed ever more abundantly downward
towards the Central Sea. And as he descended, he says, "The Selenites also
became luminous." And at last far below him he saw, as it were, a lake of
heatless fire, the waters of the Central Sea, glowing and eddying in
strange perturbation, "like luminous blue milk that is just on the boil."
"This Lunar Sea," says Cavor, in a later passage "is not a stagnant ocean;
a solar tide sends it in a perpetual flow around the lunar axis, and
strange storms and boilings and rushings of its waters occur, and at times
cold winds and thunderings that ascend out of it into the busy ways of the
great ant-hill above. It is only when the water is in motion that it
gives out light; in its rare seasons of calm it is black. Commonly, when
one sees it, its waters rise and fall in an oily swell, and flakes and big
rafts of shining, bubbly foam drift with the sluggish, faintly glowing
current. The Selenites navigate its cavernous straits and lagoons in
little shallow boats of a canoe-like shape; and even before my journey to
the galleries about the Grand Lunar, who is Master of the Moon, I was
permitted to make a brief excursion on its waters.
"The caverns and passages are naturally very tortuous. A large proportion
of these ways are known only to expert pilots among the fishermen, and not
infrequently Selenites are lost for ever in their labyrinths. In their
remoter recesses, I am told, strange creatures lurk, some of them terrible
and dangerous creatures that all the science of the moon has been unable
to exterminate. There is particularly the Rapha, an inextricable mass of
clutching tentacles that one hacks to pieces only to multiply; and the
Tzee, a darting creature that is never seen, so subtly and suddenly does
it slay..."
He gives us a gleam of description.
"I was reminded on this excursion of what I have read of the Mammoth
Caves; if only I had had a yellow flambeau instead of the pervading blue
light, and a solid-looking boatman with an oar instead of a scuttle-faced
Selenite working an engine at the back of the canoe, I could have imagined
I had suddenly got back to earth. The rocks about us were very various,
sometimes black, sometimes pale blue and veined, and once they flashed and
glittered as though we had come into a mine of sapphires. And below one
saw the ghostly phosphorescent fishes flash and vanish in the hardly less
phosphorescent deep. Then, presently, a long ultra-marine vista down the
turgid stream of one of the channels of traffic, and a landing stage, and
then, perhaps, a glimpse up the enormous crowded shaft of one of the
vertical ways.
"In one great place heavy with glistening stalactites a number of boats
were fishing. We went alongside one of these and watched the long-armed
Selenites winding in a net. They were little, hunchbacked insects, with
very strong arms, short, bandy legs, and crinkled face-masks. As they
pulled at it that net seemed the heaviest thing I had come upon in the
moon; it was loaded with weights--no doubt of gold--and it took a long
time to draw, for in those waters the larger and more edible fish lurk
deep. The fish in the net came up like a blue moonrise--a blaze of
darting, tossing blue.
"Among their catch was a many-tentaculate, evil-eyed black thing,
ferociously active, whose appearance they greeted with shrieks and
twitters, and which with quick, nervous movements they hacked to pieces by
means of little hatchets. All its dissevered limbs continued to lash and
writhe in a vicious manner. Afterwards, when fever had hold of me, I
dreamt again and again of that bitter, furious creature rising so vigorous
and active out of the unknown sea. It was the most active and malignant
thing of all the living creatures I have yet seen in this world inside the
moon....
"The surface of this sea must be very nearly two hundred miles (if not
more) below the level of the moon's exterior; all the cities of the moon
lie, I learnt, immediately above this Central Sea, in such cavernous
spaces and artificial galleries as I have described, and they communicate
with the exterior by enormous vertical shafts which open invariably in
what are called by earthly astronomers the 'craters' of the moon. The lid
covering one such aperture I had already seen during the wanderings that
had preceded my capture.
"Upon the condition of the less central portion of the moon I have not yet
arrived at very precise knowledge. There is an enormous system of caverns
in which the mooncalves shelter during the night; and there are abattoirs
and the like--in one of these it was that I and Bedford fought with the
Selenite butchers--and I have since seen balloons laden with meat
descending out of the upper dark. I have as yet scarcely learnt as much of
these things as a Zulu in London would learn about the British corn
supplies in the same time. It is clear, however, that these vertical
shafts and the vegetation of the surface must play an essential role in
ventilating and keeping fresh the atmosphere of the moon. At one time, and
particularly on my first emergence from my prison, there was certainly a
cold wind blowing _down_ the shaft, and later there was a kind of sirocco
upward that corresponded with my fever. For at the end of about three
weeks I fell ill of an indefinable sort of fever, and in spite of sleep
and the quinine tabloids that very fortunately I had brought in my pocket,
I remained ill and fretting miserably, almost to the time when I was taken
into the presence of the Grand Lunar, who is Master of the Moon.
"I will not dilate on the wretchedness of my condition," he remarks,
"during those days of ill-health." And he goes on with great amplitude with
details I omit here. "My temperature," he concludes, "kept abnormally high
for a long time, and I lost all desire for food. I had stagnant waking
intervals, and sleep tormented by dreams, and at one phase I was, I
remember, so weak as to be earth-sick and almost hysterical. I longed
almost intolerably for colour to break the everlasting blue..."
He reverts again presently to the topic of this sponge-caught lunar
atmosphere. I am told by astronomers and physicists that all he tells is
in absolute accordance with what was already known of the moon's
condition. Had earthly astronomers had the courage and imagination to
push home a bold induction, says Mr. Wendigee, they might have foretold
almost everything that Cavor has to say of the general structure of the
moon. They know now pretty certainly that moon and earth are not so much
satellite and primary as smaller and greater sisters, made out of one
mass, and consequently made of the same material. And since the density of
the moon is only three-fifths that of the earth, there can be nothing for
it but that she is hollowed out by a great system of caverns. There was no
necessity, said Sir Jabez Flap, F.R.S., that most entertaining exponent of
the facetious side of the stars, that we should ever have gone to the moon
to find out such easy inferences, and points the pun with an allusion to
Gruyere, but he certainly might have announced his knowledge of the
hollowness of the moon before. And if the moon is hollow, then the
apparent absence of air and water is, of course, quite easily explained.
The sea lies within at the bottom of the caverns, and the air travels
through the great sponge of galleries, in accordance with simple physical
laws. The caverns of the moon, on the whole, are very windy places. As the
sunlight comes round the moon the air in the outer galleries on that side
is heated, its pressure increases, some flows out on the exterior and
mingles with the evaporating air of the craters (where the plants remove
its carbonic acid), while the greater portion flows round through the
galleries to replace the shrinking air of the cooling side that the
sunlight has left. There is, therefore, a constant eastward breeze in the
air of the outer galleries, and an upflow during the lunar day up the
shafts, complicated, of course, very greatly by the varying shape of the
galleries, and the ingenious contrivances of the Selenite mind....
Chapter 24
The Natural History of the Selenites
The messages of Cavor from the sixth up to the sixteenth are for the most
part so much broken, and they abound so in repetitions, that they scarcely
form a consecutive narrative. They will be given in full, of course, in
the scientific report, but here it will be far more convenient to continue
simply to abstract and quote as in the former chapter. We have subjected
every word to a keen critical scrutiny, and my own brief memories and
impressions of lunar things have been of inestimable help in interpreting
what would otherwise have been impenetrably dark. And, naturally, as
living beings, our interest centres far more upon the strange community of
lunar insects in which he was living, it would seem, as an honoured guest
than upon the mere physical condition of their world.
I have already made it clear, I think, that the Selenites I saw resembled
man in maintaining the erect attitude, and in having four limbs, and I
have compared the general appearance of their heads and the jointing of
their limbs to that of insects. I have mentioned, too, the peculiar
consequence of the smaller gravitation of the moon on their fragile
slightness. Cavor confirms me upon all these points. He calls them
"animals," though of course they fall under no division of the
classification of earthly creatures, and he points out "the insect type of
anatomy had, fortunately for men, never exceeded a relatively very small
size on earth." The largest terrestrial insects, living or extinct, do
not, as a matter of fact, measure six inches in length; "but here, against
the lesser gravitation of the moon, a creature certainly as much an insect
as vertebrate seems to have been able to attain to human and ultra-human
dimensions."
He does not mention the ant, but throughout his allusions the ant is
continually being brought before my mind, in its sleepless activity, in
its intelligence and social organisation, in its structure, and more
particularly in the fact that it displays, in addition to the two forms,
the male and the female form, that almost all other animals possess, a
number of other sexless creatures, workers, soldiers, and the like,
differing from one another in structure, character, power, and use, and
yet all members of the same species. For these Selenites, also, have a
great variety of forms. Of course, they are not only colossally greater in
size than ants, but also, in Cavor's opinion at least, in intelligence,
morality, and social wisdom are they colossally greater than men. And
instead of the four or five different forms of ant that are found, there
are almost innumerably different forms of Selenite. I had endeavoured to
indicate the very considerable difference observable in such Selenites of
the outer crust as I happened to encounter; the differences in size and
proportions were certainly as wide as the differences between the most
widely separated races of men. But such differences as I saw fade
absolutely to nothing in comparison with the huge distinctions of which
Cavor tells. It would seem the exterior Selenites I saw were, indeed,
mostly engaged in kindred occupations--mooncalf herds, butchers,
fleshers, and the like. But within the moon, practically unsuspected by
me, there are, it seems, a number of other sorts of Selenite, differing in
size, differing in the relative size of part to part, differing in power
and appearance, and yet not different species of creatures, but only
different forms of one species, and retaining through all their variations
a certain common likeness that marks their specific unity. The moon is,
indeed, a sort of vast ant-hill, only, instead of there being only four or
five sorts of ant, there are many hundred different sorts of Selenite, and
almost every gradation between one sort and another.
It would seem the discovery came upon Cavor very speedily. I infer rather
than learn from his narrative that he was captured by the mooncalf herds
under the direction of these other Selenites who "have larger brain cases
(heads?) and very much shorter legs." Finding he would not walk even under
the goad, they carried him into darkness, crossed a narrow, plank-like
bridge that may have been the identical bridge I had refused, and put him
down in something that must have seemed at first to be some sort of lift.
This was the balloon--it had certainly been absolutely invisible to us in
the darkness--and what had seemed to me a mere plank-walking into the
void was really, no doubt, the passage of the gangway. In this he
descended towards constantly more luminous caverns of the moon. At first
they descended in silence--save for the twitterings of the Selenites--and
then into a stir of windy movement. In a little while the profound
blackness had made his eyes so sensitive that he began to see more and
more of the things about him, and at last the vague took shape.
"Conceive an enormous cylindrical space," says Cavor, in his seventh
message, "a quarter of a mile across, perhaps; very dimly lit at first
and then brighter, with big platforms twisting down its sides in a spiral
that vanishes at last below in a blue profundity; and lit even more
brightly--one could not tell how or why. Think of the well of the very
largest spiral staircase or lift-shaft that you have ever looked down, and
magnify that by a hundred. Imagine it at twilight seen through blue glass.
Imagine yourself looking down that; only imagine also that you feel
extraordinarily light, and have got rid of any giddy feeling you might
have on earth, and you will have the first conditions of my impression.
Round this enormous shaft imagine a broad gallery running in a much
steeper spiral than would be credible on earth, and forming a steep road
protected from the gulf only by a little parapet that vanishes at last in
perspective a couple of miles below.
"Looking up, I saw the very fellow of the downward vision; it had, of
course, the effect of looking into a very steep cone. A wind was blowing
down the shaft, and far above I fancy I heard, growing fainter and
fainter, the bellowing of the mooncalves that were being driven down again
from their evening pasturage on the exterior. And up and down the spiral
galleries were scattered numerous moon people, pallid, faintly luminous
beings, regarding our appearance or busied on unknown errands.
"Either I fancied it or a flake of snow came drifting down on the icy
breeze. And then, falling like a snowflake, a little figure, a little
man-insect, clinging to a parachute, drove down very swiftly towards the
central places of the moon.
"The big-headed Selenite sitting beside me, seeing me move my head with
the gesture of one who saw, pointed with his trunk-like 'hand' and
indicated a sort of jetty coming into sight very far below: a little
landing-stage, as it were, hanging into the void. As it swept up towards
us our pace diminished very rapidly, and in a few moments, as it seemed,
we were abreast of it, and at rest. A mooring-rope was flung and grasped,
and I found myself pulled down to a level with a great crowd of Selenites,
who jostled to see me.
"It was an incredible crowd. Suddenly and violently there was forced upon
my attention the vast amount of difference there is amongst these beings
of the moon.
"Indeed, there seemed not two alike in all that jostling multitude. They
differed in shape, they differed in size, they rang all the horrible
changes on the theme of Selenite form! Some bulged and overhung, some ran
about among the feet of their fellows. All of them had a grotesque and
disquieting suggestion of an insect that has somehow contrived to mock
humanity; but all seemed to present an incredible exaggeration of some
particular feature: one had a vast right fore-limb, an enormous antennal
arm, as it were; one seemed all leg, poised, as it were, on stilts;
another protruded the edge of his face mask into a nose-like organ that
made him startlingly human until one saw his expressionless gaping mouth.
The strange and (except for the want of mandibles and palps) most
insect-like head of the mooncalf-minders underwent, indeed, the most
incredible transformations: here it was broad and low, here high and
narrow; here its leathery brow was drawn out into horns and strange
features; here it was whiskered and divided, and there with a grotesquely
human profile. One distortion was particularly conspicuous. There were
several brain cases distended like bladders to a huge size, with the face
mask reduced to quite small proportions. There were several amazing forms,
with heads reduced to microscopic proportions and blobby bodies; and
fantastic, flimsy things that existed, it would seem, only as a basis for
vast, trumpet-like protrusions of the lower part of the mask. And oddest
of all, as it seemed to me for the moment, two or three of these weird
inhabitants of a subterranean world, a world sheltered by innumerable
miles of rock from sun or rain, _carried umbrellas_ in their tentaculate
hands--real terrestrial looking umbrellas! And then I thought of the
parachutist I had watched descend.
"These moon people behaved exactly as a human crowd might have done in
similar circumstances: they jostled and thrust one another, they shoved
one another aside, they even clambered upon one another to get a glimpse
of me. Every moment they increased in numbers, and pressed more urgently
upon the discs of my ushers"--Cavor does not explain what he means by
this--"every moment fresh shapes emerged from the shadows and forced
themselves upon my astounded attention. And presently I was signed and
helped into a sort of litter, and lifted up on the shoulders of
strong-armed bearers, and so borne through the twilight over this seething
multitude towards the apartments that were provided for me in the moon.
All about me were eyes, faces, masks, a leathery noise like the rustling
of beetle wings, and a great bleating and cricket-like twittering of
Selenite voices."
We gather he was taken to a "hexagonal apartment," and there for a space
he was confined. Afterwards he was given a much more considerable liberty;
indeed, almost as much freedom as one has in a civilised town on earth.
And it would appear that the mysterious being who is the ruler and master
of the moon appointed two Selenites "with large heads" to guard and study
him, and to establish whatever mental communications were possible with
him. And, amazing and incredible as it may seem, these two creatures,
these fantastic men insects, these beings of other world, were presently
communicating with Cavor by means of terrestrial speech.
Cavor speaks of them as Phi-oo and Tsi-puff. Phi-oo, he says, was about 5
feet high; he had small slender legs about 18 inches long, and slight feet
of the common lunar pattern. On these balanced a little body, throbbing
with the pulsations of his heart. He had long, soft, many-jointed arms
ending in a tentacled grip, and his neck was many-jointed in the usual

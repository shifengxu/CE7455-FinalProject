Alton Sterling’s son: ’Everyone needs to protest the right way, with peace’
The son of a Louisiana man whose father was shot and killed at   range by Baton Rouge police asked protesters for “peace” and “no violence, none whatsoever”. Cameron Sterling, the    son of Alton Sterling, whose death at the hands of police was caught on video, spoke about his father and protests.  Alton Sterling was killed by Baton Rouge police on 5 July at a convenience store, where he was said to be selling CDs. Baton Rouge police said in a statement that police were called to the convenience store because Sterling had allegedly threatened another patron with a gun.  The press conference on Wednesday is Cameron’s first since he broke into sobs at a nationally broadcast press conference with his mother, following his father’s death. “I came to talk to everyone about one: the death of my father. And, two: about how I feel about people in general,” said Cameron, whose distinctly young voice was calm and composed in front of the scrum of reporters at the Triple S convenience store. “People, in general, no matter what the race, should come together as one united family. “No more arguments, violence, crimes,” said Cameron. “Yes, you can protest, but I want everyone to protest the right way. Protest in peace  —   no guns, no drugs, no alcohol, no violence. Everyone needs to protest in the right way, with peace. No violence, none whatsoever. ” Earlier on Wednesday, in an interview with CBS News, Cameron said he didn’t believe all police were “bad” and that all police “shouldn’t be punished for other police’s crimes”. “The police in Dallas, Texas, they didn’t deserve that,” said Cameron. Alton Sterling’s death spurred a Department of Justice investigation, protests across the country, and was one of the subjects of a march in Dallas on Thursday when a gunman attacked and killed five police officers there.  His was the first of two police shootings that week, including a shocking video of the shooting of Minnesota man Philandro Castile, the aftermath of which was broadcast live on Facebook by his girlfriend.

Shakespeare’s first four folios sell at auction for almost £2.5m
Copies of William Shakespeare’s first four books, dubbed the “Holy Grail of publishing” have sold for almost £2. 5m at auction. Christie’s said they were sold as separate lots on Wednesday but were all bought by an anonymous private American collector. The £2, 479, 000 sale in London included the bard’s first folio, which is widely considered to be the most important literary publication in the English language. The book, published in 1623, contains 36 plays, 18 of which had not appeared in print before. It fetched £1. 87m, well above its   estimate of between £800, 000 and £1. 2m. Christie’s book expert Margaret Ford said it was “exhilarating” to bring the newly recorded book to the public’s attention on the 400th anniversary of the playwright’s death. It was sold along with later editions published in 1632, 1664 and 1685. Ford said: “We are pleased with the results achieved in the sale especially since all four books were acquired by the same private American collector. The universality and timelessness of Shakespeare’s insight into human nature continues to engage and enthral audiences the world over. “Even four centuries after his death, his plays touch and transform lives and continue to be read and performed from Albania to Zambia. ”

My grandmother’s death saved me from a life of debt
Debt: $20, 000, Source: College, credit cards, Estimated time till debt free: Unclear, From a purely financial standpoint, my grandmother’s death is probably the best thing that has happened to me in my adult life.  My grandmother came from overseas to live with my mother and me when I was in high school, as the ravages of Alzheimer’s left her unable to care for herself. This was a difficult situation for everyone and money became tight. But I did enjoy getting to spend time with my grandmother, who I seldom got to visit while growing up. Some of the fondest memories I have of her are from this time. We would sit together on the sofa and watch her favorite television show  —   Jeopardy!  —   even if she wasn’t exactly sure who I was.  I did well in high school and chose to attend a prestigious (and expensive) private university, far away from home. I had won some scholarship money for my academic merits. Although the amount of debt I would have after graduating was apparent up front, I did not fully understand it. That large figure seemed so abstract at the time, and I refused to let it dampen my excitement about going to college. I set out to earn more than one degree, which cost me more money. Significant surcharges were added to my tuition for taking excessive credit hours, and even larger fees were incurred when enrolling in summer classes I had to take in order to keep up. Thus the waters of debt started to flood higher than they were supposed to.  I delivered pizzas, worked at the library, tutored and worked an array of other   jobs. This did nothing to abate these rising floodwaters, although the extra money did help me manage the several credit card accounts I was forced to open during this time to pay for food, gas, rent and utilities. I graduated in 4. 5 years with two bachelor of science degrees and two minors, along with nearly a quarter of a million dollars in cumulative debt, mostly from student loans. I wouldn’t change any part of my journey. I met some amazing, lifelong friends in college. I received a   education from truly inspirational professors. And I had the opportunity to work in a laboratory and contribute to meaningful scientific research studying Alzheimer’s disease.  I strongly desired to go to graduate school. I wanted to pursue scientific research in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately, this was unfeasible in light of my debt. Graduate students do not typically earn attractive incomes.  It was around this time that my grandmother passed due to complications following her long struggle with Alzheimer’s disease. To be sure it was a sad event, as it always is when a loved one dies. But my grandmother had become chronically bedridden, a frail shell of a human being, unable even to recognize her own daughter  —   my mother  —   toward the end.  The coming of death was, I think, a merciful one: it seems that we should pity the living, not the dead. After it happened, my mother looked as though a weight had fallen off her shoulders. She wasn’t the only one whose burden would be lessened by the loss. After her death, my grandmother’s finances, assets and properties were entrusted to my mother. She liquidated nearly all of it, deciding that the best way of putting it to use was by helping me repay my student loan debt.  This was a massive relief from a suffocating situation. My remaining $20, 000 in credit card debt is manageable, although I do not know when I will be completely free of it. I shudder to think of how my situation would be were it not for my grandmother’s “contribution”. I now work three jobs  —   one   and two    —   in order to manage the remaining debt, along with the expense of living in a major metropolitan area. Despite my two degrees and prior work in scientific research, I earn just above minimum wage working   in a laboratory at a     dollar biomedical research institution.  The pay could be better, but I consider myself very fortunate to still be able to work doing scientific research related to neurodegenerative diseases, a field I remain passionate about for obvious reasons. Which is all a bit ironic considering that Alzheimer’s disease is, indirectly, the only reason I’m not utterly drowning right now.

I feared my life lacked meaning. Cancer pushed me to find some
It was late. I was drunk, nearing my 35th birthday this past May, alone in a dank college dorm room, attending my   grad school reunion. The journal entry I wrote that night was just one line: “I’m not the man I want to be. ” As reunion charades go, nothing about my life actually suggested I was off track. I had ambitious public service aspirations worked tenaciously loved fiercely wrote confidently about equal opportunity and the American dream bought into and unabashedly endorsed my adopted hometown of Detroit as the best place in the country to work with meaning and purpose. I’d published a book. I’d supported my wife through cancer, relapse, and now four years of remission. I even ran a marathon. But my journal admission reflected two longstanding personal challenges. First, despite all my accomplishments, I carried a deeply held internal anxiety about being “good enough” to meet my ambitions. Second, I believed my alcohol abuse posed a serious threat to it all. Combined, they exposed my biggest fear: was my life of meaning and purpose as I envisioned it slipping through my fingers? I decided to make a change. After nearly 20 years of various cycles of alcohol abuse, moderation and abstinence, I concluded I would take one last shot at forging a balanced approach to drinking before turning to sobriety. I’d read about a drug called naltrexone, which is a pill that helps mitigate and manage alcohol cravings and abuse. After sporadically trying it over the prior year, I decided to use it every day for the next three months. Change came quickly. Two months in, my weekly consumption had cut in half it would cut in half again by early October. I lost 20 pounds and felt great. In tears, I confided to my wife, “I’ve finally broken through. ”  “I’m so proud of you,” my wife replied. “I’m so grateful you found a path that works. Let’s stick with it. ” That was Monday, 10 October. Two days later, I was diagnosed with stage IV kidney cancer. Less than 15% of people with my diagnosis survive five years. This prompted a swift resolution of my other core challenge: I would no longer allow my anxiety about “living the right way” interfere with being my true self in all dimensions of this life. There would no longer be any distinction between the “representative version” of me online versus living every day with full authenticity. Any other way would be a total waste of time.  I’ve embraced the news as an invitation to be my most honest, vulnerable and wholehearted self. I live every day as fully integrated and courageously as possible. I don’t waver. One key outlet has been a podcast I started with my wife and best friend called Defending Your Life, where we process in real time the unfiltered experience, fears and reality of dealing with stage IV cancer. I write now more directly, less esoterically, about my experience on my blog. Although my opportunities to achieve my public service or other professional goals down the road may now be limited by time or strength, I now know they won’t be hobbled by inauthenticity. Most importantly, I’ve come to recognize that I have lived a life of meaning and purpose. A life rich with love and connection. Some have even generously shared that I’ve lived a life that has inspired others. And, having worked through my demons, I’m able to forgive and be proud of myself too. Of course, what’s scary now is while there is so much to live for, this disease, despite all the science, love and everything else needed to take it on, could very well ultimately beat me. I had surgery in October and am facing upcoming systemic treatments over the next   months, and it remains to be seen whether that will make me one of the  % who achieve a “complete response” or the 94% who end up somewhere else along the kidney cancer progression line. The truth is, we’re all terminal. I could also get hit by a bus tomorrow. Or I could beat the odds and live till I’m 90. But whatever my time left on this earth, I’ll now endeavor forward with some earned resolve. I am the person I want to be. I’m not afraid.

Texas man serving life sentence innocent of double murder, judge says
A central Texas man serving a life sentence for a double murder in 1992 is innocent, as are three codefendants no longer in prison, a state judge has found. Retired district judge George Allen ruled Friday that Richard Bryan Kussmaul, 45, should be free. His three codefendants each received   sentences and have already been released.  DNA evidence not available two decades ago shows the four weren’t involved in the fatal shootings of    Leslie Murphy and    Stephen Neighbors at a home near Moody, south of Waco, Allen said in a   opinion.  Allen’s recommendation now goes to the Texas court of criminal appeals for a final decision. The state’s top criminal appeals court had ordered a hearing held last month to look into the men’s claims they were innocent.  “The evidence just seemed overwhelming, with the DNA evidence having excluded these men from any contact whatsoever with these people,” Kussmaul’s lawyer, David Sheppard, told the Waco  . Allen presided over the trial where Kussmaul was convicted of murder. His three   James Edward Long, Michael Dewayne Shelton and James Wayne Pitts Jr, were convicted of sexual assault. Long and Pitts served 20 years. Shelton was released after 17 years.  At the hearing last month, Long, Shelton and Pitts all testified they gave false testimony against Kussmaul at his trial because a prosecutor promised them probation. They also said their confessions were coerced by a deputy who threatened them with the death penalty. The three said at Kussmaul’s trial in 1994 that he and they raped Murphy before Kussmaul shot the two victims. After they were sentenced to 20 years in prison, each recanted his confession. Kussmaul did not testify at the hearing.  “I was willing to say anything they wanted me to say because I thought I was getting probation and no prison time,” Long said at the July hearing. “I had two small children and I was afraid of going to prison for life or, worse, getting executed. ”  If the court upholds the judge’s opinion and the men’s claims of actual innocence, they each could be eligible for a state payout of $80, 000 for each year in prison.

My dad’s Reagan protests inspire me to stand up to Donald Trump
I have been battling depression and sleeplessness while thinking about how to fight Donald Trump and what his rise means about the United States of America. It is dispiriting that after both modest and substantial gains have been made during the Obama and Black Lives Matter years (on race, gender, political imagination, LGBT rights and healthcare) many stand to be rolled back with a vengeance in the coming months and years. The retrenchment is frightening. And it’s become clear that this fight is going to last for the rest of my life. For advice on how to deal with this, I turned to my late father, Bill Thrasher. He was an air force sergeant who went to night school as an adult to become a high school and community college teacher of US and “Afro American” history. My dad died suddenly, in 2003, while teaching a class full of students a blood clot killed him instantly while he was lecturing about the civil war and the reconstruction. His sudden death broke my heart, but he left me with a road map: the example of a civil rights life well lived, a binder of newspaper clippings from a column he wrote in our local newspaper, and a single audio recording of a monthly radio show in Ventura, California, he hosted called Minority Perspective. That sole episode I have was broadcast on 7 December 1986. It was Pearl Harbor day, and the height of Reagan’s   affair. In it, Dad laments his sadness after the previous month’s election, when California voters   a deeply conservative governor. Here’s a passage which gave me life after Trump was elected:  Conservatism, by its nature, is racism. It’s racism only because conservatism simply means to conserve, to preserve the status quo. And the status quo with respect to minorities, is: “Stay in your place! Remain the same, exactly where you’re at. Be the victims of discrimination! Do not protest. Let the laws stand as they are. Do not enact laws that will try to redress grievances. ” So when the county of Ventura, the state of California, and the United States of America votes to support conservative candidates who represent those viewpoints, it is saying to us, the minorities: “It’s gone too far! You must stay in your place. There will be no more change. You must continue wherever you are at. You will always be on the low end of the pole economically and politically. ” And that is why it is so difficult for Afro Americans to accept the conservatives, no matter who they happen to be, whether they are in the Republican party or the Democratic party. Because conservatism, by its very nature, is racist! It’s  . It’s   American. It’s  . It’s   American. It’s   American. It’s   that isn’t white, Anglo Saxon, Protestant male. Because that group wants to preserve what it has illegally gained and wishes to continue  —   in politics, and in economics. And it will use the political institution to keep their gains, even though they weren’t gained honestly or legally. That’s my objection to conservatism. Conservatism will prevent my children and my grandchildren from fulfilling their destiny as Americans. My children and my grandchildren, as well as I am, as well my father and my grandfather and my   were   citizens and are   citizens, and conservatism wants to keep us as   citizens.  I am not going to accept that! I will spend all of my energies fighting that type of thought, and I urge all minorities  —   not just Afro Americans, but all minorities  —   to resist this. We have to do whatever we can, everywhere, wherever we’re at, in whatever capacity we’re in, to keep the issue alive  —   to keep pushing, to keep probing, to keep challenging, until we have forged our way into the economic and political system, where we have a control our of destiny, and not have to leave it in control of people who are antagonistic toward us, who hate us, who do not want to see us have a share in the American dream. Listening to my father fighting Reaganism, 30 years ago next week, is both depressing and freeing as I think about fighting Trumpism. I feel depressed that the same issues he fought remain so present some three decades later  —   issues that won’t be solved in my lifetime. But I also feel less alone in knowing that I am connected to him  —   and to my ancestors and nieces and nephews  —   in an intergenerational struggle for a better America. Even if the fight doesn’t end with me, I hope to ease the path for those who follow, or at least give the comfort that my father’s words lend me today.  Trump and his ilk will try to say “stay in your place” to all of us who aren’t conservative white men accommodationist white liberals will do so, as well.  Fortunately, I know where (and who) I come from, and I can listen to my dad pushing back on Reaganism to guide me when I feel lost in Trumpland. If you, too, are feeling down about the fight ahead, don’t be afraid to ask your elders for guidance. They might just show the way towards the   road just when you need it most.

Flatmates of gay Syrian refugee beheaded in Turkey fear they will be next
Three flatmates of a gay Syrian refugee beheaded in a homophobic attack in Turkey last week fear they face a similar fate, after receiving death threats in the days since his murder. Wisam Sankari, a hospital cleaner, went missing on 25 July after going to meet another gay man in Istanbul. His body was found two days later in a nearby area of Istanbul, his head severed and his battered body only identifiable to his friends by his clothing. A week on, three of his flatmates say they fear being murdered in the same fashion after receiving warnings that the man Sankari met on 25 July wants to kill them too. “There have been people in the street and people on the phone, who said: ‘He will get you next,’” said one of Sankari’s friends, a chef who, like his flatmates, asked to remain anonymous for safety reasons. “There was also a voice message on Facebook. ” In an interview with the Guardian in Sankari’s former room, a cramped lodging he shared with five other people, his friends said he had been in fear during the last months of his life after Turkish officials, UN diplomats and charity workers had proved unable to protect him following a series of homophobic attacks. A Greek appeals board said in June that it considers Turkey safe enough for gay Syrians to be deported to as part of the controversial   migration deal. But Sankari’s friends say his experiences show how dangerous the country is for gay refugees, and unstable for refugees in general. They alleged that in the months before his death, Sankari had: “Do you call this safe?” summarised a second of Sankari’s flatmates, as they listened to their friend’s favourite song and watched a video made in his honour. “We don’t have an organisation to protect us. We want everyone in Europe to understand our situation here for Syrians, especially gays. We’re suffering. ” This was the third brutal attack Sankari had experienced, the flatmate continued. “Five months ago, he was attacked and his head was cut,” he said. “He went to the police, but they didn’t help him. [Another time] he was put in a car and he had to throw himself from it [to survive]. ” Then at 12. 20am on 25 July, he got a call from a Syrian who had recently arrived in Istanbul. “He went to see him, and he never came back. Two days later we heard he was dead. ” Sankari’s murder was one of at least 20 homophobic attacks on Syrian refugees in the past six months, according to an activist who is documenting such incidents. “Turkey is not a safe place, it’s not a   place,” said Hossam, a Syrian who organises a weekly support session for gay refugees in Istanbul, and who asked to be identified only by his first name. “And with the political situation in the country, it’s not getting better. ” More generally, Sankari’s friends said many of his other experiences showed how vulnerable life is for refugees of any sexuality in Turkey. Despite recent legislative changes, the vast majority of the 2. 7 million Syrians in Turkey have no realistic chance of accessing the legal labour market, forcing them to work illegally in exploitative conditions that contravene the UN refugee convention. Sankari was one such case. His latest employers paid him about half the Turkish minimum wage (600 Turkish lira, or £150) for a hospital cleaning job that saw him work seven days a week. If he complained, he risked being fired during previous employment as a waiter at a cafe, he was sacked for asking for time off to recover from illness. “We’re working as animals,” said one of Sankari’s friends, a literature graduate who was a teacher in Syria but now works as a waiter in Turkey. “No one is working at what they studied for. We work here   hours a day. We don’t have a weekend. The Turks want us to work and work and work  —   without money or rights. ” Sankari’s battles with Turkish bureaucracy also highlight the basic logistical challenges Syrians face on a daily basis in Turkey. Sankari struggled to access support from aid groups and officials in Istanbul because he had first registered with the Turkish government in Hatay, a city near the country’s southern borders.  To apply for resettlement in the west, or to secure even basic support from   NGOs, Sankari needed to return to Hatay. But he was scared to do so because of threats he had faced while briefly living there, said Hossam, who had met Sankari at his weekly   session. “He was desperately seeking help but he couldn’t reach anyone,” said Hossam. It is a depressingly familiar situation, the activist added. “During my time with the group, I’ve witnessed a lot of serious threats, a lot of hate crimes, people who have experienced incidents that didn’t necessarily end their life, but [involved] beatings, rape and abuse,” said Hossam. “And those people couldn’t reach places where they felt safe and secure. They had to deal with this on their own. ”  A senior government official said: “We are unable to independently verify the claim that the victim’s plea for assistance was ignored by law enforcement. Obviously, this barbaric attack doesn’t reflect the way Syrian refugees are treated in Turkey, which is the largest host of refugees in the world. We are investigating this incident and will take all necessary steps to bring perpetrators to justice. ” In a statement, the UN refugee agency said it was working to resettle LGBTI refugees currently living in Turkey, and expressed sadness about Sankari’s death. A spokesperson added: “We are very sorry and we would like to express our shock and sadness at this appalling crime. We are looking forward to seeing that investigation of the case by the officials concluded asap and perpetrators are brought to justice. “Syrian refugees in Turkey are given temporary protection by the government of Turkey, which is primarily responsible for their protection in the country. UNHCR does not register or document Syrian refugees in Turkey. ”

Jaffas and daredevils: life on the world’s steepest street
, Most people take 10 minutes to climb the world’s steepest residential street. But Bindi Bezar, who works in a   gift shop near the bottom, does it in seven. “I have angina and climbing 276 steps is cheaper than going to the gym,” said Bezar. Baldwin Street, located on the north face of Signal Hill in Dunedin, New Zealand, is booming. Since being listed in the Guinness Book of Records for its exhausting 1:3 gradient, it has enjoyed local interest. But now Dunedin is a stopping point for international cruise ships, the street has become the top tourist destination in New Zealand’s oldest city.  In the busy season between October and February, hundreds of tourists visit the street each day, starting at 6am and often continuing until dark  —   which in the summer can be 11pm.  It has also become a hot spot for daredevil sports enthusiasts   who trike, bike and slide down the slope in anything with wheels.  In response, a host of entrepreneurial residents have opened gift shops and food outlets  —   with more permanent infrastructure such as public toilets potentially on the horizon.  Beverley McClay has lived on the street for nine years, and delights in the growing popularity of her home. From her porch, she often watches strangers open her gate, potter around her garden, and occasionally  —   and most unwelcomely  —   relieve themselves in her Corokia hedge.  “I think a lot of tourists don’t know this is a real street, that people actually live here,” she laughs.  “It’s very social, very busy. I often come out in my dressing grown to meet people, and the tourists like to watch me stacking wood, they ask me what I am doing. ” McClay, who lives alone, says the street’s fame has stopped her from becoming lonely as the years go by.  “It makes me feel like I am part of a community here, there’s always someone just outside my door. ” In the past year Baldwin Street has also become a   destination in an unusual social media trend to snap pictures at odd angles, which create the optical illusion of the houses being severely lopsided. The trend has significantly increased visitor numbers  —   especially during the winter season when tourists usually avoided the area because of frost, ice and occasional snow. However, to McClay’s disappointment, people are now tending to drive to the top of the street instead of walking, and preferring to use selfie sticks rather than asking residents to take their picture.  On Friday, the street was crammed with an estimated 15, 000 people for the annual Jaffa race, in which 75, 000 chocolate balls were rolled down the hill. “It’s my busiest day of the year,” said Bezar, who has become particularly fond of the visiting ship’s captains, whose drinks she always serves first.  “I know it’s just a street, but most of the residents here are so friendly, it’s also become a really good way to have a chat to a Kiwi. And  —   it’s free. ”

NSA contractor arrested for alleged theft of top secret classified information
The FBI has arrested a National Security Agency contractor on suspicion of the theft of top secret classified data and documents in an alleged security breach at the same intelligence agency whose spy secrets were exposed by Edward Snowden. Disclosure of the documents stolen “could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the US” claimed the justice department in a press release giving details of the criminal complaint against Harold Thomas Martin III, 51, of Glen Burnie, Maryland. He was charged with theft of government property and unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials by a government employee or contractor, and, it emerged on Wednesday, has been in detention since a court appearance on 29 August.  Details of the arrest were first reported by the New York Times, which suggested the breach involved the possible theft of highly classified computer code developed to hack into the networks of foreign governments. “There is no evidence that Hal Martin intended to betray his country,” said Martin’s attorneys Jim Wyda and Deborah Boardman in a statement, according to the Washington Post. “What we do know is that Hal Martin loves his family and his country. He served honorably in the United States Navy as a lieutenant and he has devoted his entire career to protecting his country. We look forward to defending Hal Martin in court. ” They said the charges against Martin were “mere allegations” and they had not yet seen prosecutors’ evidence.  The justice department confirmed that Martin worked for the same company as Snowden when he exposed details of NSA mass surveillance methods three years ago. Martin has been in custody since a court appearance in August. According to the New York Times, Martin is suspected of taking the “source code” developed by the agency to break into computer systems of adversaries like Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.  Snowden, who remains in exile in Russia, facing charges under the Espionage Act, reacted to the details of the arrest, tweeting to his 2. 4 million followers: “This is huge. Did the FBI secretly arrest the person behind the reports NSA sat on huge flaws in US products?” The White House said Barack Obama took the national security implications seriously. Press secretary Josh Earnest told a briefing: “I think any time that information like this is released in the context of a criminal complaint, the federal government is reminded of how important is it to be vigilant about protecting the national security of the country and information that is relevant to our national security. “So this is certainly a situation that the Department of Justice takes seriously, as evidenced by their complaint, but this is a situation that President Obama takes quite seriously, and it is a good reminder for all of us with security clearances about how important is it for us to protect sensitive national security information. ” The justice department confirmed: “A criminal complaint has been filed charging Harold Thomas Martin III, 51, of Glen Burnie, Maryland, with theft of government property and unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials by a government employee or contractor. ” The assistant attorney general for national security, John Carlin, US attorney Rod Rosenstein for the District of Maryland and special agent in charge Gordon Johnson of the FBI’s Baltimore field office made the announcement. According to the affidavit, Martin was a contractor with the federal government and had a top secret national security clearance. He was arrested late on 27 August as search warrants were executed at his home, two storage sheds and his vehicle on a leafy suburban street outside of Baltimore. “I heard a boom and went to the ground,” Dave Cunningham, who lives a couple of doors down from Martin and described himself as a “lifer” in the neighborhood, said of the raid on Martin’s home. He said he thought it was a gunshot. But when he looked out the window, he saw numerous law enforcement vehicles, including two large vans that parked in front of the house. Glen Bond, who has lived in a house across the street from Bond for 50 years, said there were two big vans in front of the house blocking it from view and “25 or 30 cars”. “They were in camouflaged uniforms, two dozen of them. They were serious. Helmets, rifles,” Murray Bennett, who lives next door to Martin, said. “Big guns,” Bond said. “When they came they took out a whole bunch of stuff but it was all in black trash bags. You couldn’t see anything. ” A woman who came to the door of Martin’s home said: “This is a matter that’s under investigation. I have no comment . .. I’d appreciate it if you’d leave from the front of my house so my dogs will calm down and I can get some peace. ” Neighbors describe Martin and the woman he lives with  —   no one could say whether they were married  —   as “nice” “decent” and “peaceful”. During execution of the warrants, investigators found   documents and digital information stored on various devices and removable digital media. “A large percentage of the materials recovered from Martin’s residence and vehicle bore markings indicating that they were property of the US government and contained highly classified information, including Top Secret and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). In addition, investigators located property of the US government with an aggregate value in excess of $1, 000, which Martin allegedly stole,” a justice department press statement said. Martin is said to have had six classified documents obtained from sensitive intelligence and produced by a government agency in 2014. “These documents were produced through sensitive government sources, methods and capabilities, which are critical to a wide variety of national security issues. The disclosure of the documents would reveal those sensitive sources, methods and capabilities,” the justice department said. The documents have been reviewed by a government agency and designated as top secret, “meaning that unauthorized disclosure reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the US” the justice department statement said. If convicted, Martin faces a maximum sentence of one year in prison for the unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials and 10 years in prison for theft of government property. An initial appearance was held for Martin in US district court in Baltimore on 29 August and he is still detained. The arrest is a major embarrassment for the NSA and its contractor Booz Allen coming just three years after Snowden, who worked for both. The NSA said in the wake of the Snowden revelations in 2013 it had tightened up internal security, introducing more stringent monitoring of staff and a   system in which sensitive information needed two people to access it rather than just one. Highly classified information would no longer be concentrated in one place, making it harder for potential hackers. The new breach provides fresh arguments for privacy activists who argue that the NSA cannot be trusted to protect all the personal data it gathers, from bank accounts to health records. Supporters of Snowden quickly made a distinction between him and the motives of the arrested man. They reiterated that Snowden is a whistleblower who leaked top secret material out of principle, believing the NSA was acting unconstitutionally by engaging in mass surveillance. It was not yet clear what motivated the latest alleged leaker. Snowden, who had worked for the CIA and the NSA, handed over material to journalists at the Guardian in 2013 when he was employed by Booz Allen as contractor to the NSA. As a computer specialist based in Hawaii, he was engaged in a number of operations, including targeting China. Flying from Hawaii, where he was based, to Hong Kong, he gave tens of thousands of top secret documents to journalists to illustrate the scale of surveillance by the NSA and Britain’s GCHQ. The documents also revealed the extent to which major US tech companies were cooperating with the NSA in providing details from customer accounts. Glenn Greenwald, one of the journalists who was given material by Snowden, rounded on the NSA for its lack of security. “Nobody is more inept at securing its own data than NSA. But trust them to keep all yours safe and secure. ” Jesselyn Radack, a US lawyer who represents whistleblowers, was among those quick to caution journalists about making comparisons with Snowden. In a tweet, she wrote: “Mediapls stop comparing theft of NSA source code to @Snowden blowing whistle on secret domestic surveillance. ”

Donald Trump to dissolve his charitable foundation after mounting complaints
Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he will shut down his charitable foundation, a response to mounting complaints over conflicts related to the  ’s charitable and business interests. In a statement released by his campaign, Trump said the Donald J Trump Foundation would be “dissolved” to avoid “even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President”. Trump said he would continue to pursue his “strong interest in philanthropy” in other ways. The closure of the Trump Foundation, which was first reported by the New York Times, requires the approval of the New York attorney general’s office, which is currently investigating the nonprofit and issued a cease and desist order to it in October. The Donald J Trump Foundation was repeatedly the subject of controversy throughout the presidential campaign after a series of investigations by the Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold. Trump reportedly used $258, 000 of the foundation’s money to pay for personal legal settlements. He also spent charitable funds on multiple portraits of himself and on a football helmet autographed by Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow. The foundation also made a donation to a political group supporting Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, a longtime Trump backer in violation of tax law. The   has since paid $2, 500 to the Internal Revenue Service over the donation. Trump had not donated to his own foundation since 2008 the nonprofit relied on donations from other Trump associates, including professional wrestling magnates Vince and Linda McMahon, who gave $5m to the Trump Foundation. Linda McMahon has since been announced as Trump’s nominee to lead the Small Business Administration. The decision also comes as Trump’s children have been under scrutiny for charitable efforts that raised questions over whether people were paying for access to the incoming president and his family.  A celebrity auction for a coffee date with Ivanka Trump, sponsored by Eric Trump’s charity, was called off earlier in December because donors were apparently given an attempt to curry favor with the incoming president and buy access to one of his closest advisers. Both Eric and his brother, Don Jr, were also scheduled to appear at a reception on behalf of conservation charities over the weekend of the inauguration. The reception, which has since been canceled, reportedly promised the opportunity to meet the   in exchange for $1m in donations. These issues have come as Trump’s entire real estate business has come under scrutiny for potential conflicts of interest. In particular, Trump’s international properties have the potential to violate the emoluments clause of the constitution, which prohibits anyone holding “an office of profit or trust” from accepting “any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince or foreign state”. But these conflicts also apply domestically, as the Kuwaiti government has already announced that it is shifting its annual party in February to Trump’s new hotel in Washington. The issues are further amplified because the Trump Organization is a privately held corporation and the   has flouted longstanding tradition in not releasing his tax returns. The result is that there is no clear way to know what assets and liabilities Trump has. It is known, though, that Trump owes $364m to Deutsche Bank. A news conference that the   promised to hold on the topic on 15 December has since been postponed until sometime in January 2017.

Serbian Olympic rowers sink in ferocious conditions on Rio waters
Most Olympic rowers have spent months fretting and prepping about the dangers of   mosquitos and adenoviruses lurking in the Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas. Few, though, were ready to face vicious crosswinds and waters so choppy that it left a Serbian boat capsized and others claiming these were the worst conditions they had ever encountered. Matt Smith, the executive director of rowing’s governing body, Fisa, defended the decision not to postpone racing  —   but warned rowers that conditions were likely to get even worse on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, which could even lead to rounds being cancelled. “It’s a small regatta, with 550 rowers, so we can pretty easily make up one day,” he said. “But if we get two or three knocked out then we go into contingency mode, and into scenarios where we possible drop rounds. We told team managers on Thursday that if you lose rounds of racing, your results from previous races could determine your placement in finals or  . They are on notice that every race matters because if we lose two or three days’ racing it could be the case. ” Smith was speaking after loud complaints about racing on the opening day being allowed to go ahead, despite the weather, which led to several rowers nearly capsizing before the Serbian men’s pair of Milos Vasic and Nenad Bedik went into the water when their boat caught a crab. Usually rowers have to finish the course to be allowed to race again in the repechage. Fisa, however, ruled that because of the conditions and the fact they were behind in the schedule, the rowers could take a DNF  —   did not finish  —   and still compete in the repechage on Sunday at 9. 30am. Fisa also denied that the Serbians faced any dangers from falling into the water. “It is nearly drinking water,” Smith said. “It’s swimming quality. It’s really good. Some might say there are viruses there, but it’s amazingly good right now. ” Most rowers did not take such a rosy view. The Australian Kim Brennan, a competitor in single sculls, was a particularly vociferous critic, insisting the course was “not rowable”. “I do think it should have been called off,” she said. “And speaking to a lot of rowers in the boat park there’s a lot of discontent. We’ve put 10 years plus into this and to have it decided on a little bit of lottery, and what waves hit a boat at a particular time, is a little bit disappointing. ” Every race had its dramas that went beyond seeing who would cross the line first. At one point, the American sculler Genevra Stone nearly sunk like, well, a stone. While the Egyptian sculler Nadia Negm reckoned the conditions were the worst in which she had rowed. “I actually thought I was going to sink it was so rough,” Negm said. “At one point, just past 1, 000m, there were these huge waves and a full one came right into my boat and the water was up to my seat. I was 100% sure I was going to sink, and then another wave came up and I just stopped and froze. Thank God I didn’t go under. It’s the toughest conditions I have ever rowed in. It was really intense. I wish the rest of the racers good luck  —   if you are rowing this week you better know how to swim. ” Meanwhile, the Irish sculler Sanita Puspure, who finished one place ahead of Negm in second, described the conditions as “horrific”. She said: “It was like sailing, surfing, everything all in one and a bit of rowing in the end. I was just thrown around with the wind. I couldn’t get the blades in at the same time. At one stage I was blown parallel to the racing lane so I had to tack with one arm into the lane, which is probably unseen before  —   a person doing   rowing during a race. I was pretty helpless. ” But Britain’s Kath Grainger  —   who, along with her partner, Vicky Thornley, qualified for the double sculls semi‑finals by finishing second in her heat  —   disagreed. While saying that it was “the worst Olympic conditions I have raced in” she felt it was right to race on. “If the regatta runs you have to race in whatever the conditions are,” she insisted. The British sculler Alan Campbell, who looked particularly impressive in winning his heat, claimed the conditions reminded him of coastal rowing. He said: “I thought I must be losing time and I looked around and there was a blade in the air and one down there. ” “The wind comes down from the mountain,” he added, pointing to the most famous landmark on the Rio skyline. “Christ The Redeemer needs to spread his arms out a little more. ”

The strange case of Pamela Anderson’s news-hogging vegan sandwich
Name: Pamela Anderson. Age: 49. Occupation: Definitely not Julian Assange’s murderer. You stated that a little too confidently for my liking. It’s true, though. Anderson absolutely didn’t murder Assange with a Pret vegan sandwich on Saturday. Not even a bit. I mean, by those standards, neither did I. But Anderson really didn’t. Can we track this back to the beginning for a second? Sure. On Saturday, Anderson visited Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. She brought him a vegan sandwich from Pret. And he remained staunchly unmurdered. I’m so confused. Was she supposed to murder him? No, not at all. But he went quiet after the visit, and rumours began to swirl that he was dead from Anderson’s bready hand. Is this real life? Did this actually happen? Yes, and it was exacerbated when Wikileaks began tweeting things such as “  1: John Kerry 4bb96075acadc3d80b5ac872874c3037a386f4f595fe99e687439aabd0219809” which some people read as a dead man’s switch to be activated in the event of Assange’s death. But he’s definitely alive? Well, he might be. After hearing about this, someone on Twitter wrote: “Don’t trust unconfirmed reports of Assange being alive. The Clinton machine is capable of body doubles. ARREST PAMELA ANDERSON NOW #MAGA. ” So who knows? Wait, Hillary Clinton is in on this, too? No. God, I hate 2016 so much. Has Anderson actually said anything about this? Yes, after the visit she said: “I really believe in him and think he’s a good person, and I’m concerned about his health, his family, and I just hope that by some miracle he’s set free. ” And she tried to fix his ailing health with a vegan sandwich? An unpoisoned vegan sandwich, remember. There’s a big distinction. Was she in the UK just to meet Assange? No, she also delivered a lecture to the Oxford Union about the dangers of porn addiction. Oh wow, that sounds interesting. Sorry, I’m too busy talking about the bigger story  —   you know, how she bought a sandwich for a man and he didn’t immediately die from it. Do say: “The news is out of control. ” Don’t say: Thanks for lunch, Pammy. What’s with the skull and crossbones on the packaging?

‘Voting for a racist’: Trump enters key debate fresh from pivot that wasn’t
From the moment in May when Donald Trump all but sealed the Republican presidential nomination, he has been faced with a nagging question: when will he pivot? When would a new Trump emerge  —   a candidate able to appeal to more than the angry base who propelled him to primary victory over much more seasoned politicians? In the Republican establishment, the wait for the pivot began after Trump forced his remaining opponents out of the race, in Indiana four months ago. It continued through the convention in Cleveland in July. Once he had been formally nominated, the thinking went, maybe then the pivot would come. It didn’t. On Monday, the first presidential debate against Hillary Clinton takes place, at Hofstra University in New York. As Trump prepares to face the largest audience of the cycle thus far, the fabled pivot is nowhere in sight.  Urged by those who reluctantly embraced him to tone down his rhetoric, Trump has in recent weeks attempted to show he is capable of discipline. After doing without teleprompters for much of the primary, he turned to reading from scripts written by advisers brought in to save a sinking campaign. He also embarked on an “outreach” effort aimed at some minority communities, suddenly incorporating into his stump speech lines about the plight of African American voters. But Trump’s platform, his slate of signature policies, chief among them his   line on immigration, has remained exactly the same. And at the debate, some opposed to Trump worry, such details may be lost. Behind a podium, on primetime TV, appearance and style, not policy, often dictate who wins and who loses. “The fact that his base, even his ardent white nationalist supporters, are not complaining about his message pivots is a clear sign that his policies remain substantively the same,” said Frank Sharry, executive director of the immigration reform advocacy group America’s Voice. On immigration, Sharry said, Trump hinted for weeks at a “softening”  —   and secured commensurate media coverage. Then he delivered a speech in Phoenix that “doubled down on his radical proposals” such as deporting the roughly 11 million undocumented migrants who live in America today. “That’s not a policy pivot, it’s a Kellyanne   messaging pivot,” Sharry said, referring to the Republican pollster hired in August as Trump’s campaign manager. “The idea was to make it sound like he was ‘softening’ in hopes of bringing home suburban voters, mostly women, who are uncomfortable voting for a racist. ” A similar tactic was employed regarding Trump’s proposal to ban all Muslim immigration, which was widely criticized even among Republican elected officials. Trump rebranded the plan as “extreme vetting” rooted in an ideological test, but when asked directly plainly denied he was walking back the Muslim ban and said he was in fact strengthening it. Last week, Donald Trump Jr once more revealed the campaign’s thinking, tweeting a photo of a bowl of Skittles as a metaphor for refugees from Syria. If a few were poisoned and could kill you, he asked, would you want any at all? Trump’s first television ad, released last month, depicted immigrants streaming across the border. The commercial claimed that under a Clinton presidency, “Syrian refugees flood in. Illegal immigrants convicted of committing crime get to stay  —   collecting social security benefits, skipping the line. ” Rick Wilson, a Republican strategist and leader of the Never Trump movement, made a similar assessment to Sharry’s. If there had been any strategic change from the Trump campaign, he said, it was only done to find ways for the nominee to mollify undecided voters uncomfortable with his comments about Latinos, Muslims and other demographics. “There’s been no real pivot on immigration and there’s been no real pivot that he has any desire to communicate with Hispanic voters,” said Wilson, who also cited Trump’s efforts to discuss the concerns of black voters. “Donald Trump can give a hot damn about African Americans, but he comes out and says, ‘I want to help inner cities,’” he said. “That’s not really about African American voters, but about white suburban voters. ” While Trump has discussed the challenges facing the African American community, he has largely done so in the company of his own supporters or in the comfortable confines of Fox News.  When he did travel to Flint, Michigan, the site of a crisis over water poisoned by lead, Trump praised the executives implicated in the scandal and criticized a black pastor who interrupted him when he made a political speech at a predominantly black church. Last week, Trump made headlines for saying African Americans were in their “worst shape ever” an echo of his claim that black voters have nothing left to lose, because they lack jobs and education and are disproportionately affected by crime, and should therefore vote for him. “He’s a crafty enough salesman and a crafty enough conman to know that he cannot confuse the object with the subject,” said Wilson. There may be no pivot, but the strategy of appearing to make one, to some of the people some of the time, is paying electoral dividends. Despite there being no indication that minority voters will turn out in the Republican’s favor, polling has tightened. In Philadelphia recently, Stacye Mccollum braved the late summer heat to watch Barack Obama stump for Clinton. An African American voter from Manayunk, Pennsylvania, she stood a dozen steps away from the first black president. Trump’s latest   “pivot” had not gone unnoticed. Referencing “the one comment he had made [about how] ‘I don’t understand why African Americans are voting for Democrats, because Democrats haven’t do[ne] you well. You have no job, you’re low poverty” Mccollum said she had taken only one thing away from Trump’s version of outreach. “I found him to be very condescending,” she said.

Push for ban on domestic ivory trade spurs feud at international summit
A resolution to end the domestic trade in ivory has descended into acrimony at a major conservation summit, with a handful of countries, including Japan and South Africa, objecting to the proposed ban. A coalition of countries, including the US, France, Gabon, Kenya and Malawi, spoke in favor of an International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) motion that calls for every country to ban their internal trade of ivory.  However, delegates from Japan, Namibia and South Africa argued that domestic ivory markets should be left open as long as they are regulated. Canada voiced concerns that the ivory ban would affect trade of walrus and narwhal, which are hunted by indigenous people in the country.  South Africa and Namibia even threatened to end their membership of IUCN over the wording of the motion, according to sources at the world conservation congress, which is being held in Hawaii. After two days of deadlocked talks, the resolution will be discussed further on Saturday in a bid to find consensus. The intransigence of some countries has enraged environmental groups that make up the bulk of the IUCN’s   membership, which also includes 217 state and national government agencies.  “It is disappointing that we are now told we have to meet again for a contact group [a negotiating session] since a few members were not pleased with the outcome of previous discussions,” said Sue Lieberman,   of international policy at the Wildlife Conservation Society, a cosponsor of the motion. “There’s truly a crisis for elephants and we need to close the elephant ivory markets. The overwhelming majority of the earlier contact group wanted to close domestic ivory markets. ” Danny Auron, campaign director at Avaaz, similarly expressed frustration. “Every 15 minutes an elephant is slaughtered for its tusks, and at this rate they’ll be gone forever in a few short years,” he said. “If we want this species to survive, governments need to be falling over themselves to strengthen protections, not fighting to water them down. ” While the IUCN does not regulate the ivory trade, it is hoped that a resolution calling for the end of domestic markets will help spur nations to commit to a ban at the Cites convention, held in Johannesburg later this month. It is through the Cites treaty that the international trade in ivory was banned in 1989. John Scanlon,   of Cites, told the Guardian the forthcoming convention “is without doubt one of the most critical meetings of Cites in its   history.  “It is clear that this [IUCN] motion is generating an intense and robust debate amongst the membership of IUCN, with differing views being strongly expressed. ” The IUCN resolution calls on governments around the world to “close their domestic markets for elephant ivory as a matter of urgency”. The motion states that IUCN members are “deeply concerned” by the illegal killing of elephants that threatens the species’ survival, harms national security and undermines sustainable economic development in countries where elephants are found in the wild. Millions of elephants once roamed throughout Africa and from the coast of Persia through India and deep into China. Habitat loss and rampant poaching has drastically reduced this number, with African elephants now being killed at a faster rate than they are reproducing. The first ever   census of Africa’s savannah elephants found that nearly a third were wiped out between 2007 and 2014. Poachers target the animals to supply ivory from their tusks in Asia. Gangs can get $1, 100 per kilogram for ivory in China, which announced last year it would shut down its own domestic market.  Ivory can also be found by buyers in many western countries. A recent report by the NGO Traffic found that the antiques ivory market in the UK appeared to have declined significantly, though there are still thousands of ivory items on sale in London’s markets. Even though the international trade in ivory has been banned for more than 25 years, a flourishing black market has led to the slaughter of elephants, as well as the people charged with protecting them. A separate IUCN motion to protect 30% of the world’s oceans was agreed with little dispute. The resolution, if adopted by countries, would drastically increase the small amount of marine area currently off limits to commercial fishing and drilling. A related motion that supports marine protected areas on the high seas, which are beyond national jurisdiction, also passed.  “These motions will help reverse the tide of habitat destruction, pollution and depletion of the world’s oceans,” said Francine Kershaw, a science fellow with the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Both emphasize the need for more marine protected areas, which are scientifically supported to enhance ocean health and resilience in the face of global warming, ocean acidification and rapidly escalating industrial activities. ”  Dr Lance Morgan, president of the Marine Conservation Institute, also praised the motions. “This is terrific news and will surely create momentum for establishing more marine reserves around the world in coming years,” he said. “We know how to fix the oceans but now we need the political will and public support to make hard decisions before it’s too late. ” More than 80 other resolutions passed with little fuss. They include a call for a ban on gillnet fishing, which threatens the vaquita porpoise in Mexico, and restrictions on the trade of pangolins. Other motions backed the adoption of renewable energy and energy efficiency by countries. Voting was conducted online prior to the IUCN congress.

Bad moms: why messy motherhood is finally being accepted on screen
Better Things opens with its protagonist, Sam Fox, texting at a shopping mall while her    daughter wails by her side. A nearby woman looks on judgmentally. “Do you want to buy her earrings?” retorts the   single mom. “’Cause that’s why she’s crying. ’Cause I won’t buy her earrings. ” Thanks to TV shows such as this and films such as Bad Moms and Bridget Jones’s Baby, a messier view of motherhood is having a moment in pop culture. No longer depicted as a sanctified state in which women don an apron and remove expertly prepared baked goods from the oven, motherhood  —   with its manifest challenges and residual body fluids  —   is increasingly being portrayed as more complex and more real. Sam embodies all those synonyms for “tired” attributed to single   working mothers: fraught, frazzled, overworked. She is a jobbing actor and so is constantly putting herself in a situation in which she has to prove she is good enough. She’s dating  —   but far from glossing over the logistics, as other shows have always done, Better Things offers a candid illustration of what that actually looks like. Sam invites an attractive director she’s working with back for dinner with her family and he is subjected to her teenage daughter’s anecdote about a school friend’s impromptu public defecation and her mother’s latently racist compulsion to acknowledge that the director is black. Needless to say, they don’t hook up. Sam can’t even watch porn without being intruded upon. Yet perhaps the most radical aspect of Better Things is that Sam has motivations and ambitions that have nothing to do with being a parent. And while she is a sometimes imperfect mother, it’s almost incidental she doesn’t particularly characterise herself as such, only acknowledges that she’s a product of her circumstances just doing her damned best. This summer, Bad Moms also railed against polished, prescriptive modes of motherhood. After kicking out her husband for an online affair, Mila Kunis throws down the gauntlet at a   meeting: “I’m done,” she announces, throwing off the weight of expectation. The film tackles an interesting and rarely aired topic:     (“sometimes I fantasise I get into a car accident, not a bad one, but I get injured, so I can stay in the hospital for a couple weeks”). Beholden to four children and an unsupportive husband, she is underslept and undersocialised, with no life to speak of beyond her role as mom.  The message is that the role of mother has extended far beyond keeping one’s children happy and healthy to encompass a host of thankless auxiliary duties (bake sales, extracurricular activities and looking hot while doing them) that it is fundamentally impossible to be a good one. To be a modern mother is to be a bad one, doomed to failure so why not stop trying to meet an impossible standard and instead retain one’s sense of self? Bad Moms points the finger at mothers perceived as perfect, as opposed to a patriarchal and innately sexist socialisation that demands women relinquish their careers, personal lives and humanity to focus squarely on their children.  In the UK there’s Motherland, Sharon Horgan and Graham Linehan’s sitcom about   motherhood and all of the appearance maintenance that comes with it. “Why don’t we have a nanny?” her husband asks, to which she responds: “Because I want to be raised the way I was, by my mother,” and not “because we are not Sheryl Sandberg and David Goldberg” which gives you an idea of the stakes here. When Julie is pitted against a gang of   “alpha mums” the alphas pour scorn over her for working. “Don’t you hate yourself?” they inquire. Julie finds an ally, whose    is denoted by the fact she doesn’t have herbal tea, in Liz. Single and working class, Liz is reviled by the other mothers, who are both terrified she will steal their husbands and discomfited because she doesn’t fit their prescriptive mold of parenting. Motherland aligns our notions of idealised parenthood with wealth, revealing the heinous classism innate to it. Why are fetishised symbols of   liberalism (organic food, extracurricular activities) fundamental to good parenting? What does that mean if you cannot afford it? The mothers who are flawed here are the seemingly perfect ones. Bridget Jones is perhaps the most renowned modern emblem   femininity in Bridget Jones’s Baby, she is struggling to identify the paternity of her unborn child. Though Bridget Jones puts the traditionally maligned female narrative front and centre, her “imperfections” still rest heavily on a few attributes: she is not teetotal, enjoys sex and is slightly heavier than most female actors in films. The Bridget Jones series has always been about wish fulfillment, later deconstructing the fairytale, usually to get content for the sequel. Pregnant at 43, Bridget wonders: “This might be the only chance I get,” noting that she “always imagined myself in OK! Magazine with the man of my dreams”. Bridget has always outsourced her happiness, previously to partners and romantic interests, now to her baby and the childlike notion of the happy ending. Like getting together with Colin Firth, having the baby you’ve always dreamed of doesn’t guarantee personal contentment. We take responsibility for our own happiness, mothers or not. And as the credits roll, we can’t help but wonder whether we’ll meet her again as we did at the beginning: crying on the sofa.  Perhaps the most viscerally frazzled mother to grace our screens in very recent memory is Winona Ryder’s Joyce in Stranger Things. While being drawn and overwrought in the wake of her son being abducted by an unknown paranormal entity is largely expected, there is much to imply she was every bit as nervy,   and chaotic    —   mostly because she’s left raising two teenage boys without any support, financial or otherwise, from their deadbeat dad. Uncomfortably, the end seems to imply she gets it together having come to appreciate what she might have lost (her child) serving up an idyllically   meal, despite having no obvious additional support or income. Throughout Better Things there are flashbacks to the person who we assume is the father of Sam’s children. In one, we see him wake up one of her children to tell them about what sounds like a spurious career opportunity. “I’ve got irons in the fire!” he says. “Don’t tell your mother I woke you. ” Later in the same episode, as she struggles to get through the mountainous list of shit that just needs to get done  —   taking out the trash, cooking dinner for her family, making sure her daughters haven’t gone to sleep without brushing their teeth  —   it becomes apparent. Are these mothers struggling only because of inadequate fathers?

Planned Parenthood: eight states now striving to repeal abortion restrictions
Efforts are brewing in at least eight states to repeal abortion restrictions that appear to be unconstitutional after a major supreme court victory for abortion rights advocates. That is according to Planned Parenthood officials, who vowed on Thursday to support these efforts and any others that take advantage of Monday’s monumental decision. Planned Parenthood made the announcement the same day that Donald Trump, the GOP’s presumptive presidential nominee, broke a puzzling   silence on the ruling, known as Whole Woman’s Health v Hellerstedt. Speaking to conservative radio host Mike Gallagher, Trump echoed a promise to appoint supreme court justices who oppose abortion rights. “If we had Scalia was living or Scalia had been replaced by me, you wouldn’t have had that, OK?” he said. The decision was   suggesting the outcome would have been the same with Scalia’s vote or a conservative replacement. The court’s ruling on Monday struck down a Texas law that closed half the state’s abortion clinics by requiring all clinics to meet expensive,   standards, and all providers to have   privileges with a local hospital. In its ruling, the court found no evidence that the law made abortion safer, as its supporters claimed, and served only to make abortions harder to obtain. The law, said the majority, was therefore unconstitutional. Since the ruling was announced, calls at the state level to overturn similar restrictions spread like wildfire, Planned Parenthood officials said. Lawmakers are formulating specific plans to target similar abortion restrictions in Arizona, Pennsylvania and Virginia, and they are broadly prepared to repeal laws in Florida, Michigan and Texas. In Tennessee, Planned Parenthood is looking to support litigation by the Center for Reproductive Rights against that state’s building requirement law. They will also target Missouri’s admitting privileges law. Earlier this week, officials with Planned Parenthood of Kansas and   signaled that they were prepared, if necessary, to mount a legal challenge. “This list is not final,” Dawn Laguens, Planned Parenthood’s executive   said on a call with reporters. Efforts to repeal harsh restrictions are sure to be met with solid resistance as long as the same lawmakers who passed the abortion restrictions still hold power. Republican lawmakers were overwhelmingly responsible for the abortion restrictions under fire, and in each of these states, the party still controls at least one house of the legislature, if not also the governor’s seat. Asked how successful a legislative campaign would be under those circumstances, officials with Planned Parenthood said they were confident that these efforts had “momentum”. “We might not win everything on the first day,” said Laguens. “We don’t think for one minute that people who have spent the last decade trying to take away women’s access to abortion   …     are all of a sudden going to see the light   …     But ‘by all means necessary’ really, is our strategy. ” Laguens suggested that raising the profile of these statehouse battles might also energize voters around November’s elections. “I think it’s a good idea for them to have a legislative strategy,” said Priscilla Smith, a professor at Yale Law School who has litigated abortion restrictions. Since a Republican takeover of many state legislatures kicked off a wave of abortion restrictions, she said, “The   movement has relied too heavily on litigation alone, and has not focused enough on legislation. ”   lawmakers will never support these efforts, Smith continued, but moderate lawmakers might be swayed. “It’s a waste of state resources to enforce these laws in court   …     The same argument can be made to a legislature. It’s an appeal to reason and   as much as it’s an appeal to   lawmakers. ” The laws being targeted have shuttered at least a dozen abortion clinics in a region already hurting for abortion access. In Missouri, a law that requires abortion providers to have   privileges with a local hospital has left the state with just one working abortion clinic, in St Louis. A Planned Parenthood clinic in Columbia, Missouri, is licensed to offer abortions. But it was forced to stop providing the procedure after the University of Missouri, apparently under political pressure, suspended the clinic’s privileges at the university hospital. Chris Koster, the state’s Democratic attorney general has already questioned the constitutionality of the admitting privileges law in response to Monday’s ruling. Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Virginia all require most abortion clinics to meet   building requirements. Those laws forced seven abortion clinics in Virginia alone to shut down, said Helene Krasnoff, the Planned Parenthood’s director of public policy litigation. At least another ten have closed in Arizona and Michigan. Some abortion restrictions have already been toppled by Monday’s ruling  —   no legislation required. These were states with ongoing litigation against abortion restrictions. Immediately after the ruling, Alabama attorney general Luther Strange announced that he was dropping the state’s defense of its admitting privilege law. The law would have forced four out of five Alabama abortion clinics to close. On Tuesday, the supreme court declined to hear a final appeal of Wisconsin’s admitting privilege law, effectively striking that law down for good. The restrictions Planned Parenthood and its allies are targeting are measures that are harder to challenge in court. Some of the laws have been on the books for many years, meaning the only abortion clinics left are in compliance. It is unclear, in those cases, if the clinics would have standing to bring a legal challenge. On Thursday, a federal judge blocked another state abortion restriction, although not as a direct result of Whole Woman’s Health v Hellerstedt. District judge Tanya Walton Pratt blocked an Indiana law which barred abortions when the reason was “race, color, national origin, ancestry, sex or a diagnosis or potential diagnosis” of a disability or malformation.

’Trust can be restored’: Icelanders on their parliamentary election
Halldora was born and raised in Iceland and currently works in Reykjavik. She feels people have finally had enough of the current government’s lack of transparency. “I’ve joined in the protests at Austurvöllur, the square in front of the Parliament, many times during these last three and a half years this government’s been in power. The mood current mood is kind of   ‘We’ve had enough! ’” In spite of the protests, Halldora believes many voters have not yet decided which party to vote for. “The only thing people know is that they’re not voting for the parties in power, because nothing will ever change with them in charge. ” She hopes that the election result will give a chance for a more   coalition to take charge. “The polls are showing that as many as four opposition parties can join forces after the election. I think it can work. Some of the parties really want to change things and have more transparency in the system as a whole. I’m hoping for a real change this time. ”  Baldur Sigurðsson is a mathematician who grew up in the cities of Kópavogur and Hafnarfjörður. He’s looking forward to political change after the parliamentary election, confident that people have had enough of the parties currently in power. “Since this government came in in 2013, there’s been a lot of active resentment against it. Although it was no small drop of news, the Panama Papers scandal was the thing that pushed it over the edge. I’m personally hoping to see the Pirate Party, left greens, social democrats and bright future form a government. I think trust can be restored in Iceland if the right people get in. ” As a high school student in Reykjavik this will be the first time Kjartan Skarphéðinsson has had a chance to vote in an election. But having three family members involved in three different political parties, he’s always been very interested in Icelandic politics. “Most people I know are excited about the election. There have been plenty of conversations recently that eventually turn to the election and who people are planning to vote for. We’ll hopefully get a lot of new blood in and get rid of the current government. ”  While the radical Pirate Party looks set to have a good election, Kjartan is still cautious about writing off the parties currently in power, despite the Panama Paper revelations and accusations of cronyism. “I think people who have traditionally voted for the parties in power are apathetic. They know about the corruption going on but still see the current government as a better alternative than the inexperienced Pirate Party or the traditionally disliked establishment   parties that lead during the recession and thus had to make some large cuts. There is also a big difference between the voting demographics in the countryside and the cities. ” Galdur was born and raised in Iceland and works as an IT professional. He has seldom seen a more indecisive mood in the country ahead of an election: “I’m not sure who I’m voting for yet, but it will definitely be an opposition party. The ruling parties have both been implicated in the Panama Papers and that has tainted their integrity and people’s trust towards them. Their poor results in the   polls, despite an upturn in our economy, aren’t surprising. ”  Despite the uncertainty among people, Galdur believes the media coverage leading up to the election has been excellent. “I think RÚV, the state TV station, and other outlets are doing a good job providing all the parties with air time and giving them a fair chance to present their case to the public. ” Whoever wins the parliamentary election, Galdur is clear about what he wants to see from a new government. “The tax system needs to be fairer   the highest earners having to contribute more. There needs to be more funds channeled into our health system and also towards improving our roads and tourist attractions. Above all, the blatant cronyism needs to stop   the appointment of friends and relatives, allowing the sale of high profit companies and properties to friends and family, lowering taxes for the rich while putting higher burdens on the low and middle classes. It all needs to stop. We need more integrity. ” Axel works for the government and is predicting real change after Saturday’s election. “The four establishment parties are facing their worst electoral outcomes ever. We have three new parties that could grab as much as 40% of the vote. There is a fairly strong sentiment among voters to show their dissatisfaction with the political establishment. This sentiment is far stronger now than in the wake of the economic crash back in 2008. ”  With the current coalition partners, the Independence Party and the Progressive Party, not going to win enough seats to continue in government, Axel thinks other parties will get a chance to form a coalition. “Icelandic politicians needs to distance themselves entirely from special interests and convince their voters that they are first and foremost focused on the public’s interest. Politicians also need to introduce more transparency at all levels of government. Increased opportunities for the public to exert a greater political influence will empower the people and make them feel like they can rein in the politicians. ” Runar was born and raised in the village of Seydisfjordur on Iceland’s east coast. He works as a team leader in the local fish processing plant. “The fishing industry is still strong, but there’s some uncertainty about what will happen after the election. The rightwing politicians want to keep the industry more or less the same, but the parties on the left want to make radical changes. Some of the biggest companies in fishing are benefactors of the Independence party. ”  Runar hopes there will be a political change that can benefit both his own industry and regain people’s trust in the country’s politicians. “I don’t think there’s apathy towards politics in Iceland. You can’t turn on the radio or TV without being bombarded by election news. People seem to be interested, but I suppose the turnout will show us how interested they really are. There is a certain level of animosity towards the politicians that were found out to be involved in the Panama Papers scandal. People are not happy to be in financial quarantine themselves, while at the same time observing politicians stashing money offshore. Whoever is elected also needs to look at a health system that is in tatters and ensure that everyone has equal access to it. ” Matt currently works in the Icelandic public sector and lives in Reykjavik. “The mood in Iceland is interesting. It’s been a much shorter campaign cycle this time round than last time in April 2013, mostly because everyone knew those elections were coming well in advance. ” Matt believes there’s plenty of interest among the public and that the coverage of the elections has gone far to ignite this. “There’s been regular television debates, often with anything up to ten or 12 participants, and regular opinion polls dominating the front pages. The mood is not one of apathy, but I would say there are a lot of people still undecided where their vote will go. ”  Matt believes there are different outcomes that can realistically happen once the votes have been counted. “The Pirate Party might get a shot at governing, people might stick with whom they know and ignore the recent scandals, or another party altogether might have a late surge of support. A   coalition looks simply unworkable. I don’t see how they could all work in government or in coalition. The best option would be a government of just the three with the most seats. I would reckon that will be Pirates, Left Greens and either Social Democrats or Bright Future. ”  Whichever way the vote goes Matt echoes other people’s feelings about the cronyism in Icelandic politics. “Polticians need to show a bit more humility, show respect to the office they hold and the trust the people have given them. Just this week we’ve had reports of both the Foreign Minister and the Agriculture and Fisheries Minister appointing their advisors to the boards of public bodies. It’s this sort of cronyism that pollutes our politics. ”

Clinton endorsed by New York Times as Warren says Trump is ’making hate OK’
As Hillary Clinton prepared for the first presidential debate against Donald Trump on Monday, campaign surrogates spoke in swing states and the New York Times published a strongly worded endorsement of the former secretary of state. The Times’ editorial board said that as first lady, senator for New York and secretary of state, Clinton had shown herself to be “one of the most tenacious politicians of her generation” capable of fostering bipartisan cooperation. It also called Trump “the worst nominee put forward by a major party in modern American history”. In New Hampshire, where, according to the Real Clear Politics average, Clinton holds a 44% to 38% lead, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren accused Trump and the Republican party of “making hate OK”. In Ohio, where Trump leads by 45% to 42% cast members from the 1990s TV show The West Wing, which portrayed an imaginary Democratic administration, hit the stump for Clinton. Echoing concerns among Democrats about motivating voters, particularly the young, to vote for a candidate who has struggled to generate campaign momentum, the Times’ editorial board argued that Trump’s negative qualities were not enough to merit an endorsement of Clinton.  “Running down the other guy won’t suffice,” wrote the board, which is separate from the newsroom. “The best case for Hillary Clinton cannot be, and is not, that she isn’t Donald Trump. The best case is, instead, about the challenges this country faces, and Mrs Clinton’s capacity to rise to them. “A lifetime’s commitment to solving problems in the real world qualifies Hillary Clinton for this job, and the country should put her to work,” the editorial board added. Addressing Clinton’s poor poll ratings regarding trust and favourability, it said: “Mrs Clinton’s occasional missteps, combined with attacks on her trustworthiness, have distorted perceptions of her character.  “She is one of the most tenacious politicians of her generation, whose willingness to study and correct course is rare in an age of unyielding partisanship. ” Grouping as examples the rise of Trump, the Brexit vote for Britain to leave the European Union, the spread of Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria and the resurgence of Russia under Vladimir Putin, the Times said the next president would take office “with bigoted, tribalist movements and their leaders on the march”. It added: “War, terrorism and the pressures of globalization are eroding democratic values, fraying alliances and challenging the ideals of tolerance and charity. ”  Regarding the candidate’s   battles with the press over her use of a private email server while secretary of state, which flared up again on Friday with the release of FBI notes and the news a judge had ruled some such emails must be released to the public before election day, the Times said: “That decision deserved scrutiny, and it’s had it.  “Now, considered alongside the real challenges that will occupy the next president, that email server, which has consumed so much of this campaign, looks like a matter for the help desk.  “And, viewed against those challenges, Mr Trump shrinks to his true     proportions, as we’ll argue in detail on Monday. ” The paper promised a scathing perspective on Trump for Monday, saying he is “the worst nominee put forward by a major party in modern American history”. In a preview, the Times said the Republican candidate “discloses nothing concrete about himself or his plans while promising the moon and offering the stars on layaway”.  On the campaign trail in Nashua, Warren spoke to volunteers at a Clinton campaign office. “We’re here to say hate is not OK,” she said. “We build a stronger America together  —   that’s what this is about. ” Warren was scheduled to make three stops in the state, where a Senate contest between incumbent Republican Kelly Ayotte and Democratic governor Maggie Hassan remains close. Warren sought to tie Ayotte to Trump  —   the senator has said she would “stand up” to Trump but nonetheless vote for him  —   saying she had not thought a major presidential candidate would base a campaign on scapegoating Mexicans, women and Muslims. “What Donald Trump is doing is not what any of us thought a man who’s running for president would do,” she said. “He’s found something much uglier that he wants to make the basis of his campaign. ” Warren was also critical of the   Texas senator Ted Cruz, who on Friday said he would vote for Trump despite having denounced him, while they were primary rivals, for Trump’s personal attacks against the senator’s wife and father.  In July, Cruz refused to endorse Trump in a speech to the Republican convention, earning boos, then explained his speech by saying he was not a “servile puppy”. Explaining his decision in a statement posted to Facebook on Friday, Cruz said: “Even though I have had areas of significant disagreement with our nominee, by any measure Hillary Clinton is wholly unacceptable. ” On Saturday, Warren asked: “Is that really what your word is worth, Ted Cruz?”

Ignore the naysayers. America can handle 110,000 more refugees
Barack Obama’s announcement that the United States proposes to admit 110, 000 refugees over the course of the next year has elicited a furious reaction from some Republican leaders. This was predictable. A spirit of xenophobia has once again taken hold in the United States, as has happened on several previous occasions in American history. As early as 1798, just a few years after the establishment of the Republic, Congress adopted a Naturalization law that was intended to keep out radicals who could promote sedition. The main targets were the French, who might spread the “Jacobin” ideology of the French Revolution. In the 19th century, a focus of exclusion was the Chinese who were explicitly kept out under the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. That law was not repealed until 1943, when it became embarrassing because China was an ally of the United States in the war against Japan. In the early part of the 20th century, a number of measures were adopted to limit the admission of southern Europeans, such as the Italians, ostensibly because they were thought to be more likely to spread the anarchist ideology than   immigrants from northern Europe. And so things have gone. Today, of course, the main focus of those denouncing Obama’s proposal is Syrian refugees. Up to now, the United States has admitted a few more than 10, 000. So far, at least, their resettlement in the United States has seemed to go very well, though Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Donald Trump’s running mate, has tried to keep them out of his state. Additional refugees from Syria would constitute a minority of those that Obama proposes to admit over the next year. The number projected for all countries in the Middle East and South Asia is 40, 000. Yet in this election year, in which the Republican nominee for president swept aside his opponents for the nomination by saying he would deport 11 million undocumented immigrants from Mexico, and he would bar all Muslims from entering the United States, has made xenophobia look like a winning political strategy. As should be apparent, a wealthy country of 320 million people can easily absorb 110, 000 refugees. In the year that ends 30 September, America’s goal has been 85, 000 refugees. The increase is modest given the scale of the global refugee crisis. It compares poorly to neighboring Canada, with a population just over ten percent of the United States.  In the brief period between 15 November 2015 and 29 February 2016, Canada admitted 25, 000 Syrian refugees, as well as many refugees from other countries. As Canada’s highly popular Prime Minister Justin Trudeau does not have political opponents trying to win office by exploiting xenophobia, the absorption of the Syrian refugees has been accepted not only approvingly but enthusiastically by the great majority of Canadians. A large number of the refugees have been sponsored by Canadian church groups,   associations and other   organizations that have paid the initial costs of resettlement, and helped the refugees to find homes, learn English, get jobs and get their children into schools.  Canada carefully screens refugees accepted for resettlement. So does the United States. Typically, the American screening program for refugees lasts more than a year. That is possible when an orderly program is established. It is one of the reasons that a refugee program such as that conducted by Canada, and the one under which the United States admitted 10, 000 Syrian refugees in the past year, tends to succeed.  I don’t think Americans are inherently more xenophobic than their Canadian neighbors. In such matters, as in much else, political opportunism plays a big role. It seems to bring out the worst in many people, including those denouncing the president’s modest proposal.

Golden State Warriors beat Oklahoma City Thunder to return to NBA finals
The Golden State Warriors came from behind to topple the Oklahoma City Thunder   in Monday’s Game 7 of the Western Conference finals, completing a rally from a   series deficit to seal a place in the NBA finals for the second year in a row. Stephen Curry scored a   36 points to spark the Warriors, who trailed by as many as 13 during the first half but used a   run in the third quarter to open an   lead entering the fourth. His Golden State   Klay Thompson added 21 points and six   to follow up his   performance in Game 6 on Saturday, when the Warriors needed a furious rally to force Monday’s    finale. Golden State become the 10th team in NBA history to rally from a     deficit in   postseason series and win it. “This may be the greatest team in the history of the NBA,” Thunder coach Billy Donovan said afterward. “They do things like make big shots and do some of those things. We were right there every step of the way with them, and this was a   team and world champions. We’ve got to give them credit. ” The series outcome evoked the    expression: were the Warriors the only team good enough to pull off such a comeback  —   or were the Thunder the only team combustable enough to lose from such a winning position? It might be that it was a little bit of both. The history was not in the Thunder’s favor.   teams were   in home Game 7s, according to ESPN. There have been 36 teams to lose Game 6 at home with a   series lead. Of those, less than half came back to win Game 7. But more than that, Russell Westbrook was off his game, shooting for    from the floor on Monday night. Kevin Durant shot    for a total of 27 points, his   Game 7 performance ever. “We laid it all out there,” a somber Durant said. “Everybody left their soul out on the court. We have no regrets. ” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said beforehand he was going to make “11 alterations to the gameplan” one of which was starting Andre Iguodala after a strong showing in Game 6 instead of Harrison Barnes. Iguodala added seven points and was aggressive on defense. Saturday’s Game 6 appeared to be the beginning of the end for the Thunder’s charmed postseason as Oklahoma City blew yet another lead in the fourth quarter. The Thunder were notorious for squandering leads in the final minutes of   games. At one point their number of   collapses were worse than the Philadelphia 76ers, one of the worst teams in the league this year. There is also plenty of speculation about the future of Durant, who will soon be a free agent. A player of his talents could easily make over $100m on a new contract. But Durant, understandably, did not want to discuss such matters on Monday night. “I mean, we just lost like 30 minutes ago, so I haven’t even thought about it,” Durant said. “I’m just embracing my   and just reflecting on the season. I’ll think about that stuff, I don’t know when. But we just lost an hour ago, 30 minutes ago, so I don’t know. ” Bay Area natives Andy Samberg and   were seen in the Oracle Arena crowd, as was Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who arrived at   after campaigning in northern California. Now the Cleveland Cavaliers will head to California for a much anticipated rematch of last year’s NBA finals, which the Warriors won in six games. Game 1 is Thursday in Oakland.

Babies breastfed within an hour of birth are less likely to die. Yet only 50% are
What happens in an hour can make all the difference. When I had my first baby, the support I received from my nurse was indispensable in helping me initiate and continue breastfeeding. It may not be obvious, but putting newborns to the breast within the first hour of life can make the difference between life and death. Delaying the start of breastfeeding beyond one hour after birth can raise a newborns risk of dying by 80% compared to those who are breastfed immediately. Newborns now account for nearly half of all deaths of children under five. Early breastfeeding plays a critical part in reducing newborn mortality and keeping babies healthy. But are we doing everything possible to make that happen?  It turns out we’re not. New research from Unicef shows that more than half of all newborns are not breastfed within one hour of birth. That means that 77 million newborns  —   over 50% of babies born each year   are losing out on the benefits of early initiation, exposing them to a higher risk of disease and death. This is happening because women are not getting the support they need around the time of birth, even when a doctor, nurse or midwife is assisting their delivery. Globally, more than three quarters of all mothers give birth with the help of a skilled birth attendant. But in many hospitals, rather than initiating the practice of breastfeeding by immediately placing a newborn on the mother’s chest,   attendants will take the baby away to give the mother time to rest or feed the newborn formula. In the Middle East, North Africa and in South Asia, women who deliver with a skilled birth attendant are less likely to initiate breastfeeding in the first hour of life, compared to women who deliver with unskilled attendants or relatives. When babies are given alternatives to breastmilk, they breastfeed less often, making it harder for mothers to start and continue breastfeeding. In some countries, the rise in caesarean deliveries has reduced this crucial practice and delayed breastfeeding initiation however, with the right support, even most newborns delivered by Caesarean section can be put to the breast within the first hour of life. Traditional practices also interfere with getting an early start to breastfeeding, depriving newborns of the essential nutrients, antibodies and    contact with their mother that protect them from disease and death. In India, some women are taught to discard colostrum —  the   breast milk a mother produces right after birth. In Nigeria, some newborns are given water or tea in lieu of breast milk, putting them at risk of diarrhea and malnutrition. Countries in other parts of the world are inundated with formula marketing, which has led to plummeting breastfeeding rates.  Placing newborns on their mother’s bare chest  —   known as    contact  —   immediately after birth helps reduce mortality by regulating a baby’s heart rate, temperature and breathing, while also facilitating breastfeeding. Not only that, exposure to the bacteria on the mother’s breast helps to colonize a newborn’s digestive system with essential antibodies. Immediate    contact promotes bonding between newborn and mother and ensures that babies receive the nurturing they need from the very first moments they enter the world.  And mothers practicing early    contact and early initiation of breastfeeding with their newborns are more likely to produce sufficient milk, breastfeed within the first months of their baby’s life, and continue breastfeeding longer  —   a practice proven to improve health outcomes for both children and mothers. The Lancet reported earlier this year that breastfeeding exclusively for the first six months could save more than 800, 000 children’s lives each year because it acts as a baby’s first vaccine, protecting infants from diseases, and giving them a perfectly adapted nutritional supply they need at each developmental stage. This amounts to a 13% reduction in the deaths of children under five and also supports healthy brain development, increased IQ scores and better school performance for all children. Breastfeeding is a powerful intervention  —   it’s   backed by research and doesn’t require preparation or expensive new medications. Breastfeeding has incredible developmental benefits, and, in areas that lack access to clean environment and clean water to mix with formula powder, saves babies from   diseases such as diarrhea and pneumonia. To be sure, there are many barriers to breastfeeding we must work to overcome so mothers who want to breastfeed are able to, and there are a small number of mothers for whom breastfeeding isn’t an option. But to serve millions of mothers and children better, one simple and important thing we can do now is support early initiation of breastfeeding. Providing new mothers with guidance on initiating breastfeeding, not supplying any liquids or foods other than breastmilk and ensuring that staff are appropriately trained are all simple adjustments that can help a woman breastfeed successfully.  Given what research has taught us about the importance of early initiation, we have countless reasons to do everything possible to increase rates globally  —   especially when solutions come at little to no extra cost.

Pokémon Go: five tricks for pro players that are almost as good as cheats
Once you’ve mastered the basics of Pokémon Go, advanced to curve balls and tried your luck in gyms, it’s time to turn it up a notch and start exploiting the game to boost your chances of being a champion. There’s nothing illegal about these tips, but some may find them unsporting. Others rely on them to get an edge over their competitors. Here are five tips to help give you a boost. Increasing the level of your trainer is crucial to get access to both higher level Pokémon and the tools to catch them. Above level 20 you gain access to Ultra balls, which make life a lot easier when trying to keep hold of the rarer beasts. Levelling up can be a bit of a slow grind, but Pidgey stacking can boost your trainer by at least one level. It’s pretty simple. All you need are lots of Pidgey and a lucky egg. Low powered Pidgey are plentiful in most places and require only 12 candies to evolve into Pidgeotto, an act that normally gives you 500XP. With a lucky egg active, which doubles your XP for 30 minutes that becomes 1, 000XP per evolution. By collecting loads of them and evolving as many as possible in 30 minutes with a lucky egg you can set somewhere in the region of 30, 000 to 40, 000XP at full burn with a strong internet connection. At lower levels that’s enough to jump at least one, possibly two levels. After you’re done with all the Pidgey, just trade in the resulting Pidgeotto to start collecting candies to do it again. You can use any Pokémon that can evolve, of course, but Pidgey is the most candy efficient given its abundance. Not all Pokémon are created equally, that much is obvious. But what you might not know is that two Pokémon of the same type and level are also not equal. Each monster has a series of hidden values that dictate how much HP and CP it has per level, as well as its secret energy rating, which determines how long it takes for the special attack energy bar to fill up. These   individual values (IVs) cannot be directly interrogated, but using some calculations based on the health and power of a particular Pokémon for its given level, you can infer them. By doing so you can work out which Pokémon are worth spending time improving using stardust and evolution candy and which are not. When you get to a high level with your trainer, these IVs can make around a  % in both HP and CP, which when your Pokémon are maxed out, could mean the difference between beating rivals and losing battles in the gym. There are several ways to use IVs, with the simplest being to compare Pokémon of a same type and similar level to see which has the higher CP and HP values. But for those that want to take it further, an IV calculator is required. The best is arguably that created by Reddit Pokémon Go community, the Silph Road, which has been conducting research into various attributes of Pokémon Go. The IV rater allows you to quickly estimate how good your Pokémon can be, and whether it is worth hanging on to, simply by moving some sliders. There are others, including an IV calculator app for Android, although they may or may not be accurate they are worth using if you’re serious about trying to take over and hold gyms as you reach the highest trainer levels. One of the more powerful and easier to get Pokémon in the game are the evolved forms of Eevee, but unlike most other beasts in the game, Eevee has three different evolved forms in Pokémon Go. Eevee can become the   Flareon, the   Jolteon or the   Vaporeon. They’re all solid in their own ways, with some being more effective in certain situations than others. But the most powerful for both attack and defence of the lot is Vaporeon. To choose, rather than have Eevee randomly evolve into one of them, you have to rename your Eevee after one of the Eevee brothers from the Pokémon TV show before evolving it. Calling it Pyro spawns a Flareon, while Sparky becomes a Jolteon and Rainer a Vaporeon. Rename Eevee, hit save and then reload the Pokémon Go app just to make sure the name saved. Then evolve the renamed Eevee to net yourself your desired Pokémon. This should work at least once, but your milage may vary. Make sure you check out the IVs of the Eevee you’re planning to evolve to make sure you’ve got a   one before using all your candy. Hatching eggs is one of the best ways to get powerful Pokémon, but if you don’t walk for your commute or in your general day, it can be hard to clock up the kilometres required to incubate them. You might find, however, that if you leave your smartphone plugged in and on a desk, that your location wanders around, enough to add up to half a kilometre a day to your walking total in my testing depending on how accurate the smartphone can put your location. Every little helps, particularly if you don’t have a drone to hand. Once you’ve caught your 100th Pidgey, unless you’re Pidgey stacking, you’re probably after some of the more rare Pokémon. You could aimlessly wander the streets or rely on word of mouth, but if you’re less keen on clocking up the kilometres, there’s a better way. Various maps or radar apps have popped up that promise to show where Pokémon are and for how long at any given moment. Having tested Pokévision, I’ve found it accurate on over 10 occasions for various Pokémon. Putting in your location and searching will bring up all the Pokémon around you, but you can narrow down your search to specific Pokémon and search a much wider area. You still have to put the leg work into getting there before the timer runs out, but Pokévision, and others like it, should help take the guess work out of catching the less common varieties of Pokémon.

For Donald Trump, this was more than a terrible week. It was a turning point
What have you accomplished this week? Whatever it is, you don’t come close to Donald Trump. Trump has demolished his campaign, his brand and his party. He has squandered his   pick and his convention, and several battleground states along with them. He picked several fights he could not win, and showed no sign of learning from his own failure. It would be tempting to say this was just another week in the bizarre life of the Republican presidential nominee. But it wasn’t. This week was a decisive turning point in the 2016 election, and there have been remarkably few of them in an campaign that is supposedly volatile.  In fact, the volatility and unpredictability of this election doesn’t come from polls or votes, but from the character of a single man: Donald J Trump. The real surprise of 2016 is how constant this contest has been.  Trump led the primary polls from the beginning and never lost his lead. He only surprised the chattering classes by defying their certainty that he would lose. That certainty was founded on nothing related to polling data, but rather their sheer disgust and disbelief with Trump’s politics. Having defied expectations once, Trump is now supposed to be able to defy polling gravity forever more. That would be a strange conclusion to draw from the primaries, but here we are.  Echoing the Trump campaign, the Fox News anchor Greta van Susteren distilled this position on Thursday, as she quizzed the   Karl Rove. “I see the rallies and they’re big, and I see the poll numbers, and he’s slipping in the polls,” she said. “I’m not so sure how accurate these polls are. ”  Rove  —   the man who challenged the Fox News election desk as it called the 2012 election for Obama  —   was incredulous. “You’re assuming first of all, the polls are not reliable  —   all of them  —   and second of all, that a better test of this is the size of the crowds he gets at his rallies, which are big and enthusiastic,” he explained. “But I would remind you in the closing days in the 1984 presidential campaign, Walter Mondale was drawing large and enthusiastic rallies as he went on to narrowly win one state. ”  To put it delicately, this is a difficult moment in the education of Donald Trump. For a candidate who leads every stump speech bragging about his poll numbers, there is less and less material every day. Ergo the polls  —   just like the media, Clinton and democracy itself  —   must be crooked.  It would be nice to call this a logical fallacy, but those are two words that should never be placed within physical proximity of Donald J Trump.  “I see some great polls,” he told a rally in Virginia on Tuesday. “I see one from the Los Angeles Times, just came out, where we’re ahead by four or five points. I see one from CNN where we’re down. I think these polls, I don’t know. There’s something about these polls. There’s something phony. ”  That was the day after he told voters there was an even bigger problem with this confounding election. “I’m afraid the election’s going to be rigged,” he told voters in Ohio. “I have to be honest. ”  Those who live in the   world are having an easier time understanding Trump’s challenges. The simpler explanation is that he is losing because of his own performance and personality. As the saying goes, campaigns are like fish: they rot from the head down. This one stinks already and it’s only the start of August. Barack Obama put it more diplomatically at his   press conference. “If Mr Trump is up 10 or 15 points on election day and he ends up losing, then, you know, maybe he can raise some questions,” Obama ventured. “That doesn’t seem to be the case at the moment. ”  No, it doesn’t. In any campaign cycle, there are periods when the dynamic turns decisively in one direction. While the dynamic can shift more than once, as the cycle runs its course there are fewer and fewer opportunities to do so. George HW Bush engineered one of those shifts after his 1988 convention, turning a   deficit into an   lead, backed up by devastating TV ads. Bill Clinton enjoyed one of those shifts in 1992 when Ross Perot initially dropped out of the race, and Clinton never really lost his lead again.  In 2004, John Kerry staged a decent convention and held a narrow lead, but was soon destroyed by a better Republican convention and the   attacks that followed. Four years later, Barack Obama didn’t bury John McCain until the financial collapse that followed both conventions. How does the past week of 2016 compare to those   moments in recent presidential history? Pretty favorably. Trump miserably misjudged his dispute with the gold star parents of a fallen American soldier, Humayun Khan, who was Muslim. He drove a wedge between himself and the few Republican leaders who publicly tolerated his nomination. And he seriously undermined his own brand of patriotic nationalism, as well as his party’s reputation for strength on national security. The lasting impact of Trump’s disastrous week came from its echoes of the Democratic convention. Each round of dispute with the Khan family only served to reinforce the criticism that he had sacrificed nothing. Each   response underscored Hillary Clinton’s attack on his temperament and qualifications to serve as   . In the middle of his own circular firing squad, Trump decided to shoot at the one unifying Republican who has politely ignored his insanity: House speaker Paul Ryan. Trump’s support for Ryan’s primary opponent was  —   like the construction of so many hideous Trump Towers  —   wholly unnecessary. Ryan’s response was to send out a fundraising email assuming Trump had already blown this election. “If we fail to protect our majority in Congress, we could be handing President Hillary Clinton a blank check,” the fundraiser said, echoing the congressional Republican party’s abandonment of Bob Dole in the closing weeks of the 1996 election.  Of course, these aren’t the closing weeks of the 2016 campaign. Trump could yet turn around his national polling deficit of up to 14 points. He could flip the polls in Florida (down four) Michigan (down nine) Pennsylvania (down 13) and New Hampshire (down 15). He could turn Georgia and Utah back into reliably Republican states again, instead of being   states.  But Trump only has one shot left to do that: the TV debates that start in another seven weeks. At the same time, history suggests that   polling is remarkably stable stretching all the way into the final days of an election. It’s going to be a long, hot summer for the orange one.

Dave Mirra had brain trauma disease CTE when he died, doctors say
Dave Mirra, the BMX icon who killed himself in February aged 41, had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the chronic brain disease that has been found in dozens of former NFL players, a University of Toronto doctor has concluded. Several other neuropathologists confirmed the diagnosis, according to ESPN. Mirra is the first BMX rider to be diagnosed with CTE, a disease tied to repeated brain trauma and associated with symptoms such as memory loss, depression and progressive dementia. Mirra was found dead in Greenville, South Carolina on 4 February from a   gunshot wound. The tau protein deposits found in Mirra’s brain were indistinguishable from the kind that have been found in the brains of former football and hockey players with CTE, Dr   Hazrati, the Toronto neuropathologist, told ESPN The Magazine. “I couldn’t tell the difference,” she said. “The trauma itself defines the disease, not how you got the trauma. It’s assumed it is related to multiple concussions that happened years before. ” Mirra, a BMX legend who won numerous X Games gold medals, fractured his skull when a car hit him at age 19, and he tried boxing after his retirement from BMX. But he also endured countless concussions during a glittering career. Many in BMX have shared their concerns over the effects of the concussions most riders have sustained at some point in their career. Hazrati shared her findings on Mirra’s brain with additional US and Canadian neuropathologists. Each confirmed Hazrati’s diagnosis of CTE. “It validates what we have been thinking about brain injuries in boxers and football players,” Hazrati said. “The key is brain injury. Regardless of how you get it, through BMX or hockey, you are at risk for this. ” Mirra’s wife Lauren was told of Mirra’s CTE in March. She told ESPN how she noticed his personality change in the last year of his life. “I started to notice changes in his mood. And then it quickly started to get worse,” she said. “He wasn’t able to be present in any situation or conversation, so it was hard to be in a relationship with him to any degree. He was lost. I looked straight through him on a few occasions. And I was like, ‘Where are you? Where are you? What is wrong?’ “This is the beginning of bringing awareness. It would be amazing if this is something we can detect in life one day. If we can detect it, prevent it, stop it, let’s do all of the above. ” Mirra will be inducted into the National BMX Hall of Fame in Chula Vista, California, on 11 June. He will also be honored during this June’s X Games in Austin, Texas, with a new event named for him, the Dave Mirra BMX Park Best Trick competition. The winner will be awarded the Mirra Golden Pedal and prize money. ESPN owns and produces the X Games, which had no comment on Mirra’s diagnosis.

Forget Gary Johnson. Trump’s presidency would be one long ’Aleppo moment’
What does Gary Johnson know? After yet another easily avoidable televised blunder in which the Libertarian presidential candidate failed to name even one leader of a foreign country that he was fond of, it’s a fair question. If, by some miracle, Johnson were able to cobble together enough support to reach the 15% threshold to qualify for the debates, that would be the only question I would want answered. Just two minutes of Johnson rattling off things he does know. How many eggs in a dozen? That’s a snap, Anderson. It’s 12. Where are babies made, Mr Johnson? Well . .. something about mommies and daddies loving each other, right? Who let the dogs out? Wow, that’s a tough one, Anderson. Can I get back to you after I consult with my advisors? I happen to be heavily courting the dogcatchers’ union. Better yet, this could make a remarkable game show for those lonely summer months when the American broadcast networks air human dart tossing and Family Feud. I’m certain that Are You Smarter Than Gary Johnson would be a smash hit on Fox or The CW. Corral some    and see if they can spot China on a map before Gary. If one of the schoolchildren is successful, they get to debate Trump and Clinton in his place. If you think it’s scary that a presidential candidate polling around 8% nationally can’t identify the name of the city undergoing one of the most horrendous humanitarian crises of the last 30 years and is incapable of recalling any of America’s numerous foreign allies, you are not alone. If you see my hypothetical game show in which prepubescent moppets are more aware of global affairs than Gary Johnson, remember we have a   game show host running for president. Donald Trump, a man who is happy to admit he doesn’t read, may become our   . If he does, these   “Aleppo moments” will become a daily fixture in our lives. What does Donald Trump know about the European Union besides cheeky Brexit slogans,   twit Boris Johnson and where the nearest former Soviet bloc beauty pageant is? Oh right, he doesn’t even know that Belgium is a country, not a city.  Why, then, does the media treat Gary Johnson with indifference mixed with condescension while happily cutting into regularly scheduled programming in order to broadcast Trump’s announcement that after eight years, he can finally accept all the clear evidence that Barack Obama was born in the United States?  It should give us all pause that Gary Johnson and Donald Trump, while a great distance apart in the charisma department, are equally as unqualified to be president. In the most terrifying election of my lifetime, we must face   the system we’ve created. It’s one that rewards sloganeering, platitudes and retweets. It’s one where regurgitating promises  —   lower taxes, crushing Isis, legal weed!  —   is all one needs to rally voters. Everything Clintonites accused Bernie Sanders of  —       ideas, lack of foreign policy experience simple solutions to complex problems  —   is actually true of Johnson and Trump. And there’s also Jill Stein, whose campaign currently consists of reminders that she’s sort of like Bernie Sanders, complete with her own stash of “dank memes”.  A vote for Gary Johnson is a vote for a man who has proven on more than one occasion that he knows very little about the rest of the world, who gets indignant when he is challenged on that fact and who has seemingly made no effort to close this knowledge gap. A vote for Gary Johnson is a vote for a less hateful Donald Trump  —   a man who looks more like a game show contestant than a game show host. If that’s what you’re looking for in this election, then you’re in luck. If you are, then my one question to you is: why?

Elon Musk’s self-driving evangelism masks risk of Tesla autopilot, experts say
Elon Musk’s rockets usually do not stray beyond Earth’s orbit, but that hasn’t stopped him from making promises about Mars. The Tesla CEO’s wild, ambitious futurism has earned him billions of dollars, fawning coverage from the tech press, and a subreddit devoted entirely to discussion of his divinity. But it has also now landed him and his company in the awkward position of explaining why a feature they called “autopilot” should not be to blame for failing to prevent one of their vehicles from driving under a truck in May, killing    Joshua Brown  —   the first known fatality involving a   car. Brown was a Tesla enthusiast with a “need for speed” according to reports by the Associated Press. He had previously posted a video to YouTube of the vehicle avoiding an accident while in autopilot mode, which Musk retweeted. In a blog post on Thursday about the incident, Tesla said: “Neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied. ” The driver of the truck told the AP that he heard a Harry Potter movie being played from the wreck of the car, and the Florida sheriff’s department confirmed that a portable DVD player was found in the car, though it is still not known whether Brown was watching a film at the time of the crash. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating the accident. Since Tesla launched Autopilot’s enhanced cruise control features in October 2014  —   and especially since Autopilot was updated to include   capability in October 2015  —   the company has been careful to stress that drivers remain responsible  —   and liable  —   for any collisions. The company pointed out that this was the first fatal accident in 130m miles driven by all Tesla cars under the control of the autopilot feature, compared with a US average of one fatality every 94m miles. It also pointed out that autopilot is still in a “public beta” phase. But other companies have chosen more conservative descriptions for their assisted cruise control. Volvo calls its current features “  tech” or “park assist pilot” which analysts say are more accurate descriptors than the “autopilot” term Tesla uses. Mercedes calls its package “driver assistance” and “drive pilot” Toyota has a “safety sense” feature, and Honda calls it “sensing”. The fine print of the Tesla Model S owner’s manual includes disclaimers for all manner of conditions and scenarios  —   including heavy rain, snow, fog, and direct sunlight  —   that appear to include the circumstances of the 7 May accident. But in January, just a few months after he chastised drivers for “some fairly crazy videos on YouTube” of   hijinks, Musk told reporters that the Model S was “probably better than humans at this point in highway driving”. Before the updated autopilot was released, he said that the car was “almost able to go [between San Francisco and Seattle] without touching the controls at all”. In April, he distracted fans and reporters from the news of a recall of 2, 700 Model X SUVs with a joking tweet comparing autopilot to the video game Mario Kart. Talulah Riley, Musk’s wife, shared and deleted an Instagram video of herself driving on the highway between Los Angeles and San Diego without holding the wheel. Many of Tesla’s current owners are tech enthusiasts who are eager to try out the most   vehicles. And when Musk products are presented as the forefront of the “autonomous revolution” the perception of some of those drivers is, “I’m already there. I’m already living it,” said Karl Brauer, senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book, an automotive research company. Far from being “there” however, Tesla’s   technology is in what Bryant Walker Smith, an assistant professor of law and engineering at the University of South Carolina, called “the ‘mushy middle’ of the automation spectrum”  —   where   driving is increasing in scope but is not yet capable of replacing the driver completely. Smith, who specializes in the legal ramifications of autonomous cars, said that this middle ground has unique dangers: “The difficulty comes if [issues the computer can’t handle] happen so infrequently. Say it can do 99% but not 100%  —   then people are not ready for the 1%. We see problems of  . People get bored, they start texting or watching a DVD. ” Smith warned against reading too much into this single instance or blaming Tesla, pointing out that there is already “carnage” on American roads which kills 100 people every day. “We don’t know how many of those could have been prevented if those vehicles had automatic braking, or a Tesla Autopilot system. ” However Brauer said it was time for Musk to shift his messaging to clearly acknowledge the limitations of the cars. “These are not   cars. They are driver assist features. Honda and Toyota have been really clear about that from day one . .. It really is important. ” Brauer said Musk’s colorful remarks about the technology often present an exaggerated and dangerous image of the vehicles’ capabilities. “There’s been potentially mixed messages between a disclaimer in the car that says you’ve got to be alert the whole time and this thing is being beta tested, and then his comment that the car is probably better than humans. ” The term “autopilot” draws a dangerous link to flying, said Mary “Missy” Cummings, a Duke University robotics professor and former military pilot. “Most car companies love to equate the driving experience with a cool flying experience   …     but they need to step away from that parallel,” said Cummings, who has been outspoken about the dangers of   cars and the need for tighter restrictions. “I get to fly a fighter jet, because I’m highly trained,” she said. “This accident really highlights the fact that people do not understand the capabilities and limitations of these vehicles. ” For now, the crash makes it clear that Tesla should shut off its autopilot feature for certain   driving on freeways, said Cummings. “Either fix it or turn it off . .. The car was in a place where the computer was blind. The computer couldn’t see the environment for what it was. ” Some experts, however, said the reality is that humans often fail to follow safety recommendations and tend to do a poor job at perceiving risk. “That’s not a judgment on any individual. That’s human nature. This could be anyone of us,” said Don MacKenzie, professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Washington. Ragunathan Rajkumar, professor at the engineering department of of Carnegie Mellon university, agreed. “The question is whether the humans read, understand, and follow what is said on the screen, which I think most people tend to ignore pretty quickly,” he said. “The other issue is that we humans tend to be overconfident with something based on limited experience. ” He pointed to the video Brown posted, in which the system avoided a collision, as potential evidence that Brown had become “overconfident” in the system’s abilities. “He said ‘this did something good for me, so it will be reliable and good for me in every other context’. This leap in confidence comes naturally to humans, but it doesn’t necessarily mean the technology will work in every situation,” Rajkumar said. “It’s a weakness in how humans think. ” Representatives for Tesla declined to comment further.

Twitter to conclude sale negotiations this month, sources say
Twitter has told potential acquirers it is seeking to conclude negotiations about a sale by the time it reports   earnings on 27 October, according to people familiar with the matter.  The timeline is hugely ambitious in the context of most mergers and acquisitions, given that Twitter began mulling a sale only last month. It is the clearest sign yet that CEO Jack Dorsey is pushing to provide clarity to shareholders and employees over the company’s future as quickly as possible. Binding acquisition offers are due in the next two weeks, and Twitter has already whittled down the field of potential acquirers, the people familiar with the matter said this week. Salesforce is in the running, while Disney and Google’s parent company Alphabet have also been contemplating bids, the sources added.  It is not certain the process will result in a sale, the sources cautioned. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.  Twitter and Salesforce declined to comment. Disney and Google did not return requests for comment.  With Salesforce, Twitter might turn its focus to customer service communications and mining its database of tweets for business intelligence. Google would likely be most interested in the social and news dimensions of Twitter. Disney, by contrast, might see it as a way to expand the reach of its sports and entertainment programming.  Twitter has struggled to generate revenue growth and profit, despite having some 313m average monthly active users and a growing presence as a source of news.  The company missed Wall Street’s sales expectations in both the first and second quarters of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, and has yet to produce a net profit in 11 quarters as a public company.  It has also failed to keep pace with rivals, notably Snapchat and Facebook’s Instagram. Both now boast more users than Twitter by most measures, even though they are much newer, and advertisers have begun to migrate their ad dollars accordingly.  Dorsey, who returned to Twitter as CEO more than a year ago, has been part of Disney’s board since 2013.  Twitter went public in November 2013 at $26 a share. The shares peaked above $74 just over a month after its IPO but have been on a steady downward trajectory since.

Is our world a simulation? Why some scientists say it’s more likely than not
When Elon Musk isn’t outlining plans to use his massive rocket to leave a decaying Planet Earth and colonize Mars, he sometimes talks about his belief that Earth isn’t even real and we probably live in a computer simulation. “There’s a billion to one chance we’re living in base reality,” he said at a conference in June. Musk is just one of the people in Silicon Valley to take a keen interest in the “simulation hypothesis” which argues that what we experience as reality is actually a giant computer simulation created by a more sophisticated intelligence. If it sounds a lot like The Matrix, that’s because it is. According to this week’s New Yorker profile of Y Combinator venture capitalist Sam Altman, there are two tech billionaires secretly engaging scientists to work on breaking us out of the simulation. But what does this mean? And what evidence is there that we are, in fact, living in The Matrix? One popular argument for the simulation hypothesis, outside of acid trips, came from Oxford University’s Nick Bostrom in 2003 (although the idea dates back as far as the   philosopher René Descartes). In a paper titled “Are You Living In a Simulation?” Bostrom suggested that members of an advanced “posthuman” civilization with vast computing power might choose to run simulations of their ancestors in the universe. This argument is extrapolated from observing current trends in technology, including the rise of virtual reality and efforts to map the human brain. If we believe that there is nothing supernatural about what causes consciousness and it’s merely the product of a very complex architecture in the human brain, we’ll be able to reproduce it. “Soon there will be nothing technical standing in the way to making machines that have their own consciousness,” said Rich Terrile, a scientist at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. At the same time, videogames are becoming more and more sophisticated and in the future we’ll be able to have simulations of conscious entities inside them. “Forty years ago we had Pong  —   two rectangles and a dot. That’s where we were. Now 40 years later, we have photorealistic, 3D simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and it’s getting better every year. And soon we’ll have virtual reality, we’ll have augmented reality,” said Musk. “If you assume any rate of improvement at all, then the games will become indistinguishable from reality. ” It’s a view shared by Terrile. “If one progresses at the current rate of technology a few decades into the future, very quickly we will be a society where there are artificial entities living in simulations that are much more abundant than human beings. ” If there are many more simulated minds than organic ones, then the chances of us being among the real minds starts to look more and more unlikely. As Terrile puts it: “If in the future there are more digital people living in simulated environments than there are today, then what is to say we are not part of that already?” Reasons to believe that the universe is a simulation include the fact that it behaves mathematically and is broken up into pieces (subatomic particles) like a pixelated video game. “Even things that we think of as continuous  —   time, energy, space, volume  —   all have a finite limit to their size. If that’s the case, then our universe is both computable and finite. Those properties allow the universe to be simulated,” Terrile said. “Quite frankly, if we are not living in a simulation, it is an extraordinarily unlikely circumstance,” he added. So who has created this simulation? “Our future selves,” said Terrile. Not everyone is so convinced by the hypothesis. “Is it logically possible that we are in a simulation? Yes. Are we probably in a simulation? I would say no,” said Max Tegmark, a professor of physics at MIT. “In order to make the argument in the first place, we need to know what the fundamental laws of physics are where the simulations are being made. And if we are in a simulation then we have no clue what the laws of physics are. What I teach at MIT would be the simulated laws of physics,” he said. Harvard theoretical physicist Lisa Randall is even more skeptical. “I don’t see that there’s really an argument for it,” she said. “There’s no real evidence. ” “It’s also a lot of hubris to think we would be what ended up being simulated. ”  Terrile believes that recognizing that we are probably living in a simulation is as   as Copernicus realizing that the Earth was not the center of the universe. “It was such a profound idea that it wasn’t even thought of as an assumption,” he said. Before Copernicus, scientists had tried to explain the peculiar behaviour of the planets’ motion with complex mathematical models. “When they dropped the assumption, everything else became much simpler to understand. ” That we might be in a simulation is, Terrile argues, a simpler explanation for our existence than the idea that we are the first generation to rise up from primordial ooze and evolve into molecules, biology and eventually intelligence and  . The simulation hypothesis also accounts for peculiarities in quantum mechanics, particularly the measurement problem, whereby things only become defined when they are observed. “For decades it’s been a problem. Scientists have bent over backwards to eliminate the idea that we need a conscious observer. Maybe the real solution is you do need a conscious entity like a conscious player of a video game,” he said. For Tegmark, this doesn’t make sense. “We have a lot of problems in physics and we can’t blame our failure to solve them on simulation. ” How can the hypothesis be put to the test? On one hand, neuroscientists and artificial intelligence researchers can check whether it’s possible to simulate the human mind. So far, machines have proven to be good at playing chess and Go and putting captions on images. But can a machine achieve consciousness? We don’t know.  On the other hand, scientists can look for hallmarks of simulation. “Suppose someone is simulating our universe  —   it would be very tempting to cut corners in ways that makes the simulation cheaper to run. You could look for evidence of that in an experiment,” said Tegmark.  For Terrile, the simulation hypothesis has “beautiful and profound” implications. First, it provides a scientific basis for some kind of afterlife or larger domain of reality above our world. “You don’t need a miracle, faith or anything special to believe it. It comes naturally out of the laws of physics,” he said. Second, it means we will soon have the same ability to create our own simulations.  “We will have the power of mind and matter to be able to create whatever we want and occupy those worlds. ”

The economists’ guide to choosing between Trump and Clinton
The parties have spoken and after a brutal campaign season, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are now the official presidential candidates of the Republican and Democratic parties. Now the real fight begins, and the economy will be a key  —   if not the key —   battleground. More than 90% of voters have said that the economy is extremely important to them. The Guardian asked three economists to weigh in on what we can expect from a Trump or Clinton White House. Here is what they had to say: Normal presidential candidates put forth proposals that usually have been vetted by policy experts. They also generally have track records from their time as elected officials. The combination of these factors allows external observers to make   predictions on what policies might get adopted if they get elected and to then speculate on how those policies might affect the economy. Trump is not a normal candidate. To be generous, his views on major economic issues are eclectic. He promises a big tax cut, but it’s probably not very serious since he has no concomitant plan to restrain the growth of government spending. He threatens to impose steep tariffs, which would risk triggering a trade war, but he claims protectionism would merely be a stick to extort concessions from trading partners. He makes noises about potentially defaulting on debt but then pivots and says the debt can be financed by printing money. It’s not clear which would be the frying pan and which would be the fire, but either approach causes angst among most economists. And we can’t forget Trump’s signature issue of immigration. Tougher border enforcement generates a lot of debate about whether America benefits from more   labor, but that controversy would seem minor if Trump actually launched a campaign to locate and deport the    people who already are in the country illegally. With all this uncertainty about what Trump really believes, it’s impossible to guess which policies will change and how the economy would be impacted. For what it’s worth, libertarians generally fear that Trump ultimately would govern as a   populist. Though a Trump victory presumably would mean continued Republican control of the House and Senate, so it would be interesting to see whether traditional Republicans in Congress (who claim to believe in smaller government) would be able to control their seemingly uncontrollable leader. Daniel Mitchell is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. He specializes in fiscal policy, particularly tax reform, international tax competition, and the economic burden of government spending. The most pressing problem in America today remains skyrocketing inequality. If trends since 2010 prevail, by 2018 the income share of the top 1% will be 23. 7% the highest level that figure has reached since the eve of the Great Depression in America. Reining in the growth of inequality is a multifaceted project of decades that requires higher wages, stronger unions, public investments in infrastructure and education from   to  . It’s hard to imagine any president implementing such an ambitious agenda by 2018. There is one concrete policy change that can be achieved by 2018, which is the crucial first step to finance the investments needed to achieve more broadly shared prosperity in America  —   higher taxes on the top 1%.  The Tax Policy Center has analyzed the plans of all three remaining presidential candidates and concluded that the Sanders tax plan would raise the average tax rate on the top 1% to 55. 4% under the Clinton plan it would rise 3. 4 points to 36. 2% and under the Trump plan it would fall 11. 7 points to 21. 8%. By moving in the wrong direction, the Trump plan would accelerate the growth in the income share of the top 1% as the Bush tax cuts did in the early 2000s and by 2018 drive inequality in America to the highest level on record. Both the Clinton and Sanders plans would move decisively in the direction of reducing inequality with the divide between the two plans, like the divide between their passionate supporters, reflecting not as much a differing direction as a differing scope of their ambitions.  Mark Price is a labor economist at the Keystone Research Center. The net effect of Trump’s program will be to cause considerable economic disruption but little if any net gain in employment or output, even while raising the risk of a major economic crisis. Trump proposes to lower taxes and to reduce business regulation and foreign competition for American businesses and jobs. While raising income for the rich, the tax cuts will do little to promote economic growth   has been tried repeatedly over the past 35 years and does little to stimulate the economy, especially in a depressed economy where people and businesses save tax cuts rather than invest or spend. While high tariffs on Chinese or Mexican imports would shift some production to domestic suppliers, the effect will be muted because footloose suppliers will move to other sources not facing the tariffs. Any gains from reduced imports will also be offset by losses among American export industries, such as high technology, entertainment and business services.  Similarly, if undocumented workers are repatriated, it would open some jobs but the net effect will be small and may not even be positive. Many positions vacated by repatriated immigrants will stay vacant for lack of willing workers, and any gains must be balanced when businesses fail because they have lost immigrant labor. The Trump fiscal policy will have some stimulative effect increased economic activity will come from increased spending building walls, and on immigration and customs enforcement and the military.  Any economic growth from the Trump trade and fiscal policies must be balanced by reduced investment due to increased uncertainty coming from his aggressive foreign policy, and the danger that reducing financial market regulation will open the door to misbehavior like that which brought on the crisis in 2007 to 2009. Fear and disruption will discourage investment, reducing employment and output. And reductions in employment will be particularly hard on workers because Trump plans further cuts in the social safety net. While he is pledged to maintain social security retirement and Medicare benefits, he has proposed putting time limits and further restrictions on other programs, including unemployment insurance and supplemental nutrition (food stamps). Should the economy face a major recession, cutbacks in these social insurance programs will further compound the economic downturn. Gerald Friedman is a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  There’s no mystery about the fact that she would move public policy incrementally to the left. Some tax increases, but not giant tax increases. Some new regulations, but not complete government takeovers of industry. A bigger burden of government spending, but not turning America into Greece. An increase in the minimum wage, but not up to $15 an hour. More subsidies for higher education, but not an entitlement for everyone. And some restrictions on trade, but no sweeping reversal of the   consensus that has existed since the second world war. And, needless to say, she won’t support the types of entitlement reforms that have attracted support in the   House and   Senate. Then again, she says she will have her husband serve as some sort of economic czar. And given Bill Clinton’s   record, that implies a more centrist approach and an ability to strike big deals with congressional Republicans. It’s just a guess, but incremental leftism almost certainly will characterize a Clinton presidency, which presumably means a continuation of the current weak economic expansion. Though everything written about Clinton is speculative because we don’t know whether she will have sufficient coattails to help congressional Democrats regain control of the House and Senate.  —    Mitchell, While Clinton would do little to change the direction of the economy, her program will raise employment a little while improving wages and living conditions for working people, especially women, and those in families with young children and those still without health insurance. Clinton has proposed to continue the economic policies of the Obama Administration including its support for free trade and a    for undocumented immigrants, as well as advocating Obama proposal for an increase in the minimum wage (in her case to $ ) as well as small tax increases on the very rich, on large estates, and on financial institutions. Were these to be enacted, it would raise wages for as many as 40 million workers and narrow somewhat the gap between rich and poor. (The increase in the minimum wage would help some workers and would push up effective demand slightly, but its impact would be muted by the enactment of higher state minimum wages elsewhere, including in California and New York.)  She has also proposed increase access to community colleges, expand family leave and childcare, and provide more access to health insurance through the Affordable Care Act these programs would provide real gains for millions of middle income working people. Perhaps the most significant Clinton proposals are in the regulation of financial markets, a major source of the economic crisis of 2007 to 2009. Clinton favors strong enforcement of   and would go further in regulating banks and financial markets to reduce the use of risky financial vehicles. Increased regulation and taxation of risky activities by banks and other financial institutions might also help the economy by reducing the risk of a major financial meltdown. By reducing fear of financial market collapse, tighter regulation may also encourage greater investment, stimulating employment and economic growth.  —   Friedman

Conventional thinking will not solve the climate crisis
The good news   according to the World Energy Council (WEC)   is that, per person, our energy demand is set to peak before 2030. Of course, there will be more of us around by then too, so that total demand will only slow, rather than level out. A heady whiff of technological optimism accompanies the explanation that this will happen because of “unprecedented efficiencies created by new technologies and more stringent energy policies”.  The bad news is that under the scenarios drawn up by the WEC, even keeping to the upper target agreed in Paris of global warming no greater than 2C will require an “exceptional and enduring effort” that goes beyond any current commitments and needs a price for coal, oil and gas that is dramatically higher.  To sweeten this pill, the WEC gives its scenarios names which must appear funky in the world of energy policy. “Modern jazz” is about shiny, digitally driven markets, the slightly less enthusiastic “Unfinished symphony” is about emerging greener models for growth, while “Hard rock” is a future of both low and grubby growth. The problem with these and many other scenarios that emerge in the mainstream, is the intellectual editing that occurs before they even begin. Most share two overwhelming, linked characteristics that strictly limit any subsequent room for manoeuvre. Firstly the demand for energy itself is seen as something innate, unchallengeable and unmanageable. It must be met, and the only question is how.  Secondly, the assumption remains that the principles and practices of the economic model that has dominated for the last 30 years will remain for at least the next 30 years. There is no sign yet of the ferocious challenge to neoliberal orthodoxy happening at the margins of economics shaping mainstream visions of our possible futures. The merest glance at the history of changing ideas suggests this is  . There are reasons why we need to get a move on with tackling energy demand. Extreme weather events abound. Record flooding in North Carolina in the United States follows record flooding in Louisiana earlier in the year. While no individual event can be described a direct cause and effect relationship, increasingly heavy rainfall and flood events are consistent with climate models for a warming world. It’s nearly a year on from the wettest UK December on record in 2015. Subsequently, work by the World Weather Attribution project estimated that the odds for that rainfall event were increased by  % by climate change.  Now, insurers in the UK complain that householders are failing to protect their properties from flooding, while the Environment Agency says that insurers preside over a system in which risk is simply rebuilt where flooding has already taken place. The Climate Change Committee says the UK is off track to meet its   carbon reduction target, just as key decisions on aviation expansion and fracking look set to lock in   infrastructure.  Scenarios for industrial transition are needed that tell a bolder and more convincing tale, not just of the UK meeting its international obligations that are written into treaties, but that go further and stand a genuine chance of limiting warming to 2C. What sort of scenarios should we be looking at then? We can learn from the impoverished Brexit debate that was marred by binary choices cloaked in wilful misinformation. For the whole population to fully understand our options, and the choices and challenges embedded in them, we should be thinking as openly and broadly as possible. We can look at how far   will get us, and at the maximum speed and scale of change that market mechanisms and the pricing of carbon are likely to deliver. In both, the different impacts on rich and poor need assessing.  But we should go further to assess the pros and cons of radical scenarios for changing how we live and work. Rarely considered but important variables come from new economics, including the shorter working week, the share economy, shifts in corporate ownership and governance, and intelligent but deliberate measures for economic localisation. Compare these to the “stumble on” or business as usual scenario, in which we give up control of our future to a permanently destabilised climate change, but also assess seriously the consequences of the argument for planned   “ ” of the economy. At the height of the 2008 financial crisis, the UK government promised to “go beyond the conventional thinking” to put things right. It never did, but with the climate crisis there is no choice. Conventional thinking is   and contradictory. Without a balanced, comparative assessment of strategies to align energy use and industry with inescapable climate action, we won’t be able to choose the best possible future. I’m glad to say that work like this is beginning to happen at places such as the University of Leeds’ centre for industrial energy, materials and products. It’s going to mean telling better stories of change, rewriting rules and breaking ideological chains all around, but hey, that’s jazz   …

Sloppy England earn point in Slovenia thanks to Joe Hart’s stunning saves
Gareth Southgate has had two games in charge for England and, though no one could have seriously expected him to remove all the team’s imperfections in that time, it still cannot be satisfactory that it is so difficult to see even the first flickers of improvement. They were poor again here in Ljubljana and fortunate, in the extreme, that Southgate did not have to reflect on England’s first defeat in a qualifying fixture for seven years. For that, they were indebted to Joe Hart in a match when he reminded us that, on form, he still has games when he can legitimately claim to be one of the best in the business. England were alarmingly susceptible in defence. They rarely passed the ball with any authority and there was absolutely no sense of a group of players desperately trying to impress a new manager. Southgate admitted his team had been lucky and it is not easy finding any compelling evidence to advance the case for him getting the job  . Perhaps that is a harsh conclusion when he has just been parachuted into the role at short notice but, Hart aside, it was difficult to identify a single England player who can reflect on a satisfying evening’s work. The performance was a reminder that removing Wayne Rooney from the starting lineup will not automatically fix this team and, once again, there were a few boos at the final whistle from England’s fans. That will continue to be the soundtrack for as long as England continue to put in these kinds of dishevelled displays. Jesse Lingard and Theo Walcott did little to disprove the theory they were fortunate to be in the team. Daniel Sturridge threatened only sporadically and England’s three shots on target is their lowest in a competitive fixture since playing Costa Rica in the last World Cup. Southgate talked about inheriting “a mess” and the performance left the impression little had changed. His opening line in the   press conference summed it up. “We can play better, for sure,” he said. At least Rooney can still consider himself a favourite of England’s followers. Three days after the Wembley crowd subjected him to minor boos, the first appreciative cry of “Rooney” reverberated round Slovenia’s   stadium within the opening 90 seconds. More notably, there was voluble support for Sam Allardyce, including a loud rendition in the opening few minutes of “Justice for Allardyce” and various other chants making it clear what they thought of the Daily Telegraph investigation that brought him down. If the hardcore fans want Southgate to take charge permanently, this was not an occasion when it became evident. His name was not sung once. Southgate was probably entitled to feel aggrieved about an early attack when Sturridge was knocked over by a Slovenia defender in the penalty area but it would have been misplaced to focus on that moment too much bearing in mind the number of occasions when Hart spared his team. England’s deficiencies first became evident when Eric Dier underhit a backpass in the 10th minute and Hart had to rush from his goalline to block Roman Bezjak’s shot before a second Slovenia attacker, Jasmin Kurtic, curled a   effort against the post. That, however, was far from the only time England found themselves in trouble because of their own carelessness. Gary Cahill, in particular, had a difficult game and could have been sent off for a   challenge on Josep Ilicic late on, leading to a confrontation between Lingard and Aljaz Srtuna. Lingard was defending Marcus Rashford but Southgate was unimpressed and said his player needed to learn some more  . Ilicic created numerous problems for England’s defence but Hart kept him out every time, including one occasion when Jordan Henderson, wearing the captain’s armband with little grace, gave the ball straight to his opponent. Southgate seemed startled by how vulnerable his team were at the back, talking of it being “very much a work in progress”and noting Slovenia’s “opportunities tended to be set pieces or  ”. Twice at the start of the second half, Slovenia had corners from the right and on both occasions Hart denied them with outstanding goalkeeping. The second save, in particular, from Kurtic’s header was the kind of moment to reignite the debate about why Hart is spending the season on loan at Torino. He should never have been exposed so often and Southgate explained that when he brought on Rooney as a   replacement for Sturridge the decision was based on “the need for some experience in there to calm things down”. Slovenia were undoubtedly encouraged by their   win against Slovakia on Saturday but it would still have been reasonable to expect England to play with more control and, though Southgate pointed out it was a difficult playing surface, he did also recognise it was no excuse for the number of times passes were misplaced.

Unity at the Republican convention? Forget about it
Reince Priebus hopes that the convention in Cleveland next week will help unify the GOP. “Given the drama that we’ve had   …     I think now, more than ever, the role of the convention to assist in the unification of the party is going to be extremely important,” the chairman of the Republican National Committee told Milwaukee Journal Sentinel over the Fourth of July weekend. Unfortunately for the chairman, the convention will showcase a Republican party that is about as united as the former Yugoslavia. The best Priebus can hope for is Potemkin displays of unity on stage and no violence off it  —   but even that is not assured. The reality is that over 50% of Republicans, according to a recent Fox News poll, want a different nominee than Donald Trump. An insurgent group of convention delegates are even trying to oust the billionaire real estate mogul as nominee. The last Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, refuses to support Trump. The past two Republican presidents, George W Bush and George HW Bush, will not be coming to the convention and don’t seem to have any interest in endorsing The Donald. The sitting Republican governor of the state the convention is going to be held in, John Kasich of Ohio, has not endorsed Trump either  —   and he seems in no hurry to do so. Politico asked 50 Republican politicians whether they would be interested in speaking at the convention and only a few told the news outlet they would. Many said they weren’t even going to go to the convention. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that it could barely find anyone in Congress willing to speak favorably of the presumptive Republican nominee. “Less than two weeks before the Republican convention, the party’s congressional wing is no more enthusiastic about Donald Trump for president than when he clinched the nomination two months ago,” the story began. Then there is the conservative intellectual establishment, among which Trump is largely reviled (though in some case he is merely despised). The dean of conservative columnists, George Will, even changed his party registration over Trump’s nomination. For Trump’s part, it’s not even clear he wants to unify the party. When Trump came to Capitol Hill last week to meet with Senate Republicans, he called Illinois senator Mark Kirk, who rescinded his endorsement of Trump, a loser. In a testy conservation with Senator Jeff Flake, who has yet to rally behind him, Trump threatened to help defeat the Arizona lawmaker in his   bid. (Flake is not up for   this year.) Trump was more explicit about his view on the importance of unity during a campaign rally in North Carolina last week. “To be honest, I think I win without unity,” he said. “Probably I do better without the support I’m talking about because that’s why I’m here in the first place. ” One of Trump’s most famous surrogates doesn’t seem particularly interested in helping unite the party either. “That gang, they call themselves Never hashtag, whatever, I just call ‘em Republicans Against Trump, or RAT for short,” Sarah Palin said at the Western Conservative Summit in Denver last week. So much for unity. Indeed, a   poll released last Wednesday had Trump winning just 70% of the Republican vote in a race against Hillary Clinton. A Raba Research poll released this week was even worse with Trump garnering just 66% of   Republicans. In both polls, Trump was trailing Clinton by either 11 or 12 percentage points, though in fairness to Trump, the RealClearPolitics polling average has Clinton up closer to 4%. Maybe the party will unite as the race moves toward November out of sheer tribalism or fear of Hillary Clinton’s supreme court picks. Then again, given the opportunity last week to use FBI director James Comey’s scathing report on Clinton’s “extremely careless” handling of classified information as secretary of state to rally Republicans, Trump seemed more interested in talking about the finer qualities of Saddam Hussein. So Priebus should forget about the Republican party uniting at the convention. A more reasonable goal might be to prevent unrest. But even that is not a  . Liberal groups have stated their intent to protest in Cleveland. In response, a   group has said it will send representatives to protect Trump supporters from the protesters. That’s a toxic recipe for something, but whatever it is, it sure isn’t unity.

Men who act as breadwinners face negative health effects, study finds
Men who act as the primary breadwinners in their marriages are more likely to face psychological and health hurdles, according to a new study that looks at a potential adverse impact of traditional gender roles.  The study, released on Friday by University of Connecticut sociologists, found that as men take on a greater share of economic responsibility in their marriage, they reported greater strains on their wellbeing and health. In years where men in question were their family’s sole breadwinner, their psychological and health outcomes were at their worst. “Men are expected to be breadwinners, yet providing for one’s family with little or no help has negative repercussions,” said lead author Christin Munsch, professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut. “A lot of what we know about how gender plays out in marriage focuses on the ways in which women are disadvantaged,” she said. “Our study contributes to a growing body of research that demonstrates the ways in which gendered expectations are harmful for men too. ” But the study also looked at women and found a contrasting psychological outcome. For women, taking on a greater financial responsibility in their marriages had positive effects on happiness and wellbeing. “Women . .. may approach breadwinning as an opportunity or choice,” said Munsch, who   the paper with Matthew Rogers and Jessica Yorks, graduate students at the university. “Breadwinning women may feel a sense of pride, without worrying what others will say if they can’t or don’t maintain it. ” “After all, they have accomplished something rare for their gender,” the study says, about women who are their family’s primary breadwinner. “Should they fail to maintain this status, however, they have less to lose” than men in the same position, based on social expectations. For decades, the number of US households with men as the primary breadwinner has steadily decreased. Experts attribute this to a number of factors, including changing gender roles in heterosexual marriages, as well as increasing numbers of women in the workforce. The decrease of male breadwinners overall is also related to a greater number of single mother households, which according to a 2013 Pew Research Center study accounts for some   of the 40% of US households with children where the primary breadwinner was a woman. According to Pew figures, 46% of   households both work   up from 31% in 1970. Figures from the US Census Bureau show that in just over 50% of all married couples, both the man and woman are in the labor force in just over 20% of couples, the man alone is in the labor force and in just under 10% only the woman is in the labor force. The new findings are based on data contained in the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) a study conducted over time by the Bureau of Labor Statistics which provides data from a nationally representative group about various measures of their life, job history and general wellbeing. Survey respondents were asked how much time they spent during the last month being nervous, calm and peaceful, downhearted and blue, happy, and “so down in the dumps that nothing can cheer you up”. Their happiness level was ranked from one to five based on their response.  Philip Victor, a    journalist living in Atlanta, said he does feel pressure as the sole breadwinner in his family. He has a young child and    wife of four years who is currently studying for her nursing exam, and said both he and his wife look forward to a time when economic responsibility is shared. “But I would say that sense of pressure comes from being the primary income earner and not simply because I’m a man. “I can’t wait for the day when my wife passes her exam and starts working because we will be financially better off as a family and my wife will be thrilled about actualizing her dream of working as a nurse —   that alone will a tremendous psychological boost to both of us. ” Matt Mehrhoff, 31, a school teacher in Lincoln, Nebraska, described experience on both sides of the breadwinning equation in his marriage of four years.  He said that he and his wife have at various points taken on more or less economic burden, including when he was in graduate school, or after the recent birth of their son. “I’m not sure if it has to do with my gender, but after getting a better paying job and having a newborn, I definitely feel more pressure,” he said. “As I have been able to pay a larger share of family bills, I feel a stronger need to continue to do so or pay an even bigger share to be able to take some of the pressure off of my spouse. ” The researchers acknowledged the significant limitations of its findings, particularly as they apply to   couples. The NLSY covers people between the ages of 18 and 32 who are in heterosexual marriages. “Consequently, we cannot presume that the reported relationships will hold in older populations, gay and lesbian populations, or cohabiting populations,” the study said. The findings run counter to some previous studies about men and women in heterosexual marriages. One study by Olin Business School at Washington University in 2013 found that in relationships where women earned more than men, the latter experienced higher rates of sexual and psychological problems. The study acknowledges that the anxiety that individuals have in marriages based on their economic dependence or independence might be affected by their prior views about traditional gender roles. “It may be the case that breadwinning provokes anxiety among men who desire more equitable arrangements, but has little effect among men who desire more traditional arrangements,” the study said. “Similarly, economic dependency may elicit anxiety among women who prefer egalitarian marriages, but not among women who prefer more traditional arrangements. ”

American Crime Story season three to tackle Gianni Versace murder
American Crime Story has been renewed for a third season set to focus on the murder of fashion designer Gianni Versace. According to Deadline, it will shoot simultaneously with the second season which will cover the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The first season, which was centered on the trial of OJ Simpson, was a ratings hit and won five Emmys earlier this year. The anthology series was masterminded by Ryan Murphy, who also created American Horror Story and Glee. Murphy is also working on Feud, the first season of which will focus on the rivalry between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. Details are scarce on the   season of American Crime Story, but it is reportedly subtitled  . Andrew Cunanan was the serial killer who murdered Versace on the steps of his Miami Beach house in 1997. Eight days later, he killed himself. It will be based on the book Vulgar Favors by Maureen Orth and Child   Spy writer Tom Rob Smith will take on the first two episodes and possible subsequent installments. No casting decisions have been made yet, but there are rumours that an   is in talks to play Donatella Versace. The first season of American Crime Story reunited American Horror Story stars Sarah Paulson and Connie Britton, as well as new recruits John Travolta, Cuba Gooding Jr, David Schwimmer and Sterling K Brown.

Climate change will mean the end of national parks as we know them
After a century of shooing away hunters, tending to trails and helping visitors enjoy the wonder of the natural world, the guardians of America’s most treasured places have been handed an almost unimaginable new job  —   slowing the   assault climate change is waging against national parks across the nation. As the National Parks Service (NPS) has charted the loss of glaciers, sea level rise and increase in wildfires spurred by rising temperatures in recent years, the scale of the threat to US heritage across the 412 national parks and monuments has become starkly apparent. As the National Parks Service turns 100 this week, their efforts to chart and stem the threat to the country’s history faces a daunting task. America’s grand symbols and painstakingly preserved archaeological sites are at risk of being winnowed away by the crashing waves, wildfires and erosion triggered by warming temperatures.  The Statue of Liberty is at “high exposure” risk from increasingly punishing storms. A national monument dedicated to abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who will be enshrined on a new $20 note, could be eaten away by rising tides in Maryland. The land once walked by Pocahontas and Captain John Smith in Jamestown, the first English settlement in the US, is surrounded by waters rising at twice the global average and may be beyond rescue.  These threats are the latest in a pile of identified calamities to befall national parks and monuments due to climate change. Receding ice, extreme heat and acidifying oceans are morphing America’s landscapes and coasts at a faster pace than at any time in human history.  “Yosemite’s famous glacier, once a mile wide, is almost gone,” fretted Barack Obama during a visit to the vast park in June.  “Rising temperatures could mean no more glaciers in Glacier national park, no more Joshua trees in Joshua Tree national park.  “Rising seas can destroy vital ecosystems in the Everglades and at some point could even threaten icons like the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. That’s not the America I want to pass on to the next generation. ” Change, however, is inevitable no matter how quickly greenhouse gas emissions are cut. An NPS study from 2014 found four in five of America’s national parks are now at the “extreme end” of temperature variables charted since 1901.  “We are starting to see things spiral away now,” said Gregor Schuurman, an ecologist at the NPS climate change response program. “We are going to look back at this time and actually think it was a calm period. And then people will start asking questions about what we were doing about the situation. ” There is now a broad new push to work out exactly what heritage is at risk and how to best to react. If there is a front line, it’s probably found in Alaska. The state has 24 national parks, including Denali, the largest protected park in the US at 6m acres. It is also part of the Arctic, the fastest warming region on Earth. Permafrost, which currently sits underneath 80% of Alaska, is beginning to melt, causing sinkholes and landslides. The   coast is being chewed away by almost 150ft a year in places due to sea level rise aided by wind erosion from more intense storms. Wildfires are increasing, with a lack of snow cover allowing the flames to lick areas that haven’t burned in almost 5, 000 years. These trends imperil treasures such as those found in Cape Krusenstern national monument on the   coast. It has extensive evidence of human habitation stretching back 9, 000 years. The NPS is scrambling to survey the area as inundations are wiping away this heritage, often before archaeologists can document it. Dael Devenport, an NPS archaeologist based in Anchorage, takes regular helicopter trips to survey the   coast of the park. There are groups of abandoned houses claimed by the sea and wind, containing items such as lamps, stone tools and ulus  —   a type of half   knife used to skin seals and caribou. The Inupiat people who live in the region have retreated from this part of the coast. “A lot of these sites haven’t been surveyed properly, we are trying to figure out which are most vulnerable and mitigate against that,” Devenport said. “You can see houses that are washing away, if you walk along the coast you see the profile of houses. “Most people haven’t thought about how climate change affects archeological sites. A site is a snapshot in time, it’s not like we can pick it up and move it somewhere else. We are in danger of losing a great deal. ” The problem is exacerbated by rampant looting of artifacts. A recent survey found almost all of a former settlement of the Thule culture, ancestors of today’s Inuit, had been disturbed and stripped of items such as harpoon tips and figurines carved from walrus ivory. As permafrost melts and walls are washed away, more treasures are revealed to opportunists.  “It’s a big problem,” Devenport acknowledged. “It’s probably done by people from local communities who know where the sites are. They can sell items onto dealers, who can get about $50, 000 for a figurine from a buyer in Japan.  “When that artifact has been pulled out from the ground and not documented, we lose all of that information. You’ve lost the whole story behind that item and how it was used. ” Further south, in the lower 48 states, a different heritage is at risk. Changing rainfall patterns are affecting a number of parks in the  . Extreme rain events caused two major wall collapses in historic structures at Tumacácori national historical park in southern Arizona. The structures, built by Spanish missionaries more than 300 years ago, are made from adobe, a type of   clay. The NPS already devotes 2, 500 hours a year to maintain these buildings. However climate change is placing a further strain on this heritage. “For the more vulnerable sites, particularly adobe structures which seem to be the canaries in the coal mine in the   US, losses are already rapidly occurring,” said the NPS’ Lauren Meyer, who is heading new research into the issue.  Meyer said there is a “great urgency” to intervene and save cultural sites at risk from a rapidly warming planet. “The longer we wait to act, the more history we lose,” she said. Conservationists complain about a lack of funding to identify and preserve   sites, but even if these locations could all be propped up and artifacts protected, the changes to the wider ecosystems march on. Temperature increases vary slightly according to park (the Grand Canyon has warmed on average by 2. 4F since 1916, while the Everglades has heated up by 1. 5F)  —   but the trend is inexorably upwards. This warming is influencing a complex web of processes in national parks. As John Muir, considered the father of US national parks, put it: “Tug on anything at all and you’ll find it connected to everything else in the universe. ” Climate change is set to alter American forests as much as the arrival of white settlers did. The fire season is expanding dramatically. Some species are suffering, such as the native birds of Hawaii targeted by invasive mosquitos, which are able to survive in higher elevations as the forest habitat warms.  The remaining 65 groves of huge sequoia trees in California, among the largest living things on the planet, could be decimated by a warmer, drier climate.   species, such as red spruce and balsam fir, could be pushed off the mountains. The tree that gives Joshua Tree national park its name may not be able to adapt. Such changes cascade through the food chain. The grizzly bears of Yellowstone like to feast on the cone seeds of the white bark pine, a species under attack from the mountain pine beetle. If warmer winters fail to kill off the beetle, the bears will have to find another food source, impacting other species. A lack of snow for denning will affect bears and wolves warming river waters will force out the salmon. “It’s hard to predict exactly what will happen but some systems have been pushed over the threshold, certainly,” said Schuurman.  “We need to recognize that climate change is ongoing and we can only expect the impacts will get stronger time goes on. I tell park managers that whether they are thinking about climate change every day or not, it is likely to find you and tap you on the shoulder. We should take heed of it. ” A pressing question for the NPS is how these changes will go down with the public. Last year was a record, with 305 million visitors to national parks. But Sally Jewell, secretary of the interior, recently warned that a lack of funding to deal with the “existential” threat of climate change, along with unchecked development, will lead to ruin. Jewell said that current trends mean that the next century will mean “national parks and wildlife refuges will be like postage stamps of nature on a map. Isolated islands of conservation with   facilities that crowds of Americans visit like zoos to catch a glimpse of our nation’s remaining wildlife and undeveloped patches of land. ” Some national parks are already looking at how to respond to this potentially diminished future. Parks in the south, for example, may offer nighttime activities such as star gazing or  .  Visitation could actually jump by nearly 25% in 2060 as it warms, according to one forecast. The summer months may become too hot for visitors to parks in the southwest. Either way, it will be hard to hide that a trip to the Rocky Mountains in Montana to see Glacier national park won’t involve seeing any actual glaciers. “Yes, that will be a visible and dramatic change,” said Schuurman. “Without being blasé in any way, people are adaptable and Glacier national park without its glaciers will still be a stunningly beautiful place. That said, I think anyone would look back and be sad about the loss. ” Temperature rise, Temperatures across US national parks have risen by about 2. 4F in the past century.  Disappearing snow and ice  The number of glaciers at Glacier national park has halved since 1968. All of the park’s glaciers are on course to completely disappear by the middle of the century. Sea level rise, Approximately 40 protected sites are at risk from a 1m sea level rise, with an NPS analysis calling it “one of the most obvious and most challenging impacts” of global warming. The Everglades could become inundated with salt water, with the ecosystem overwhelmed by invasive species drawn to its changed environment. More powerful storms could endanger the Statue of Liberty, which closed for nine months after Hurricane Sandy in 2012.  Wildfire, The wildfire season in the west is far lengthier than it was in the 1970s. The risk is compounded by shrinking snow abundance  —   in Yellowstone there is an average of 30 fewer days with snow on the ground compared to the 1960s.

Gridlock in West Africa: Accra’s troubled attempts to tackle its traffic crisis
Every morning before the sun rises, Stella Ampofo, a    single mother of two boys, frantically gathers her belongings and sets off for work to beat the morning traffic in Ghana’s capital, Accra. If she doesn’t leave before daybreak, congestion during rush hour could extend her   journey from Accra’s suburbs towards downtown to three or four hours.  “I’m in trouble if I leave my house around 6 or 6. 30am,” Ampofo says. “I then won’t arrive at work until nine or 10am, and that creates a lot of problems with my manager because I’m supposed to get there by eight. If the government doesn’t do anything about the traffic, it’s not going to get any easier   …    ”  To ensure a punctual arrival, Ampofo, a seamstress at a manufacturing centre that converts plastic waste into reusable products, leaves her home at 4am every day and begins work an hour later  —   just as the road traffic starts to build up, as roughly 2 million daily commuters converge on the central business district in downtown Accra. Clouds of black exhaust fumes hover over the heads of impatient motorists. Cab drivers blast their horns, while pedestrians scurry on to rickety commercialised minibuses  —   referred to as “tro tros” by locals  —   that carry up to   passengers squeezed tightly together. Only motorcyclists who can skilfully manoeuvre between lanes are able to bypass the congestion. Although gridlock typically costs European economies billions of dollars annually, insufficient data in developing countries makes it difficult to assess the economic impact on cities such as Accra. A recent report by the World Bank measuring the cost of air pollution globally, however, provides some insight into how congestion affects people’s health. Gridlock causes longer travel times, which increases fuel use and emissions. In 2013, a total of 17, 524 Ghanaians died from air pollution, a 107% increase from 1990.  “Accra has struggled with the management of the mobility challenges and rising traffic congestion on almost all arterial routes to the central business district,” Lawrence Kumi, director of research, statistics and information management at Ghana’s Ministry of Transport, admits in an email. “The implementation of various remedial measures was on an   basis and not well coordinated. There was the need for a holistic approach. ” In 2014, the government of Ghana began developing a plan to reduce congestion and overhaul the urban transportation system in the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (Gama) which includes Accra and its outskirts. The plan was in collaboration with the Korea International Cooperation Agency (Koica) and supported by a $1. 5m grant from the South Korean government. Before the end of this year, the final transport master plan (TMP) is due to be presented to Ghana’s ministry of transport for implementation. The plan seeks to “bring together all modes of transport   …     not only by road” and “reduce traffic congestion and logistic costs” over the next 20 years. Greater Accra’s current population of around 4. 3 million is predicted to almost double by 2035  —   likewise the number of vehicles on the roads. While increased congestion can reflect a city’s growing economic vitality, the potential negative effects  —   low worker productivity,   delays, more dangerous roads, commuter stress, pressure on road infrastructure and an unhealthy intake of dirty fuel emissions  —   will place a serious strain on the city if it is not addressed soon. Accra is not alone in facing transportation challenges. Nearby Lagos, the economic capital of Nigeria, is notorious for being one of the most gridlocked cities in the world. But its population is around five times Accra’s, and its economy greater than the whole of Ghana  —   so according to Kweku Amoasi, associate director for transport planning at the   engineering consultancy RSK, Accra should have no excuse when it comes to severe congestion. “With a small population, Ghana should be able to manage traffic much better,” Amoasi says. “There’s just been a total lack of foresight. The planners should sit down and realise they’re not doing this for themselves they’re doing it for the nation. ”  Bernard Abeiku Arthur, a senior urban specialist with   Cities Alliance, says it is this kind of regulatory neglect that has led to today’s unabating traffic troubles and dysfunctional transport system in Accra. “We knew the population was growing,” Arthur says. “We knew we were getting urbanised, but we ignored all the necessary ingredients and elements for planning our urban space properly. ” Arthur says the new TMP is “very fanciful” on paper, but also too limiting geographically  —   excluding regions beyond Greater Accra from which much of the traffic originates. “The urban area is impacted by the fringes,” Arthur said. “So if you’re doing your calculation and you cut out the fringes, you might not be doing a very good calculation. ”  Francis Akakpo, programme officer at Koica in Ghana, says the planners were unable to conduct research on areas beyond the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area because of “limited time and resources”.  Ghana’s first mass transit bus system, Omnibus Services Authority, was established in 1927 during the British colonial period. After independence, public transportation remained largely   until the late 1980s and early 90s, when the government divested itself of assets amid financial mismanagement. This was when the privately run buses appeared to fill the gap: the tro tro, a significant contributor to congestion, has been the most common mode of mass transportation ever since.  In September, however, the Greater Accra Passenger Transport Executive launched a pilot run of a new Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) system, unleashing city buses across several major routes throughout Greater Accra. In defiance of Ghana president John Mahama’s claims that this marked “the beginning of a new modern public transport network” for the city, tro tro operators and other commercial drivers threatened to strike over fears the new buses would force them out of operation.  The final TMP proposes building on the city’s new bus network by replacing thousands of tro tros with   buses that promise to be safer, faster and more comfortable  —   a move that looks set to increase tensions with the existing transport providers. These buses will only be released “on a gradual, incremental basis, to make room for adoption and acceptance” says Koica’s Francis Akakpo. But according to Abeiku from Cities Alliance, even a successful implementation of the public bus system will only provide minimal relief to congestion. For sustainable   improvements, he says, planners must commit to focusing on rail, tram and subway developments so commuters like Stella Ampofo aren’t forced to upend their daily lives just to get to work.   “We have to envision what kind of city we want Accra to be,” Abeiku says. “Do we want a city that supports its economy, whose people feel free to move around? A city where public transportation is properly regulated? That is the kind of city I want. ” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion

Michelle Obama: ‘She took first lady chic and made it modern’
When Michelle Obama gets on the microphone, the world listens. Her speech at the Democratic convention in July was judged by many to be the best of the week, reaching the emotional and inspirational heights that Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign has sometimes struggled to achieve. Her turn on Carpool Karaoke with James Corden this summer, singing Beyoncé and Stevie Wonder, has, at the time of writing, been watched nearly 44m times on YouTube. But for most of the eight years she has lived in the White House, there has been no microphone. Obama is seen a good deal more than she is heard, so how she looks has taken on disproportionate significance. Her image sets the emotional tone for the White House, becoming a symbolic ideal for other women, for other wives and mothers. Every new hairstyle has been combed as a cipher for a change in the national mood every dress evaluated for the values it embodies. There is no denying that this feels retrograde for a woman of Obama’s intellect and background. There is a    rhythm to this kind of coverage, with every fashion feature on her wardrobe triggering an opinion piece raging at this unbefitting treatment of a   lawyer with degrees from Harvard and Princeton. Yet, contrary to what many expected, Obama herself has played the role in a notably traditional key. In contrast to her predecessor Hillary Clinton’s battles over public healthcare, she has adopted relatively uncontroversial causes: family nutrition, childhood health and girls’ education, issues that sit neatly around her   identity as   . While these causes are, perhaps, more culturally loaded than they first appear  —   the campaign against childhood obesity has a more progressive slant when you take into account the fact that the issue disproportionately affects   and black families  —   they have frustrated those who hoped for a more radical rewrite. Obama has followed in the first lady tradition by putting fashion centre stage of her public persona. On the night of her husband’s election to office in 2008, she wore a Narciso Rodriguez dress in a fiery    speckle pattern. The fashion press reported the pattern as “dégradé” while others went with “lava lamp”. To wear a very   dress at such a moment made it clear that Obama had no intention of allowing the White House to cramp her style. She had broken an unspoken rule of modern culture, which holds that a serious person must have a sober wardrobe. Until Obama, the iconography of the first lady revolved around Jackie Kennedy. There had been glamorous president’s wives since  —   Nancy Reagan with her Dynasty gowns, say  —   but the notion of first lady chic remained almost synonymous with that sunny yet streamlined   style that is for ever Camelot. Half a century later, wives of heads of state all over the world are still measured against Kennedy, but the comparison is sharpest in the White House. Where her predecessors had tiptoed around the edges of Kennedy style, as if anxious to avoid the comparison, Obama has embraced many elements of the look and made them her own. The sleeveless shift dresses she favours are a direct link, as are the outsize strings of pearls, often framed by   necklines. Even elements of the two women’s hair and makeup are similar, despite their physical difference: note the full, stiffly curled hair and the penchant for false eyelashes. The Kennedys represent an American ideal that is classy and democratic, and Obama has used fashion to ally herself and her husband with that same message. The visual connection with the Kennedys draws the eye to the obvious difference: their skin colour. It’s a way of emphasising the historic nature of the Obamas as the first black family to live in the White House, while at the same time telling the world that this family, and this administration, is traditionally American. At the first inauguration, in January 2009, Obama wore a dress and matching coat in an unusual shade of pale greenish yellow that observers struggled to put a name to. (The Guardian went with lemongrass.) Her elder daughter, Malia, wore a purple coat with black scarf and gloves her younger daughter, Sasha, a pink coat with orange scarf and gloves. The colours made for a dazzlingly confident family portrait. Other elements of the look were formal, even traditional (the first lady’s sleek leather gloves, the two girls in their cosy,   coats) but the colours were modern, the cheery brights of a holiday snap rather than the sepia tones of an official photograph. That was the day Obama took first lady chic and made it modern and   . Later that year, on a state visit to Britain, she wore an Azzedine Alaïa cardigan to meet the Queen. “You don’t go to Buckingham Palace in a sweater,” sniffed the designer Oscar de la Renta  —   but he was already out of touch. Obama’s approachable,   wardrobe had struck a chord. Without wearing a single outfit that could be considered truly   Obama has rewritten the playbook. In early 2009, when the first lady’s official website was launched featuring a photo of her wearing a sleeveless dress, the Chicago Tribune reported that it had received hundreds of online responses, many of which criticised the look for its inappropriate informality. Since then, the trend for the sleeveless dress as grownup but fun, dressy but comfortable  —   fuelled, in huge part, by Obama herself  —   has grown and grown. She made it OK for a   woman to wear a dress showcasing arms that speak of serious   as well as those signature warm Mobama hugs. In that sense, she represents a generation growing old in a different way. Many of her fashion choices  —   from the girlish, bridal Jason Wu gown she wore for the first inauguration to the full skirts she often favours for daytime  —   are looks that not long ago would have been thought too young, too cute, for a woman in her 50s to carry off. Instead, she has captured something of the confidence of a generation who will not accept that they should slip into the shadows. Obama has consistently played down any interest in fashion. “It’s so hard. I’m kind of a   at heart, but I like to look nice,” she told ABC news in 2008. But she has steered her image carefully nonetheless. When she appeared on the cover of American Vogue in March 2009, she did it on condition that the choice of dress was hers, without input from the Vogue team, and that she used her own hair and makeup stylists, something the magazine had not agreed to before. Even the designer and   Tom Ford, renowned for his control freak tendencies, alluded to Obama’s strictures in a recent interview with the Hollywood Reporter, when he related the experience of dressing the first lady for an audience with the Queen in 2011. “Doing something like that is easy because you’re dictated to,” he said. “‘She needs to wear that colour, she has to have gloves, she doesn’t like this, she doesn’t like that.’ It’s pretty simple. ” Simple, but strategic. Obama’s mastery of fashion is less about the clothes than about a modern woman’s innate understanding that visual messaging is a crucial part of public life. As she told American InStyle magazine last month, “We can fool ourselves into thinking that everybody is still watching the evening news, but I live with Generation Z, and I know that their habits, the way they take in information, are so different  …     We’ve got to meet our constituents where they are, and they’re on Snapchat. ” Obama has been on Snapchat since June. Her opening post? A selfie and the emoji of the girl in pink, her hand raised. This is a woman who doesn’t need a microphone to get her words across.

USA make do with silver in men’s team archery as South Koreans clinch gold
South Korea’s archers routed the United States to win the men’s team gold at the Rio Olympics on Saturday and restore a dynasty broken by the Americans at London four years ago. The peerless trio of Kim   Ku   and Lee   roared to a   win on a baking hot day at the Sambodromo, clinching South Korea’s fifth team title and fourth in the last five Olympics. “I’ve been waiting for this moment, to get gold, for four years,” beaming world champion Kim, who fired a   world record during Friday’s ranking round, told reporters. “We trusted each other, and it happened. It just happened. ” The US team, who ended the South Koreans’ run of three titles in the London   were left with a second successive silver after the Koreans closed out the match in style with a run of perfect scores. Australia celebrated their first archery medal in 12 years by defeating China for the bronze. All three Olympic debutants, Kim, Ku and Lee, showed no sign of rookie nerves as they trampled over Netherlands and Australia before saving their best for the gold  . Cheered by a rowdy Korean contingent in the terraces, the trio threw down the gauntlet in the opening set, hitting the innermost gold circle six times in succession to score the maximum 60 points. More than a statement, the opening salvo was a winding blow for the more seasoned US team of   Olympian Brady Ellison, Jake Kaminski and Zach Garrett. They shot well in response but could manage only 57 points for the set and from there the pattern of the match was fixed. The Korean onslaught was relentless. The    Ku took the perfect score of 10 points with all six of his arrows, and missed only once. Standing on the podium in the middle of a team of world champions, Ku kissed his medal and beamed, while Lee wiped a tear from his cheek during their national anthem. The team sealed South Korea’s 20th archery gold medal from 37 Olympic titles contested since the sport returned in its modern format in 1972. With its professional teams and punishing training regimes, the depth of Korean archery is unmatched and the nation will be disappointed if it fails to sweep all four titles at Rio. “There really wasn’t anything we could have controlled,” Kaminski, who lost the London final against Italy with Ellison, said resignedly. “I definitely feel we left it all out there. ”

Clinton v Trump: why the first post-debate poll should be read with caution
Maybe you watched the first presidential debate of 2016. Maybe you’re an American voter. And maybe, just maybe, you felt one candidate was a very clear winner by the end of it all. The only question you should now be asking yourself is “how many other people in the country agreed with me?” I have one poll (and a whole bunch of caveats) for you. The poll suggests that the debate was a huge success for Hillary Clinton. The caveats suggest Democrats don’t have a reason to celebrate yet. The poll was jointly conducted by media channel CNN and research company ORC late last night. The interviewers called up people they had already identified who said they planned on watching the debate. The survey started out with this question: “Regardless of which candidate you happen to support, who do you think did the best job in the debate  —   Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?” At 62% it was a clear win for Clinton, while just 27% said Trump (6% said “both equally” and 4% said “neither” candidate won the debate). The other polling questions seemed to confirm a clear victory: Who seemed to be the stronger leader? Clinton 56% Trump 39% Who was more sincere and authentic? (Note: this has been a problem for Clinton in the past. )Clinton 53% Trump 40%  Overall, did the debate make you more likely to vote for a candidate? Clinton 34% Trump 18% It all sounds like bad news for Republicans right? Maybe not. The poll was conducted among 521 people  —   even though those people were all registered voters, that’s still not very many views you’re collecting. There’s another thing too  —   the entire poll was skewed towards Clinton to start off with. Of the people   spoke to, 41% identified themselves as Democrats and 26% identified as Republican (the rest said they were Independents). So you would have expected Clinton to do better, regardless of how she performed during the debate. If you’re feeling particularly skeptical, you should pay attention to “the margin of error” on a poll. On this one, it was +   4. 5 percentage points which means that Clinton’s lead could be much larger (take that last question above  —   the true national number could be as high as 38. 5% choosing Clinton) or it could be much smaller (maybe only 29. 5% did). When you take into account the fact that there were a lot of Democrats in this survey, that lead suddenly looks a lot less impressive.  One last thing  —   and you’ll hear me say this a lot  —   it’s only one poll. Anyone who tells you it’s a done deal after last night is probably influenced by confirmation bias which when you interpret new information (eg this poll) in a way that confirms your existing beliefs (eg “I think Clinton did pretty well”).  What actually does offer some promise of predicting voter behavior is taking a big bunch of surveys, each reputable, each with a slightly different methodology, and averaging them out. So, to really understand who won the debate, we’ll need to wait a little while because most surveys take about a week to be conducted, analyzed and then published.  Right now, in polling averages, Clinton currently has 46. 7% of support, barely ahead of Trump who receives 44. 3%. Viewers not only need to think Clinton did really well in last night’s debate, but they need to be willing to change their voting intention if the former secretary of state wants to win in November.

Congress remains deadlocked over $1.1bn Zika bill after seven-week break
As the US Congress returned to Washington on Tuesday after a   recess, lawmakers remained at an impasse over funding to combat the Zika virus even after the   disease spread rapidly during the summer across Puerto Rico and a host of states across the US. Democrats in the US Senate again blocked a measure that would provide $1. 1bn in funding to tackle Zika, objecting to language inserted by House Republicans that would target Planned Parenthood, undermine healthcare and reverse a ban on flying the Confederate flag at veterans’ cemeteries. The   procedural vote marked the third time the bill had failed to garner the 60 votes required to advance, prompting a bipartisan blame game that has become par for the course on Capitol Hill. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said it was “hard to explain” why Democrats had blocked the funding, while his Democratic counterpart Harry Reid accused Republicans of being “more interested in attacking Planned Parenthood and flying the Confederate flag  —   can’t make this stuff up, that’s really the truth  —   than protecting women and babies from this awful virus”. But away from the   senators frustrated by the inaction conceded an agreement must be reached with just three weeks remaining until lawmakers depart once more for a final stretch at home before election day.  Roy Blunt, a senator from Missouri and member of Republican leadership, signaled the path forward could be to tie Zika funding to a continuing resolution that must be passed by 30 September to prevent a shutdown of the federal government. Although he did not yet know what that package might look like, Blunt acknowledged that Republicans might have to do without the Planned Parenthood rider and other provisions being decried by Democrats as “poison pills”.  “Surely, the goal of the Senate should be to get each of those things done as soon as we possibly could,” he said. Marco Rubio, the Florida senator and former Republican presidential candidate, told reporters it was “pretty clear” Democrats were not going to accept the language related to Planned Parenthood and renewed his call for House Republicans to take up a bipartisan Zika bill that passed the Senate back in May. That measure provided $1. 1bn in funding with no strings attached. Susan Collins, a Republican senator from Maine known for forging compromises across party lines, was more explicit in calling for the language restricting funds to a Planned Parenthood affiliate in Puerto Rico to be dropped from the bill. “Given that a lot of women are going to decide to delay childbearing during this public health crisis, it does not make sense to exclude an organization like Planned Parenthood which is a source of family planning for so many,” she said. “I view this as a public health crisis and one that we should act on. ” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have estimated more than 2, 700 cases of Zika in the continental US  —   putting the figures at more than double what they were when Congress skipped town in July without resolving the stalemate. There are at least 14, 000 cases in US territories, with Puerto Rico the most heavily impacted by the virus. Barack Obama, who first called for $1. 8bn in funding to combat Zika in February, was forced to reallocate money from other programs  —   such cancer research  —   which public health officials said were no less vital. It was the only way to prevent a lapse in clinical trials for vaccine development, which CDC director Tom Frieden warned could soon grind to a halt without additional funds from Congress. The pleas of health experts have nonetheless gone ignored against the backdrop of   politics.  Speaking at a rally in Tampa, Florida, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton reiterated her call on Republicans to vote in favor of a Zika bill that did not seek concessions in return. “They can’t help themselves from playing games, even when lives are on the line,” Clinton said. “I call on all Republicans to put people before politics and finally vote on a clean funding bill to fight Zika right here in Florida. ” South Florida, dubbed as “ground zero” for Zika in the US, remains the hardest hit by the outbreak. In addition to the state having confirmed 577 cases of people who contracted the virus while traveling overseas, concerns are now rising over local transmissions.  The Florida department of health announced seven new cases on Tuesday in which people contracted Zika from mosquitos in Miami Beach  —   the epicenter of the city’s $24bn tourism industry  —   bringing the tally of homegrown cases above 50. With control of the Senate up for grabs in November, the partisan rancor over Zika could prove a wedge issue in the battleground of Florida. Rubio, who is seeking   to a second term, is facing a challenge from Democratic congressman Patrick Murphy in a race that is critical for Republicans to hold onto their slim   majority. Murphy on Tuesday attacked Rubio as ineffective in delivering Zika funding to Florida, telling reporters his opponent was “playing politics with women’s health. ” His comments followed a new   ad buy in Florida by Naral   America, one of the nation’s largest abortion rights groups, which targets Rubio for opposing abortion even if a woman is infected by Zika.  But not everyone is as willing to trade barbs over a public health crisis. Bill Nelson, the senior senator from Florida and a Democrat, defended Rubio’s efforts to secure funding for Zika, and pointed out that Rubio was the only Senate Republican who supported meeting Obama’s request in full. “Remember, he voted for the $1. 9bn, he was my   and he voted for the $1. 1bn with no riders,” Nelson said, while noting that voters would ultimately “see through the political machinations” on both sides. “The person that hasn’t delivered a Zika funding bill is Mitch McConnell,” he added.  Speaking on the Senate floor following the Zika vote, Rubio warned that Congress had arrived at a “moment of truth”. “How will history remember this moment 20 years from now if  —   God forbid  —   there are hundreds or even thousands of children who were born with microcephaly while we stood here, playing politics, and did nothing?” he said. “This has the potential to tarnish the legacy of our generation of national leaders  —   and, far worse, to cause grave health challenges for an untold number of Americans. ”

Possible Romney appointment provokes ’deluge’ of opposition, says Trump aide
Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway has highlighted the opposition to former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney becoming secretary of state. Romney has emerged as one of the frontrunners for the position, despite criticisms he had made about Trump in the past. In a tweet earlier on Thursday, Conway drew attention to what she described as a “deluge of social media  private comms re: Romney Some Trump loyalists warn against Romney as sec of state”. Conway appeared to be referring to comments by former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and former House speaker Newt Gingrich that questioned how loyal Romney, who was the Republican nominee for president in 2012, could be to Trump. In a second tweet she added that previous secretaries of state such as Henry Kissinger and George Shultz “flew around the world less, counseled POTUS close to home more. And were loyal. Good checklist. ”  Trump’s decision over the state department is widely considered to be a heated battle between Romney supporters and those, like Huckabee and Gingrich, who favor the former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani.  A third group is said to be pressing for the search for an alternative to continue.  In comments on Wednesday, Huckabee warned that appointments of disloyal Republicans could prove to be a distraction to Trump.  “It’s not about that I don’t care for Mitt personally, but I’m still very unhappy that Mitt did everything he could to derail Donald Trump,” Huckabee told Fox News. “He attacked him on a personal level about his character, integrity, his honor. ” At the Republican convention in July, Romney attempted to induce voters to cast their primary ballot for whichever Republican could beat Trump. In March, he called Trump a “phony” and dissed Trump’s business acumen. “A business genius he is not,” Romney said, adding that Trump’s “promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University”. Trump countered that Romney was a failed candidate who would have “dropped to his knees” for his endorsement.  Gingrich, meanwhile, offered that the only way Romney could be considered for an administration post would be if he publicly repudiated every criticism he had made of Trump. The former House speaker said Romney was the “most vicious and most explicit opponent all through the campaign on the Republican side”. “I think as the new president, to build the team he wants to build, but I would suggest there are a lot of other people who are more qualified than Romney in foreign policy and who also have not been as actively hostile as he’s been. ” After Trump met with Romney last weekend, Trump’s transition team described the meeting as an “extremely positive and productive conversation”.

’I’m no threat’ – will Obama pardon one of the world’s longest-serving political prisoners?
Any day now, monarch butterflies will begin their epic migration from Canada to Mexico. It is one of the wonders of the world: insects whose distinctive orange and black wings barely stretch four inches flying on thermal currents up to 3, 000 miles in search of a warm spot to spend the winter. The phenomenon has entranced Oscar López Rivera since his childhood days in rural Puerto Rico. If he ever gets the chance, he says, one of his great ambitions is to trace the monarchs’ route, all the way from the Canadian border, across the US great plains into northern Mexico. “The monarch is fascinating to me,” he says. “The length of their journey and what they do to survive: how can an insect so small go so far?” That’s an achingly powerful question when you consider who is posing it. For the past 35 years, López Rivera has been unable to fly, his wings clipped. He has been held in federal institutions, for 12 of those years totally alone inside a    concrete box from which he had no view of the sky. The last time he saw a live butterfly, let alone a monarch, was in 1981. López Rivera is one of the US’s, and the world’s,   political prisoners. Aged 73, he has spent more than half his life behind bars. He is convicted of killing no one, of hurting no one. His crime was “seditious conspiracy”  —   plotting against the US state in the furtherance of Puerto Rican independence. He still believes in what he calls that “noble cause”: full sovereignty for his Caribbean birthplace that is classified as a US “territory”. But his views on how to attain that goal have changed. Two decades ago he and his fellow Puerto Rican independence fighters renounced violence and embraced peaceful political reform. The last year in which the militant group to which he belonged committed a violent act was 1983. Yet there he still sits in his prison cell, reading and painting, the last of his kind locked up, so venerable that other prisoners call him “El Viejo”  —   the Old One. It is as though he is stuck in a   trapped for ever in the headstrong 1970s, a   septuagenarian forced to dress up in floral shirt, flares and platform shoes dancing to Chic. The world, and López Rivera with it, has moved on, but the US government continues to see him through the prism of a bygone age.  Unless someone intervenes to release him, he will remain in captivity until 26 June 2023, five months after his 80th birthday. Fortunately for López Rivera, there is such a person who holds the power of clemency: Barack Obama. As the US president prepares to quit the White House, he is drawing up his final pardon list, presenting the prisoner with a slender hope. Many prominent supporters are lobbying hard for the pardon. They make for an impressive list: Archbishop Desmond Tutu the governor of Puerto Rico, Alejandro García Padilla the Hispanic caucus of the US Congress former US president Jimmy Carter Democratic presidential   Bernie Sanders and the creator of the smash Broadway musical Hamilton,   Miranda, who confronted Obama about López Rivera face to face during a recent White House visit. On 9 October thousands of supporters gathered outside the White House bearing placards of the prisoner and calling on Obama to set him free, their voices projected across the mansion’s South Lawn in the hope that the president at work in the Oval Office might hear them and act accordingly. With friends like that, isn’t López Rivera a   for release? Not according to the man himself, who remains cautious about his chances. “I do not practise wishful thinking,” he begins in perfect English, delivered with a strong Puerto Rican accent. “It’s very difficult for me to read President Obama. The way he has been treated, the obstacles he has faced in the White House, makes him a little skittish about decisions. ” What a carefully weighted remark about something as visceral as his freedom. In the course of a   phone conversation (the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, having refused to allow the Guardian to visit him in person) it becomes clear that this is not artifice: the professorial tone is true to the man. López Rivera says he draws some optimism from Obama’s frequent expressions of admiration for Nelson Mandela. “He embraced Mandela as a great man, he saw that what Mandela did was important throughout the world. ” To invite comparison with Mandela may seem   for a man who in the US is relatively little known, but back home López Rivera is often cast as the “Mandela of Puerto Rico”. Mandela served 27 years in South African prisons for leading an   liberation struggle that deployed selective violence as a political tool López Rivera has already served eight years longer, arguably for doing the same thing. Mandela refused to renounce violence from his prison cell but López Rivera did so, some 20 years ago. López Rivera was born in 1943 in San Sebastián in the   of Puerto Rico. His childhood was spent living in the constitutional limbo that has defined the island since it was ceded to the US by Spain in 1898. Neither a sovereign country, nor the 51st state of the union, Puerto Rico is caught betwixt and between. Its people are US citizens, hold US passports, and can be drafted into the US military as López Rivera would soon discover. Yet when it comes to voting for the US president or a representative in the US Congress, a Puerto Rican is persona non grata. Quite rich, you might think, coming from a nation such as the US, which was founded upon the   principle of no taxation without representation. “The only thing we are good for is to be cannon fodder,” López Rivera says in a rare display of chagrin.  Not that he had a clue about any of that when he was growing up in San Sebastián and Chicago, where his family moved when he was 14. He was just an ordinary kid for whom the concepts of   or shrugging off the Yankee yoke were as alien as nuclear physics. “Before I got drafted I was a    Puerto Rican. I enjoyed life. I wasn’t paying attention to anything other than me. ” Then along came Vietnam. “I arrived thinking we were bringing freedom to Vietnamese people but as soon as I hit the ground I realised that wasn’t happening. We did sweeping operations lasting 30 days, getting villagers out of their homes, moving them off the rice paddies,   them. ” By the time he returned to Chicago a year later, sporting a Bronze Star for meritorious achievement, he says he had undergone a transformation. “I felt an obligation to change, to look at life from a totally different perspective. Now I could see what colonialism did to people. ” He threw himself into community work among the Puerto Ricans of Chicago. That brought him into contact with the families of imprisoned nationalists and, without ever suspecting that he would one day join their ranks, he was sucked into the movement and eventually became a member of the clandestine Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional. As the name suggested, the FALN believed armed force was justified as a means to an end. Between its foundation in 1974 and its effective demise in 1983 as a result of mass arrests, the FALN was said by prosecutors to have carried out about 140 bombings on military bases, government offices and financial buildings across the US, especially in Chicago and New York. Targets were chosen for being symbols of “Yankee imperialism” such as oil companies with offshore rigs in Puerto Rican waters. López Rivera insists that the focus was always on bricks and mortar, not people. “For me human life is sacred. We called it ‘armed propaganda’  —   using targets to draw attention to our struggle. ” That may have been the case, but the results were, to put it politely, inconsistent. In 1975 the group claimed responsibility for a bombing at the historic Fraunces Tavern in Lower Manhattan, the scene of George Washington’s farewell to troops after the American revolution. The attack killed four people and injured more than 50. Two years later an employee at the Mobil building in New York was killed by another FALN device. López Rivera has denied involvement with these fatal attacks. But when I asked him if he ever committed acts of armed force such as planting a bomb, he replied: “I cannot comment on that. ” Interestingly, he still claims justification for violence under international law, using the present tense: “I believe we were adhering to international law that says that colonialism is a crime against humanity and that colonial people have a right to achieve   by any means, including force. ” But he is also adamant that the decision to renounce force was real and permanent. By 1990, the movement was already changing with the times. “We realised other tactics to armed force could be more effective, mobilising people through peaceful campaigning. Morally, also, we came to see that we had to lead by example, that if we are advocating for a better world then there are things you cannot do. You cannot get a better world by being unjust yourself. ” When I ask him if he would pose a threat to the public were Obama to set him free, he replies: “I don’t think I could be a threat. We have transcended violence  —   it’s crucial for people to understand, we’re not advocating anything that would be a threat to anyone. ” He was picked up in 1981 at a traffic stop in Chicago and charged with seditious conspiracy  —   a very rare count of plotting against the US state that was first used after the civil war against southern refuseniks and then applied to anarchists and socialists before being turned against Puerto Rican independistas like himself.  At trial, prosecutors presented no evidence that tied him to any deaths or injuries, or even specific attacks. For his part, he and his comrades refused to recognise the judicial process, calling himself a prisoner of war, offering no defence and declining even to attend the trial. He still describes seditious conspiracy as an “impossible crime”. He told me: “How can a Puerto Rican be seditious towards the US state when we never had any part in electing a US government?” He was sentenced to 55 years. By contrast, as his lawyer Jan Susler has pointed out, the average federal sentence for murder in 1981 was 10. 3 years. Later, his sentence was extended to 70 years when, he insists, he was framed by agents provocateurs planted in his cell who cooked up a plot to escape and then implicated him in it. In a less disciplined individual, such harsh treatment would inevitably spawn bitterness and despair. Not for López Rivera. He recounts his time in prison with verve bordering on enthusiasm. Yes, he has faced “terrible times” been labelled a terrorist by prison guards, called a “spic” and worse. But he has always made use of his life of incarceration, he says. “When I first got to prison I made myself a promise: they can lock me up, but the time I spend in prison is my time. I use it to my own advantage, for my own goals. From the moment I get up to the moment I go to bed, I keep active. ” That means rising at 4am to an exercise regime of 40 minutes of stretching,   and   sidewinders and upper body routines. He reads a lot. Currently, he’s reading Edward Said’s Orientalism, and before that he devoured the New Yorker writer Jane Mayer’s book on billionaire rightwing donors, Dark Money. He teaches other inmates to read and write or speak Spanish. He also likes to paint as a way of “taking myself out of prison into the outside world”. He uses as his template photographs of landscapes or seascapes that he tears from magazines, making up for his lack of access to the natural world. He caught the painting bug after the alleged escape plot when he was put into solitary confinement in two of the toughest supermax prisons in the US: Marion, Illinois, and Florence, Colorado. He would spend all but two hours a week in his concrete cell with no sight of the sky. “Little by little, colours start to fade. Your eyes begin to change how you see things. You see less colour everything blurs into the   of the cell walls. ” So he turned to painting as a way to bring colour back into his life. That’s when he rediscovered his passion for the monarch butterfly, reproducing pictures of the insects as a reflection on their migration. “I had to be strong. I always thought they were not going to destroy me, that was not going to happen. ” Though he is now out of solitary he has still had to deal with social deprivation. At its peak, he was one of two dozen independistas in federal prisons now he is the last one. Over the years, he has seen his comrades walk free, their ranks gradually depleted, until in 2010 he became the only one left. He is sanguine about that. “I have never felt abandoned or lonely. There is no regret inside my heart. ” To have no regret about his predicament is all the more extraordinary in that he could have been released in 2009. In August 1999, Bill Clinton did what López Rivera’s supporters are now urging Obama to do: he used his final days in office to grant a presidential pardon to 11 Puerto Rican independence fighters. López Rivera was offered a lesser deal that would have seen him released after a decade, but he turned it down, because he says he had no faith in the US government sticking to its side of the bargain and he was unhappy about a couple of his fellow fighters being offered no commutation at all. “When I was in Vietnam I never left anyone behind. That’s not my practice, I couldn’t do it,” he says. Surely he must have had moments in the past seven years when he has questioned his rejection of the deal that would have set him free? “None whatsoever. I believe in principles. For me, the decision was the one I had to make. ” So what now is the likelihood that Obama will follow in Clinton’s footsteps and finally fling open the cell doors? One factor in Obama’s calculation might be that Clinton’s round of pardons sparked a fireball of opposition in Congress and the media. The “Clinton terror pardons” remain a bugbear for the right to this day, even though the vitriol overlooks one awkward fact about the releases: that not a single criminal act has been committed by any of the 11 former FALN militants in the 16 years that they have been out. The Clinton backlash perhaps explains Obama’s apparent ambivalence on the matter. He is reported to have told   Miranda that López Rivera’s clemency petition was “on his desk”. But Congress member Luis Gutiérrez, who is of Puerto Rican descent and has been a leading proponent of a pardon, has said that when he asked Obama about the account the president firmly disputed it and gave a bland statement that “procedures must be followed”. That sounds less than promising for the Mandela of Puerto Rico. But López Rivera responds to the mixed messages emanating from the White House with trademark composure. “I have no choice but to be optimistic,” he says, as the Terre Haute guards call time on our conversation. “Hope, that is one thing we can never lose. ”

Kanye West’s travails help hip-hop open up on mental health
In the final shot of Kanye West’s video for his 2008 track Love Lockdown the rapper curls up into a foetal position in the middle of a bright white room, his head clutched desperately in his hands. It is a moment of vulnerability many might see as being at odds with the antagonistic,   megastar, who declares himself a god, has snatched awards from the hands of Taylor Swift and makes dramatic outbursts on television chat shows. Yet this week, as news broke of the singer’s hospitalisation in the psychiatric ward of UCLA, reportedly for stress and exhaustion following a week of erratic behaviour on stage and the subsequent cancellation of his tour, the pressures on   artists to conceal mental health vulnerabilities have come under almost unprecedented scrutiny. West’s hospitalisation comes at a pivotal time for  ’s complex relationship with mental health. Rather than distancing themselves from West’s possible mental health issues, fellow musicians such as Chance the Rapper, West’s recent collaborator, told the BBC he wanted to “extend a special prayer to my big brother Kanye West”.     producer 9th Wonder tweeted:  These responses suggest attitudes, and stigmas, are changing. The macho and often adversarial culture of   coupled with the fact that African American men are significantly less likely to seek help for mental health issues, has meant, in the public arena at least, it was rarely discussed. That is not to say it has been ignored entirely. Dr Akeem Sule, a consultant psychiatrist, and Dr Becky Inkster, a clinical neuroscientist, both at the University of Cambridge, recently set up an initiative, Hip Hop Psych, after their academic research proved how much   lyrics can help people open up about their own mental health issues. “We have to look to the origins of   to really understand how much mental health has always been at its core,” said Sule and Inkster. “It developed in the mid 70s in the South Bronx, where gangs were roaming the streets, there was a drug epidemic, there was extreme poverty, a housing crisis. You throw in absent fathers, losing family to crime, people with no support all those are ingredients for mental health problems. ” The pair pointed to songs such as Tupac Shakur’s So Many Tears, where he speaks about the impact his environment has on his own mental health and the struggles he has coping, as well as Geto Boys’   track Mind Playing Tricks on Me, which is widely acknowledged to be about psychosis. However, the disparity, Sule and Inkster pointed out, was that while the lyrics documented struggle and depression, it was a very different story when it came to artists giving interviews or performing. “There was this very masculine culture of   where you had to be resilient and you couldn’t show any signs of weakness,” said Sule and Inkster. “While the lyrics spoke of mental health problems covertly, there was a stigma, particularly with the black men living in these communities where rap and   was emerging from, about saying outright ‘I have depression’ or addressing mental health issues. ” But, as the conversation around mental health in the music industry has opened up over the past couple of years, particularly over the psychological toll of being in the public eye,   had “evolved and started owning depression as something other than a sign of weakness,” said Sule and Inkster. In October, Ohio rapper Kid Cudi, made a public statement to say he had been hospitalised and admitted “anxiety and depression have ruled my life for as long as I can remember”. “Its been difficult for me to find the words to what I’m about to share with you because I feel ashamed,” he wrote. “Yesterday I checked myself into rehab for depression and suicidal urges   …     I’m scared, I’m sad, I feel like I let a lot of people down and again, I’m sorry. It’s time I fix me. I’m nervous but   …     [I’m going to] get through this. ” The wave of support that Kid Cudi received from some of the biggest names in   from A$AP Rocky and Travis Scott to Wiz Khalifa and even West himself  —   and the fact it gave rise to trending hashtag #YouGoodMan as a way to discuss race, masculinity and depression  —   was a clear indicator that the mental health stigma in   is dissipating. According to Inkster and Sule it was a conversation that began to open up in 2011 when DMX admitted that many of his public struggles with addiction and crime were related to his bipolar disorder. More recently, it has been evident in rapper J Cole talking publicly about his struggle with depression, and fronting the #OKNotToBeOK campaign and in   Chicago rapper Vic Mensa’s recent comments about his own suppressed mental health issues. “Mental health is something that a lot of people just aren’t ready to talk about, especially in the black community, especially black men. It’s very taboo, it’s very outside of the norm for black men to think it’s OK to see a therapist or anything like that,” said Mensa recently. Charles Hamilton, a rapper who emerged to great acclaim in 2009, going on to collaborate with Eminem among others, very publicly unravelled and was later sectioned due to bipolar disorder. Returning to the public eye last year, he too spoke openly about his mental health issues. “I just didn’t trust anybody. I didn’t leave my house, I just made music all the time. I was fighting depression, I shut myself in,” he admitted. “I wanted to commit career suicide, physical suicide, spiritual suicide, I didn’t care anymore. ” Yet for Inkster and Sule, the most significant figure breaking down this stigma around depression and revealing weakness is Kendrick Lamar. Arguably the world’s biggest   artist, they said Lamar’s public discussion of the inner demons and survivors’ guilt that fuelled his   album, To Pimp a Butterfly, have proved that depression is no longer perceived as a fallacy in the rap community. “Back in the early days of   that would never happen,” they said. “Yes, there are still braggadocio lyrics and attitudes but I would say   has made great strides. ”

’One week left’ to pass Zika funding bill in US House, Democrats warn
The head of the Centers for Disease Control, congressional Democrats and the    at the Department of Homeland Security called for Republicans to bring a Zika funding bill to the floor  —   again. The call comes two weeks after a measure passed the House around 3am, loaded with unrelated provisions Democrats called “poison pills” and after the Senate attempted to advance a $1. 1bn bill.  “We’ve got one week left,” said Kathy Castor, a Democratic representative for the Tampa Bay area, along Florida’s Gulf Coast. The locality is at high risk for transmission of the disease. “One week left  —   and if Speaker [Paul] Ryan cannot get a bill to the president’s desk it will be a colossal failure to address a crisis. ”  The subtropical,   virus can cause children to be born with abnormally small heads, a devastating birth defect known as microcephaly. Researchers know little about the disease: there is no cure, no vaccine and few diagnostic tools.   Knowledge about how to control the mosquitoes that transmit Zika is also limited. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is prevalent along America’s Gulf Coast, but is less susceptible as to common mosquito control methods than other species.  “Would you believe that just yesterday we had 11 new cases in Florida,” said Democratic senator Bill Nelson. He and fellow Floridian, Republican Marco Rubio, attempted to bring a $1. 9bn bill to the floor earlier this year. The new diagnoses, Nelson said, “brings the state’s total to 263, which includes 43 pregnant women”. “It’s been 136 days since the president requested just under $2bn in emergency funding,” Nelson said. “Compare that it took just 38 days to get $6bn for Ebola, and it took just 49 days to get $2bn to respond to the swine flu in 2009. ”  The race to compromise on a Zika measure comes about one week before Congress adjourns for the summer. The House leaves Washington at 3pm on 15 July. The   disease was first flagged as dangerous in January, the World Health Organization declared it an emergency by February. Barack Obama requested $1. 9bn in funding the same month.  The money was proposed to develop a vaccine, research risks the virus poses, develop tools to diagnose usually asymptomatic infections, research effective mosquito control, develop public education, family planning and provide funds to   communities for mosquito monitoring.  Now, at the height of mosquito season, more than 1, 100 people across the US have been diagnosed with Zika. All the cases are “travel associated” where people were infected outside of the US. However, public health officials have said repeatedly the disease could jump to American mosquitoes if a   individual is bitten.  Just two weeks ago, the House passed a bill to fund Zika, but the measure was rejected by Democrats because of   provisions. Among the “poison pills” Democrats said, was a $540m cut in funding to Obamacare and a deleted provision to stop the Confederate flag from flying at federal veterans cemeteries. In turn, Republicans accused Democrats of failing to pass the bill despite what they billed as beneficial measures to lift restrictions on certain pesticides.  The medical head of the March of Dimes, which seeks to improve   health, said the cost of caring for a child with microcephaly could be especially crushing, up to $10m per child, about 40 times the average cost estimated by the USDA.  “One hundred babies would be $1bn,” said Dr Ed McCabe. “We’re quibbling over the cost of 100 of these babies. This funding could save these tragedies from occurring. ” A majority of Republicans and Democrats polled by the Kaiser Family Foundation said they support Zika research, but surveyors called Americans’ understanding of the virus “uneven”. Of the 85% of Americans who have heard of Zika, just 13% said they are personally threatened by it (74% said the virus threatens pregnant women). “The only virtue in watching an infectious disease spread in slow motion is that it should give some places the advantage of time to prepare for it,” McCabe said. “The US is on the brink of squandering that advantage. ” Public health officials are particularly concerned about how the stalemate could affect Puerto Rico, where the virus has infected island mosquitoes, and already hamstrung by a debt crisis. The director of the CDC, Dr Tom Frieden, said public health officials believe up to 15 women per day are infected with the virus. “What we are seeing in Puerto Rico today is a very rapid increase in the level of infection,” said Frieden. “This is a great concern, it’s a silent epidemic,” he said, because of the lack of tools to diagnose new infections.  To date nearly 2, 500 people in Puerto Rico have been diagnosed with the disease, including 279 pregnant women. There, a campaign to spray the island for mosquitoes has resulted in protests, according to the Puerto Rican news agency Primera Hora.

Police and protesters clash during squatters’ rights protest in Berlin
More than 120 police officers were injured and 86 demonstrators detained during   riots in Berlin, which police have described as “the most aggressive and violent protests in the last five years”. Berlin police said in a statement on Sunday that protesters threw bottles, cobblestones and fireworks, destroyed cars and attacked officers, one of whom required hospital treatment. It wasn’t immediately clear how many rioters were injured. About 3, 500 protesters participated in the rallies, which started on Saturday evening and lasted until early on Sunday. Activists had called for the demonstration to protest against police operations at buildings inhabited by squatters in the eastern part of the German capital last month. About 1, 800 police officers were called in to monitor the protesters.

Buddy Ryan, NFL coach and defensive mastermind, dies at 82
Buddy Ryan, the pugnacious coach who masterminded two fierce defenses that won Super Bowl titles and whose twin sons are   NFL coaches, died Tuesday. He was 82. His death was confirmed by the Buffalo Bills, who are coached by Rex Ryan. James Solano, Buddy Ryan’s agent, said he died in Kentucky but did not give a cause. Ryan lived on a ranch in Shelbyville. “Buddy was a legend in our league in so many ways,” the Bills said in a statement. “His defenses were innovative and he was a master at putting his talented and tough players in a position to succeed. He was a real game changer, and much of his philosophies and defensive tactics are still utilized effectively by teams today. ” Ryan was a linebackers coach for the 1968 New York Jets and coordinated the   46 defense for the ‘85 Chicago Bears, one of the NFL’s greatest defenses. He was a head coach for the Philadelphia Eagles from   and for the Arizona Cardinals in   compiling a    overall record. A few years ago, Ryan attended a   game, traveling to New Jersey despite cancer to see   head coach Rex go against   defensive coordinator Rob. James David Ryan was a Korean War veteran who went to Oklahoma State, then earned a master’s degree from Middle Tennessee State even while coaching. He got his first major job in the pros in New York, then of the AFL, in 1968. Ryan was the linebackers coach for the Joe   Jets, a boastful, confident team that fit his personality. Those Jets led the AFL in defense in his first season on staff, then shocked the Colts in the Super Bowl,  . “That’s something my dad was very proud of,” Rex said. “When [former Jets coach Weeb] Ewbank hired him, he had to make a difference. If he felt he wasn’t making a difference, then his career as a professional coach would be short. ” Instead, it was very long. Ryan’s first job as a defensive coordinator came in 1976 with the Vikings under Bud Grant, like Ewbank a Hall of Fame coach. He spent two years there before moving to the rival Bears, where he concocted the 46 defense that overwhelmed the league with its aggressiveness and unpredictability. Ryan’s defenders, featuring such Hall of Famers as linebacker Mike Singletary and ends Dan Hampton and Richard Dent, came from all angles and was nearly impossible to budge on the ground. Not that teams had more success in the air, either. “Some say the 46 is just an   front,” said Ryan, who named the scheme after safety Doug Plank, who wore that number. “That’s like saying Marilyn Monroe is just a girl. ” Ryan and head coach Mike Ditka often feuded during that   season and Super Bowl run. They nearly slugged it out at halftime of Chicago’s only defeat, at Miami on a Monday night in December. (Ryan would punch offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride on national TV on 2 January 1994 when both were assistant coaches in Houston.) His work in Chicago got Ryan the Eagles job. At a meeting the night before the Bears beat New England in the 1986 Super Bowl, Dent said a teary Ryan informed his players that he was going to Philadelphia: “You guys are going to be my champions. Let’s kick some tail,” Ryan said. Hampton then kicked a film projector out of defensive line coach Dale Haupt’s hands, and defensive tackle Steve McMichael flung a chair across the room, its legs impaling a chalkboard. Such was the devotion players felt for Ryan, who guided the Eagles to the playoffs in 1988, ‘89 and ‘90. But they lost all three playoff games, and he was fired after the 1990 season by Eagles owner Norman Braman despite a    record. Earlier that season, Ryan bragged that his Eagles would so badly beat up the Redskins in a Monday night game “they’ll have to be carted off in body bags. ” The Eagles’ defense scored three touchdowns in a   win and knocked nine Redskins out of the game, including two quarterbacks. A year earlier, Philadelphia routed the Cowboys   on Thanksgiving Day with hardly any holiday feelings in the air. Cowboys kicker Luis Zendejas claimed Ryan put a $200 bounty on him, something Ryan laughed off as ridiculous. Arizona hired Ryan as head coach in 1994 and the Cardinals went   in his two years there. He never coached again, letting Rex and Rob carry on the family legacy. “Buddy’s influence will be carried on by defensive coaches for generations to come, but none more so than by Rex and Rob,” the Bills said. Ryan also is survived by another son, Jim, the Eagles said.

Lee Daniels on ’whiny’ #OscarsSoWhite controversy: ’Stop complaining’
    Lee Daniels has criticised the #OscarsSoWhite controversy, saying that people need to “stop complaining”. Daniels, whose film Precious made him only the second black director to have ever been nominated for an Oscar, has spoken about his frustration with those who claim the past two years of   nominees is a clear sign of industry racism. “Go out and do the work,” he said to the New York Times. “Oscars so white! So what? Do your work. Let your legacy speak and stop complaining, man. Are we really in this for the awards?” He also believes that a defeatist way of thinking about Hollywood would have prevented him from achieving success.  “If I had thought that way  —   that the world was against me  —   I wouldn’t be here now,” he said. “These whiny people that think we’re owed something are incomprehensible and reprehensible to me. I don’t expect acknowledgment or acceptance from white America. I’m going to be me. ” Daniels has since gone onto achieve success with the hit TV drama Empire and new show Star, for which he cast a white actor in the lead to help America feel more unified. “I felt that the country, instinctively, I thought, needed to heal,” he said in a recent interview. “And I thought that this white girl is so fabulous that black people will embrace her and white people will embrace her. ” The next set of Oscar nominations will be announced on 24 January, and experts are predicting a more diverse set of nominees with Moonlight, Fences and Hidden Figures all expected to be in the race.

Transgender stories: ’People think we wake up and decide to be trans’
Nikki Hayden, 26, psychology student, London, Until I was about four or five I didn’t know I wasn’t a girl, to be honest with you. One of my earliest memories, about five years old, was being yelled at by a teacher for going to the toilet with the girls. About the same age I realised I was different to these other boys. At the age of nine I refused to have my hair cut. I didn’t have it cut until I was 16, because having it cut was such a torment to me. School was extremely difficult. I got bullied a lot. I was picked on for being too thin, for being feminine, for not liking football, for hanging round with girls, for having long hair. They mocked everything they could think of in terms of gender and sexuality. I learned what trans meant through YouTube. I knew how I felt but I didn’t know there was a term for it. I was basically just trying to Google what I felt. A lightbulb went off in my head and I thought, this explains all the issues I’ve had as long as I can remember. I never really told my family. They know, but I just started transitioning. I never said: “Oh, by the way   …    ” My mum asked me if I was transgender when I was around 19 after I’d already transitioned. She said: “Well, are you?” And I was like: “Are you blind?” On a    basis I don’t tell people I’m transgender. The thing about trans people is, we feel very normal. It’s the way we are, it’s only when people say you’re not normal that you feel that way. I’ve always been extremely feminine, I always felt that way. I can’t say that I ever felt like a boy, I just had to live as a boy for the first 16 years of my life. Trans people are the same as everyone else, our ideals in life are to be happy, to be respected, to be comfortable. I’ve had people who have openly said to me that they’ve had prejudices around trans people but as soon as they’ve met me they’ve understood more  —   it’s who I am and the way that I was born. There’s no real difference between myself and people who are cisgender [ ]. Keith Reynolds, 18, student, Surrey, A lot of people have it in their head that we wake up and decide to be trans. I want people to know that it’s not a choice. Nothing has happened in my life to make me trans. I was born trans. I told my mum when I was about 13. She was shocked and didn’t really understand. Then six months later she told my dad and he was so angry. I love my dad but he was a very traditional person. There was a lot of tension. I couldn’t wear men’s clothing, or I couldn’t wear men’s deodorant  —   it would cause an argument. It started to get better, but then Dad got cancer. He died a week before I turned 16. When he got sick we didn’t talk about it any more. I thought that once he had recovered we’d go back to talking about it, but he didn’t recover. After my dad died I found a book about transgender young people and I gave it to my mum. She read it and it was a complete change. She says her main thing and also my dad’s main thing is they were worried about how it will affect me in life  —   will I be able to find a job, will I be able to find a partner. Well, those things have happened: I’ve found a partner, I have no trouble finding jobs. My mum is fantastic, she’s really proud of me. She comes to Transgender Pride with me, if anybody says anything bad about me being trans she’s ready to hammer them. She makes me the envy of many trans people, I think. I was referred to Tavistock [the clinic for children and adolescents] in May 2014. You’re not allowed testosterone until you’ve been on hormone blockers for a year at Tavistock. But I was 16 at my first appointment and had already gone through puberty, and knew that by the time I had done a year on blockers I’d be picked up by the adult clinics. I decided not to go on hormone blockers, because it wouldn’t really do much for me. I was referred to an adult clinic in May 2015. I still haven’t had an appointment, which means I haven’t had any medical intervention in three years. I’m desperate for hormones and surgery. My dysphoria makes me feel like I’m embarrassed for people to look at me. In my head I’m this weird thing that is ugly. I have to wear baggy clothes to hide my hips, I have to think about how many layers I have to wear to hide my chest. I really understand that the NHS is overstretched because there’s a sudden influx of people being referred. I completely understand why, but that doesn’t stop the frustration.   Knan, 40s, project manager for Liberal Judaism, London, I didn’t really know anything about gender identity until quite late, when I was in my  . I also come from a secular Jewish family, so I didn’t know much about what it means to be Jewish either.  I identify as    . Being trans and Jewish seemed a complete oxymoron. I thought, it can’t be, I have to decide between them. But I had this wonderful community here to give me all that space and time to come out. I feel very blessed that everyone, including family and friends, have been extremely supportive throughout. I haven’t had to go through what many trans people have to go through. Years ago when I came out I went to the wall [Western Wall in Jerusalem]. There are three sections  —   the male section, the female section and an ungendered section. Now I would probably go to the ungendered section, but it was my first time presenting as male in such a holy place and I went to the male section of the wall. It made me so happy to do that, to go to the part of the wall I wanted to. I was transitioning medically and spiritually and it was one of the most important moments of my life. A Jewish online magazine reported on that and it sparked off online, I got really abusive messages. I thought, these people don’t know me, I don’t think anyone should be able to tell you who you are and how to live your life. Yourself is yourself, even in the religious community.  A lot of people from mainstream trans communities ask me, how can you be a person of faith, because even your own religion has been so horrible to LGBT people in general and trans people specifically? That’s true. But it’s about what faith means and leaving out what some leaders and institutions do with it.  In the media, the focus is often on the pathology and medical transitioning and that’s a big part of it, but there are so many layers of what it means to be trans. It’s almost like trans people are   they are just these people who need medical help. I do hope we will change our view on what trans looks like. It’s not just something on the outside, it’s something that’s very deep and spiritual. We are created in the image of God. I am part of that as a trans Jew.   Bishop OBE, 70, retired sales manager, scientific instrumentation, Rhyl, Wales  I knew I was trans from about three or four years old. From a very early age I thought one day I’ll wake up and my body will be like my sisters’ and my parents would say: “Oh, we had a girl, not a boy as we thought. ” When I went to university I learned about transsexuals and that some of them transitioned. I brought this up with my tutors and they said: “People like you don’t do that. ” They said: “Just get married and it’ll all go away. ” That was the perceived wisdom then  —   they told gay and lesbian people the same thing. So I was persuaded that I should get married. Within three or four months I told my ex how I felt and initially she was very supportive. I used to go to a support group once a week I’d have a weekend out once a month where I’d get dressed up and go clubbing with some other girls in Manchester. I had to travel a lot for work, which gave me opportunities to be myself. These coping strategies kept me going through about 30 years of marriage. When they found out at work I’d regularly lose my job. It’s happened five times, most recently after the equality legislation had been passed. One time, very early on, I was coming back from my support group at night. I got stopped by police at a routine roadblock. The officer asked if I was allowed to drive a company vehicle dressed like that and called my work to tell them I was dressed like a woman. I had one job where they got rid of me and then they wrote to every company I applied to and said: “Don’t employ this person, they’re trans. ” Each time I lost my job we had to move. The last time it happened my wife wouldn’t move any more  —   that’s what really ended our marriage. When I transitioned   [in 2007] we had difficulties like having the car regularly damaged and having “the trannies live here” painted on the house. When I moved to north Wales to live with my trans partner, Elen, no one knew me as anyone else, so almost all the abuse stopped. Elen and I got married in 2011. There’s still so much to do, but there have been huge improvements in acceptance. There is much more legislation to support us, particularly in the last few years. That night I got outed by the police officer, I wouldn’t have even dared go into the police station as myself. Now I go in and have lunch with the assistant chief constable or the police and crime commissioner to discuss combating transphobic hate crime. J Fernandez, 23, administrative assistant, London,  The people you see in the media are usually one type of trans person. They’re usually binary [identify as either female or male] they usually pass [as someone of that gender] they’re usually white and they usually have this narrative that they’ve always known they’re the “wrong gender”. It makes other trans people scared to tell their stories.    people are people who don’t identify as male or female all the time. There are lots of subsections  —   you might be agender, gender fluid,   a   or a  . You might not understand the nuances of the differences, but everyone is always making up new identities to match their experiences and that can only be a good thing. While it can be confusing, it’s better than saying you can only be this thing and we won’t talk about anything else.  I just identify as   and don’t put myself into any sub identity. Some days I like to be a woman and I’m also OK with identifying as being a guy. I’m pretty much nothing at the moment. I came out as a trans guy and transitioned. I took testosterone, I’ve had top surgery [chest reduction] and then a hysterectomy in 2015. The hormones and surgery is about aligning my body to what it should have been at birth. Being born with the correct parts would have made things easier, but at the same time I don’t want to be told that my body is wrong.  It’s very difficult to get treatment as a   person. They were dismissive about the fact that I was feminine.   people are used to it, you are warned when you go in [to the gender clinics] if you want treatment you will have to present as male or female and stick to that story. I don’t want to be part of any mainstream [ ] movement if it doesn’t include   people. In terms of celebrity, there needs to be a lot more diversity. It’s a circle: people don’t come out if they don’t see anyone like them. I’m  : my mum is Spanish and Nigerian. I am still finding out how I connect with an identity apart from a western LGBT identity. That’s something I’m still working on. Within the religion indigenous to the Yoruba people [an ethnic group in Nigeria] there a lot of gender fluid deities as a trans person trying to find my roots, that’s one part of my heritage that I feel positive about.

Rolling Stone ’Jackie’ trial: university administrator awarded $3m for defamation
Jurors have awarded a University of Virginia administrator $3m for her portrayal in a   Rolling Stone magazine article about the school’s handling of a brutal gang rape a fraternity house. The   jury’s decision came after they concluded on Friday that the magazine, its publisher and reporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely were responsible for defamation, with actual malice, of former associate dean of students Nicole Eramo in the 2014 story A Rape on Campus. Eramo sued the magazine for $7. 5m, claiming it cast her as a villain who sought to discourage the woman identified only as Jackie from reporting her alleged assault to police. A police investigation found no evidence to back up Jackie’s rape claims. Jurors heard testimony on Monday about the extent to which the story has damaged Eramo’s life and reputation before they began deliberating to decide how much to award her in damages. Eramo told jurors that after the story’s publication, she had trouble sleeping, feared for her safety and struggled with how to explain what was happening to her     son. One day, she crawled under her desk and contemplated suicide as she felt her world come crashing down around her, she said. Her husband testified that she told him: “I don’t know that I can live anymore. ” “I just wanted to disappear,” said Eramo, who cried throughout much of her testimony. “I didn’t know how it was going to be OK. ” She claimed the article prompted the university to move her out of her job as an associate dean into a different administrative role that she doesn’t like as much because she rarely works with students. When the article was published, she was also preparing to undergo a double mastectomy for breast cancer. Eramo and her attorneys suggested that the stress she was under could have contributed to a   infection that led to a hospital stay. “Even the strongest people have a breaking point,” said Tom Clare, an attorney for Eramo. The story roiled the University of Virginia campus, prompted calls for Eramo’s resignation and sparked a national conversation about sexual assault at elite institutions. Jackie’s story quickly fell apart after reporters from other outlets started asking questions and determined that Rolling Stone never spoke to the woman’s alleged attackers  —   or even verified their existence  —   before going to print. Because the judge determined that Eramo was a public figure, she had to prove Rolling Stone made statements with “actual malice,” meaning it knew that what it was writing about her was false or entertained serious doubts about whether it might be true. Jurors found that the magazine and its publisher, Wenner Media, acted with actual malice because they republished the article on 5 December with an editor’s note after they knew about the problems with Jackie’s story. The jury also found that Erdely acted with actual malice on six claims: two statements in the article and four statements to media outlets after the story was published. Jurors awarded $2m to Eramo for statements made by Erdely and $1m for the republication of the article by Rolling Stone and Wenner Media. Rolling Stone could appeal the verdict. Rolling Stone has agreed to pay Erdely’s legal costs and the damages levied against her. Rolling Stone’s attorneys argued throughout the   trial that while it may have been a mistake to trust Jackie, their portrayal of the university and Eramo was fair and accurate. On Monday, attorney David Paxton told jurors that the magazine was “heartbroken” by Friday’s decision and urged them not to be tempted to award a large sum of damages in order to send a message to the magazine and the media. They’ve already done that with their verdict, Paxton said. “This was tough medicine to receive,” Paxton said. Paxton apologized to Eramo, but stressed that Eramo not only kept a job at the university after the article was published, but she received a pay raise. In their damages defense, attorneys for Rolling Stone showed jurors just one exhibit: A 2015 Office of Civil Rights report that criticizes the university’s handling of sexual assault complaints and specifically mentions that Eramo helped to create a “hostile environment” for victims on campus. Rolling Stone also faces a $25m lawsuit from Phi Kappa Psi, the fraternity where Jackie claimed her assault took place. That case is schedule to go to trial late next year.

Sausage Party review – Seth Rogen’s surprisingly tasty supermarket sweep
Talk about fresh. Seth Rogen’s naughty food cartoon Sausage Party is, like much of his best work, deceptive packaging. The script he and his usual collaborator Evan Goldberg have written (in conjunction with Kyle Hunter and Ariel Shaffir) seems, at first, to trade solely on anthropomorphised food using profanity on supermarket shelves. This is mildly amusing at first but, like a bun out of its Cellophane, threatens to go stale. That’s when a jar of honey mustard gets returned. The supermarket is what Erving Goffman might call a total institution. Its occupants (food from around the world) are kept compliant by an unprovable belief system. If they are good and obey the gods, they will one day be chosen and taken to the “Great Beyond” (outside the gleaming automated doors in a cart.) But they will only get picked if they remain pure of spirit the “unfresh” get tossed into a dusty bin by a sadist tormentor (actually just a teen bored with his job.) This fear prevents sausages and buns from getting intimate, despite their urges to conjoin. This is all preposterous, but stick with it it’s just the tip of surprisingly thorough   in this   comedy. Our lead sausage Frank (voiced by Rogen) is upbeat, cheery and randy for his shelfmate Brenda (Kristen Wiig) a bun who returns his affection. All is well at the store, with the happy food singing songs of praise to the gods who will one day scoop them up. (Unlike Toy Story, where humans are never around to catch the living toys, humans just can’t see the true reality.) But when that shellshocked honey mustard (Danny McBride) returns with stories of the gods actually being bloodthirsty monsters, things start to change. The first of a number of extraordinary   comes when our heroes end up selected (yay!) but an overturned cart leads to chaos. A punctured bag of white flour provides a    cloud. There is a shocking amount of proper, terrorising fear during this and subsequent scenes. There has to be for the comedy to work. I’d personally be OK allowing children to see the goofy prurience in this film, but it’s the horrific imagery (some of which apes Saving Private Ryan) that might freak a kid out. Disrupted, Frank and Brenda must get back to their aisle in the hopes of repackaging themselves without getting tossed. On their march they are joined by a Jewish bagel (Edward Norton doing the most    Woody Allen impersonation since Rick Moranis) and an Arabic lavash (David Krumholtz) whose belief in the Great Beyond includes being doused in 77 bottles of virgin olive oil. The pair bicker (“You’ve even occupied the West Bank of the aisle! ”) and as the foursome make tracks, they discover they are being hunted by an angry vaginal douche. The douche, sleazily voiced by Nick Kroll, is a play on    . (Yes, there’s a scene where he gets “juiced. ”) Racial stereotypes await on every aisle, which will undoubtedly be a third rail for some viewers. My attitude is that if you want to play in that sandbox, you have to be sure to insult everyone and, more importantly, make sure the jokes work. Sausage Party features an adorable potato (with googly eyes all over its body!) happily singing Danny Boy, then, just before a surprise peeling, shouting, “Jaysus Fook!” I dunno   …     there are some things in this world that are beautiful. There’s a lot that’s goofy in Sausage Party, like when a doper on bath salts can suddenly see and hear the living food in his house, and a Stephen   piece of   bubblegum, but there is (I swear) a richer message, too. This is a     story that is vehemently against the corruption found in organised religion, but not in a    “atheist”      Gervais kind of way. In fact, if there’s any message in the movie, it’s that even if you think someone else is being dumb, you aren’t going to win them over by rubbing their noses in their stupidity. Something to consider right now as we get closer to an election where one candidate’s supporters seem too stupid to tie their own shoes. And another message: everyone would probably be happier if they were screwing. Sausage Party is a movie with an extended climax, and before the final ending there’s an already much discussed “food orgy” that, no joke, is something you need to see to believe. The whole thing is so tasty, you may just want seconds.

Georgetown’s attempt at atonement: should we be grateful?
Slavery is a footnote in the history of many universities in the United States. Mostly, that’s where it stays. But not for Georgetown, which sold 272 slaves in 1838. The university wants to come to terms with its past and take the abstract concepts of reconciliation and redemption and make them tangible. Will they succeed? In their announcement, I heard the buzzwords “diversity” and “inclusion” several times, and those trend words put me on edge. Organizations use those terms all the time and little comes from the effort to make elitist and exclusionary circles more accessible. I was also turned off by the school’s decision to grant the slaves’ descendants legacy access without any guaranteed financial support. The arrangement means that even if an applicant and his or her family are able to overcome many of the systemic and institutional injustices that African Americans faced in the wake of slavery, the chance to attend Georgetown might still be compromised due to finances. I know it is impossible to place a price tag on demoralization and dehumanization. There is no calculator that can account for the cultural and economic legacies of slavery and discrimination. Yet every couple years there’s the talk of reparations. A recent article by Yes! Magazine estimates that the “40 acres and a mule” promise would be worth $6. 4tn. But we are far off from seriously considering that kind of justice.  So do we take what atonement we can get and then hold institutions accountable? In a world where white students are ready to challenge affirmative action, and people question racism’s existence even as we watch people being shot and murdered for misdemeanors, that might be the pragmatic approach. Georgetown’s decision could forever change the way we talk about inheritance, legacy and community. The university has decided to invest part of its endowment in unpacking the complex issue of slavery, and the racial inequality the system of selling human cargo created. The move could cause other educational and cultural giants to assess their privilege and question their historical and cultural competency.  Imagine what we could accomplish as a community, and as a nation, if we spent time reflecting upon our country’s darker historical moments as tool to create a better future. Would the world implode if we were able to recognize that slavery was part of the social order, the social construct that our systems were built upon? No. But it would give our current system a strong and   shake.  After all, people argued with Michelle Obama when she mentioned that the White House was built by slaves, without knowing that it actually was. And Colin Kaepernick catches flack for his decision to sit during the national anthem to protest the treatment of minorities in the US. But few of his critics know that the lyricist of The Star Spangled Banner, Francis Scott Key, was a slaveholder when the song was composed in 1814. We need this because many in the US are ready to join the debate about the burkini ban, forgetting that just a few decade ago, African Americans weren’t allowed to swim in public pools. Does an admission like Georgetown’s fill the desire for healing and reconciliation that the nation needs? Maybe not, but it is the start to a   conversation.

Chicago man killed while live streaming video on Facebook Live
A Chicago man was shot and killed while live streaming a video on Facebook, police said on Friday, just days after a double homicide in France in which the killer later took to Facebook Live to encourage more violence. Antonio Perkins, 28, was found face down on Wednesday night in a vacant lot with gunshot wounds to the neck and head on the city’s west side, Chicago police officer Laura Amezaga said.  Perkins was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. Police on Friday identified the man in the video as Perkins, who they said was a documented gang member. No arrests have been made.  In France, a    man killed a French police commander and the commander’s partner on Tuesday, then he took to Facebook Live with a   video encouraging followers to kill prison staff, police officials, journalists and lawmakers. The incidents underscore the immense challenges companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Google’s YouTube face as they push live video streaming to hundreds of millions of people.  Facebook in recent months has made its Live feature  —   which allows anyone to broadcast a video in real time  —   a central component of its strategy. It allows people to stream from their smartphone.  Chicago, the   US city, has drawn attention due to its gun violence, which police have blamed largely on gang violence and a proliferation of stolen guns. There were nearly 500 homicides last year, and gun violence is up in 2016, police say.  The Facebook Live video appears to show Perkins recording himself and a group of people in front of a row of homes before someone opened fire. The phone appears to tumble through bloody grass before going black. The audio continues with bystanders screaming and crying.  The video remains on Facebook with a user warning message about its graphic nature.  A spokeswoman from Facebook acknowledged the video posting, saying it does not violate company policy. The social media site will remove a video if it celebrates or glorifies violence, she said.

Nate Parker: director with a back story
When Nate Parker “arrived” with the screening of his film The Birth of a Nation at the Sundance festival in January, the timing couldn’t have been more urgent. Ten days before its unveiling, #OscarsSoWhite had begun to trend again on Twitter. For the second year in a row, no actors of colour were nominated for an Academy Award. Here was an   picture from a   African American film‑maker, featuring a mostly black cast, and centring on Nat Turner, a former slave who led a brutally violent revolt in 1831 to free slaves in Virginia. The film had the potential to seize the moment  —   and it did. The Sundance screening was key. Parker had ensured that cast, crew, friends and family made the trek to Park City, Utah, for his film’s premiere. Their energy was felt in the room. Before the screening even got under way, the crowd stood as soon as Parker’s name was called. Once it concluded, a second, and much longer, ovation followed, with many in attendance seen drying their tears. Immediate reactions on Twitter were ecstatic. A bidding war between the hottest arthouse distributors followed. Fox Searchlight, the company that led the similarly themed 12 Years a Slave to a best picture Oscar win in 2014, was the victor, purportedly beating Netflix to land the film for $17. 5m (a colossal amount by Sundance standards). Its aim in spending so much was clear: The Birth of a Nation would be their great Oscar hope. It came as no surprise when the film won the grand jury prize as well as the audience award no other selection came close to matching its impact on the industry during the   span of the festival. It seemed nothing could possibly derail’s Parker’s rise from   actor to Hollywood’s new hope. Imagine, then, the shockwaves that reverberated through Hollywood when Parker publicly addressed a rape trial from his college years in two trade interviews tied to his impending awards campaign. Before he spoke out about the 1999 incident to Variety and Deadline, two of Hollywood’s most trusted sources, few were aware of the rape charge, of which he had been cleared. Suddenly, Parker’s past troubles threaten to tarnish his passion project. Parker was born in Norfolk, Virginia, the same state where Turner was born into slavery, a fact Parker only discovered when he took African American studies at college. “Imagine my dismay,” he told the Hollywood Reporter before arriving at Sundance, “in learning that one of the greatest men to walk the soil in this country was a man who grew up and lived and breathed and fought less than 100 miles from where I grew up. ” His mother Carolyn  —   she was 17 years old when she gave birth to Parker  —   is a devout Christian, exerting a huge influence on Parker, now himself father to five young children. Speaking to Christianity Today Parker relayed what he viewed as the spiritual significance of The Birth of a Nation: “If you’re able to view this film without the baggage of racism, then it’s very clearly a story of someone that was compelled by his faith to act as the hand of the God through his interpretation. ” Carolyn never married Parker’s biological father, instead first wedding the man who would give Parker his surname she later married Walter Whitfield, an air force man, who uprooted his new family to Maine. When Parker was 11, his biological father, with whom he’d kept in touch, died of cancer with little warning. His death, coupled with all the changes, proved to be a lot for Parker, according to his mother, who has said that her son became “quite depressed”. He channelled his depression into anger, taking his demons out on classmates during his teenage years by beating them up at school. “It wasn’t just rage,” Parker recalled. “It was just being a kid that needed some kind of clarity. ” Aged 14, unable to bond with his new stepfather, Carolyn had her son return to Virginia to live with her brother Jay Combs, a former wrestler, who encouraged Parker to join his high school’s wrestling team. Parker was a natural at the sport and landed a full wrestling scholarship to Pennsylvania State University. It was at the beginning of his second year, in 1999, when he and Jean Celestin, a friend from the wrestling team, were charged with the rape and sexual assault of an    female student, who claimed to have been unconscious during the alleged attack. As the case went viral on campus, the pair were suspended from the team. Parker, who had had an earlier sexual encounter with the woman, which both said was consensual, was acquitted of the charges in 2001, while Celestin was found guilty of sexual assault, before being granted a new trial in 2005. That case never came to court after prosecutors balked at tracking down all the former witnesses. Court documents show that the woman said she was harassed by Parker and Celestin after she reported the incident to the police. She dropped out of college as a result. It’s since been revealed that the woman at the centre of the case, who had a child, killed herself in 2012. Parker responded to the development on his Facebook page, saying he was “devastated”. “As a    father of daughters and person of faith, I look back on that time as a teenager and can say without hesitation that I should have used more wisdom,” he wrote. After the trial, Parker transferred to the University of Oklahoma, where he earned a degree in management science and information systems, and quickly landed work designing websites. He had no aspirations to become an actor  —   instead he was roped into a newfound career after being approached by Jon Simmons, the agent who still represents him, at a talent search in Dallas, Texas, where his friend, an aspiring model, was hoping to get a gig. The story goes that Simmons had Parker   a scene from The Fast and the Furious and Parker was hooked. “The way it made me feel, it was like winning a match times a hundred,” he told the  . Naturally, he relocated to Los Angeles. Parker’s enviable bone structure and toned figure were noticed immediately, landing him small roles despite the fact he had no prior acting experience. In 2007, he put his athletic frame to use in the   drama Pride, which saw him act opposite Terrence Howard. His charisma impressed Denzel Washington, who cast him a year later in The Great Debaters, where Parker delivered a breakthrough performance as a student on an   debating team in 1935. From there, more   supporting performances followed: for Spike Lee, he ventured to Brooklyn in Red Hook Summer (2012) he conspired with Richard Gere in the financial thriller Arbitrage the same year. Despite his popularity, Parker soon arrived at a crossroads, uninspired creatively by the roles he was being offered. “So few of them had integrity,” he told the Hollywood Reporter. “As a black man, you leave auditions not hoping you get the job but wondering how you explain it to your family if you do. ” Once shooting on Beyond the Lights (2014) wrapped, Parker met his agents to tell them he would not be accepting any more projects until he could get his own film about American revolutionary Nat Turner off the ground. He stuck to his word, not working for two years on anything but what would come to be known as The Birth of a Nation, provocatively named after DW Griffith’s notoriously racist 1915 film. Parker had written and directed a couple of short films putting together a feature posed a foreign challenge. To get it all rolling, he invested $100, 000 of his own money before securing backers, including retired NBA player Michael Finley. The future of The Birth of Nation remains in doubt. Parker is expected to promote the film as planned, taking it to the Toronto international film festival in September, followed by a tour to churches and campusescorrect around the US, where he’ll discuss the issues of social justice raised by the film. But as awards season expert and Indiewire’s    Anne Thompson notes, the issue of rape “is going to keep coming up” despite Parker’s wishes to the contrary. (He told Deadline: “I will not relive that period of my life every time I go under the microscope. ”) There’s no avoiding it, argues Thompson, because Turner’s quest for retribution is largely set in motion because of a horrific rape. Thompson believes there’s “no precedent” for the situation Parker finds himself in. “The pattern with more established people in Hollywood is forgive and forget,” she says, citing Roman Polanski and Woody Allen, both of whom were also embroiled in rape controversies and yet managed to maintain their standing. “The larger Hollywood community doesn’t know Nate Parker. And they need to find out who he is. ” As for the general public, many might find the very idea of worrying about Hollywood’s assessment  —   or debates about the quality of the film  —   secondary concerns in the circumstances. • Comments will be opened later today, Born Nathaniel Emanuel Combs, 18 November, 1979 in Norfolk, Virginia. Best of times Taking his first   feature film, The Birth of a Nation, to the Sundance film festival, where it scored the biggest sale in the event’s history, as well as winning the grand jury prize. What he says “Far too often, as a black actor. .. you receive a hundred scripts in a year and two of them you feel represent the experience of the black male with strength and power and integrity.

FBI stands guilty of an overtly political act at a crucial moment
Democratic party outrage at the FBI’s shock revelation, almost on the eve of the US presidential election, that it is resuming its controversial investigation of Hillary Clinton after declaring in July that the matter was closed, has been fierce. Donna Brazile, chairwoman of the Democratic national committee, was one of many to cry foul. “The FBI has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters. Even the faintest appearance of using the agency’s power to influence our election is deeply troubling,” she said. John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chief, also hinted at skulduggery: “It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election. ” Podesta said the FBI statement left it unclear whether there was anything remotely new to investigate. This may well be true. In his letter of notification to Congress, James Comey, the FBI director, said he did not know whether a batch of newly discovered emails bore any relation to previous claims that Clinton acted illegally in sending private emails containing classified information when she was secretary of state from  . Comey said the new emails “appear to be pertinent” but he and his officials had not yet examined them. In a later statement, he admitted “we don’t know the significance” of the emails, but said he felt obliged to investigate and make his decision public. It is not even certain that the emails came from Clinton’s private server. Comey’s move is either extremely naive or extremely cynical. FBI investigations are routinely conducted behind closed doors. Only when a decision to prosecute has been taken, based on persuasive evidence, is an inquiry made public or suspects named. For a respected, ostensibly independent figure like the FBI director to tip his hand at this extraordinarily sensitive moment amounts to an overtly political, partisan act. Since it must be assumed that Comey is no fool, it must also be assumed that he knew what he was doing. A less damning explanation is that he was clumsily attempting to save the FBI (and himself) further criticism from the Republican right, which denounced his earlier investigatory efforts as a    . But if that is the case, why did Comey not have a confidential word with the relevant congressional oversight committees? Nobody could then subsequently accuse him of a  . And he would not have triggered the firestorm in which the FBI’s impartiality is again being questioned, and this time from the left. Whatever Comey’s reasons, the damage is done. Clinton must now try to weather the storm until 8 November, having previously believed that she was in the clear. It will be a rough ride. The ugliest and most personally vindictive presidential campaign in modern history is now set for a frenetic, furious and   finale. Donald Trump and his supporters have been quick to wade in. Speaking on the campaign trail, the Republican nominee revived jibes that Clinton is a corrupt and habitual liar. In typically hyperbolic terms, he said that her conduct was “the biggest scandal since Watergate”. As usual, Trump’s risible exaggeration undermines his case. But the genuine anger and alarm expressed by Clinton’s surrogates reflect their fear his attacks may be hitting home and their knowledge of how damaging renewed questions about her honesty and competence could potentially be. Although in Trump she faces the least qualified and, for a host of reasons, most objectionable Republican candidate in living memory, Clinton is still only about 5% ahead in the polls, as a national average. This bald figure may be considered misleading. In 14 battleground or “swing” states, where the electoral college will be decided, Clinton is ahead in all but Ohio, Iowa and Georgia. But polls across the nation are tightening. This latest flurry of negative headlines in national media desperate for a sensational story to keep the race alive (or in some cases, to dish her) will not help. Despite her advantages in experience, name recognition, political achievement and spending power, Clinton has evidently failed to knock Trump out of the race. Despite a deeply damaging few weeks for Trump, when he was beset by allegations of sexual misconduct, he still appears, amazingly, to be in with a shot. A more skilled and savvy politician than Clinton could and would have buried Trump months ago. A more charismatic, popular or likeable Democratic   could now be awaiting electoral coronation. This latest blow may cause some underwhelmed Democrats to abstain. And Clinton’s best pitch to sceptical independent and undecided voters  —   that she is the least worst candidate  —   leaves her vulnerable to a   upset.

Fire at Sea review – masterly and moving look at the migrant crisis
Gianfranco Rosi’s beautiful, mysterious and moving film is a documentary that looks like a neorealist classic. It is a portrait of Lampedusa, the Sicilian island where desperate migrants from Africa and the Middle East arrive each year hoping for a new life in Europe: 400, 000 in the last 20 years. Around its coast thousands are drowned, or dragged dead from their grotesquely unsafe inflatables, burned or poisoned by fumes from the diesel with which their craft have had to be refuelled from jerry cans   in choppy seas. Lampedusa has quietly become the tragic epicentre of the migrant experience: part holding tank, part cemetery. The title refers to a wartime Sicilian song that a local DJ is shown playing, about the bombing of an Italian warship in 1943 in port at Lampedusa, prior to the island’s surrender to the allies, and how the flames lit up the night: Che fuoco a mare che c’è stasera (“What fire at sea there is tonight”). It also put me in mind of the line from the maritime hymn: “For those in peril on the sea. ” Islanders in Lampedusa make a living from fishing. Generations have grown up and grown old with the fear of dying at sea. The endless tide of migrants has made that fear a daily and horrible reality. Using mainly fixed camera positions and no narrative voiceover, Gianfranco Rosi enigmatically juxtaposes scenes, switching between the migrants’ daily, desperate landfall, and the everyday existence of one Lampedusa family: and one young boy in particular, Samuele, whose uncle is a fisherman. Samuele does his best at school, he slurps his pasta at dinner, and he likes cutting branches that will make handles for his naughty slingshots. He has a lazy eye that doctors are treating with the   method of blanking out one lens for the good eye, forcing the lazy one to work harder. Samuele is also suffering from hyperventilation and anxiety, and is seen by the same depressed doctor who has to attend to the migrants and carry out autopsies on their wretched corpses. He is the one explicit point of contact between the migrants’ story and Samuele, one hint of a symptom, or a larger malaise. Rosi’s previous film was the fascinating Sacro GRA, a   study of the Grande Raccordo Anulare, or ring road around Rome, and the people who live on this margin. There is a similar effect in Fire at Sea. Rosi has recorded quiet details from indigenous Lampedusan lives at the periphery of something far more historically dramatic and sensational, but the quietly telling details are like jetsam, flung out centrifugally. The film does not take a view it does not demand action. It simply shows us the details, and I felt I learned more from this film than from the nightly TV news. The migrants themselves pass through the film almost too quickly for individual lives to be registered, except one Nigerian who tells his story almost like a preacher or an actor: “The sea is not a place to pass by   …     The sea is not a road. ” This is daily life, the film is saying: maybe like life during wartime. It is not a temporary eruption or crisis that will be imminently solved within the conventional news cycle. Here is the rhythm of daily existence it is Lampedusa’s new normal. There is an enigmatic pageant of scenes: setting the table for supper, listening to the radio, opening the hangar door for the   rescue helicopter (a mesmerically slow and sinuous sequence) migrants having a football match in near darkness and arguing about which nationalities can play, migrants’ dead bodies taken ashore by coastguards in white hazmat suits. The islanders are not shown objecting to the migrants, or welcoming them, or discussing what to do about them. I concede that this is arguably a flaw, an artefactual silence that drains the situation of its political reality. But it shows that this is a situation that Lampedusa has become used to over decades. Samuele himself is a compelling figure. There is one very simple edit Rosi contrives, showing him taking aim with his catapult and then just cutting to his face in closeup, frowning with concentration: pugnacious, yet innocent and vulnerable. In its quiet way, it is sensational. I’m tempted to say Samuele is a descendant of Enzo Staiola as young Bruno in De Sica’s Bicycle Thieves. What does Samuele’s face mean? Has he somehow absorbed the spores of world history? Is his artless manner a way of suggesting that life will go on, with or without compassion or solutions? Fire at Sea is masterly  .

Samantha Bee meets Glenn Beck: ’It’s all of us against Trumpism’
Samantha Bee and Glenn Beck sat down to discuss the Trump tenure, with the former rightwing Fox host admitting he had made mistakes and that he didn’t want to do any more damage. On the latest episode of Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, the comedian and Beck talked through the changes they thought were needed in order to help Americans get through the next four years.  Top of the list was a thawing of the relationship between those on the left and right of the political discussion, who might actually both agree “Trumpism” could do serious damage to the country. When Beck asked why Bee had invited him on the show, she said: “Because I think that our future is going to require a broad coalition of nonpartisan decency. It’s not just individual people against Donald Trump, it’s all of us against Trumpism. And so I actually think it’s important to reach into places where we wouldn’t normally reach. ” Beck added that he was a fan of Bee’s and that he believed in her message and approach to tackling American politics. “I believe you actually don’t want to do damage,” he said. “As a guy who has done damage, I don’t want to do any more damage. I know what I did. I helped divide. My message to you is please don’t make the mistakes that I made. ” He went on to say that Facebook and Twitter had become places where people sought to find division and “tear each other apart”. Another segment highlighted the action being take in North Carolina by Republican politicians who are seeking to erode the powers of the newly elected Democratic governor, Roy Cooper.  Bee also focused on the Syrian crisis. With politicians such as Trump suggesting helping refugees would mean neglecting US veterans, Bee’s correspondent Allana Harkin interviewed veterans who disagreed.

SEC document shows Trump was worth less than half of $10bn claim in 2012
On the 2016 campaign trail, Donald Trump has insisted that he is worth more than $10bn. However, a statement filed to the Securities and Exchange Commission by Wells Fargo Securities on Trump’s behalf in 2012 indicated that the real estate developer was then worth less than half that, with comparatively few of the liquid assets that may now finance his campaign for president. In the document, which concerned the securitization of commercial mortgages on properties including Trump Tower in New York City, Trump was described as being worth more than $4. 2bn, with liquid assets of more than $250m.  A passage in the   filing says: “The sponsor is Donald J Trump. Mr Trump has significant commercial real estate holdings worldwide including interests in office, retail, residential,   and hospitality properties in markets including New York, San Francisco, Florida, Washington DC, and Scotland. As of 30 June 2011, Mr Trump reports a net worth in excess of $4. 2bn and liquidity in excess of $250m. ” The Trump campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  Jessica Ong, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, insisted the 2012 filing was correct.  She said: “Obviously, if it was inaccurate, we wouldn’t have filed it with the SEC. ” While $250m is a large amount of money, it is nowhere near enough to finance a modern presidential campaign. Trump has already loaned between $43m and $50m to his campaign, raising questions about how much he can afford to continue to spend without selling off assets or taking on significant loans.  Trump has insisted that he has far more than $250m in liquid assets, last year telling Fox News anchor Sean Hannity he had $400m, all of which he was prepared to use. In sworn testimony for a 2007 lawsuit, deposition transcripts show, Trump was asked by a lawyer whether he had “ever exaggerated in statements about your properties?” “I think everyone does,” Trump answered. The lawyer pressed: “Does that mean that sometimes you’ll inflate the value of your properties in your statements?” “Not beyond reason,” Trump said. Trump’s claim to be able to   his campaign has been a foundation of his   successful claim to be independent of the Washington establishment. Although he is now frantically building a fundraising apparatus, he has insisted this is simply to help the Republican National Committee (RNC) raise money for the party as a whole. His campaign reported only $1. 3m “cash on hand” to begin the month of June, in contrast to Hillary Clinton’s $42. 5m. The RNC has not seemed overly concerned. Speaking to CNN in June, the group’s chief strategist, Sean Spicer, said that if Trump “wanted to get that [fundraising] number up in two seconds, he just strokes a check and it’s up”. The Trump campaign has insisted that the businessman has converted his loan into a donation. No such paperwork has yet been filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).  The 2012 SEC filing contradicts a claim made by Trump in November 2011, in which he said he had a net worth of more than $7bn and insisted that he derived almost $3bn from the value of his personal brand. In May 2016, Trump filed a statement with the FEC in which he insisted his “net worth is in excess of $10bn”. The disclosure indicated that he had taken on at least $50m in debt and sold off assets in the past year. While the statement from Wells Fargo indicates that Trump may be far less wealthy than he claims, it would also indicate that he is in better financial shape than many financial experts believe, unless he has suffered significant undisclosed financial losses in recent years.  Fortune magazine has estimated that Trump is currently worth $3. 9bn in 2015, Bloomberg News assessed Trump’s fortune at $2. 9bn.  Another billionaire, Mark Cuban, has scoffed at Trump’s claims, suggesting the presumptive Republican nominee may not be a billionaire at all. Cuban’s reading of Trump’s most recent financial disclosure was that Trump may only have $165m available.

Capybara captured: rodent’s brief taste of freedom comes to an end
Toronto’s second     is back behind bars, after an   five weeks on the run from a Toronto park, munching grass and lolling around in ponds. The capybara’s brief taste of freedom came to an end on Tuesday, after the rodent  —   native to South America and resembling a large, tailless beaver with stumpy legs  —   was lured into a cage near a pond in the   park in the city.  “It’s baaaack!” Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation announced on Facebook. The capybara, it said, was now resting indoors as it awaited medical assessment. “Once it gets a clean bill of health, and is comfortable in its surroundings, it will be reunited with the other capybara. ” The announcement brought an end to Toronto’s saga of the missing capybaras  —   a tale that captured the city’s imagination and made headlines around the world. On 24 May, two capybaras, one male and one female, bolted from a small zoo in Toronto’s High Park. It was their first day at the High Park zoo, after being brought in from a breeder in Texas to join Chewie, the zoo’s lone capybara.  The door on their cage reportedly wasn’t properly closed and the pair, dubbed Bonnie and Clyde by zoo staff, fled. One of the capybaras was captured earlier this month, but the other remained at large for another two weeks, outmaneuvering search teams in hot pursuit.  As hundreds of Toronto residents reported sightings, officials warned residents not to approach the animals. The world’s largest rodent, capybaras can grow to weigh as much as 150lb. Just six months old, Toronto’s rogue capybaras are around 30lb in size.  The outlaws were celebrated as folk heroes on social media, with capybara Twitter accounts taunting the dozens of park employees and capybara hunters out searching for the fugitives: “We can hear helicopters overhead. Is that you looking for us, @HighParkZoo?” Volunteers and professionals joined the search, learning all they could about the sleeping and eating habits of the rodents in order to predict their next moves.  After initial attempts to attract the rodents by playing capybara calls over a speaker yielded no results, search teams turned to traps baited with corn and fruit to lure the animals. Ultimately this was how both of the wayward rodents were captured.  Officials said the second capybara could be back in its place at the zoo  —   and on display to the public  —   as early as Thursday.

Wreckage of Captain James Cook’s ship Endeavour found, researchers say
Researchers said they believe they have located the wreckage of the Endeavour, a ship sailed by the famous British explorer James Cook, which was sunk off the US during the revolutionary war. The ship was scuttled in 1778 leading up to the Battle of Rhode Island between American colonists and the British, and was as part of a blockade during the revolutionary war. It now appears to have been located by the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project (RIMAP) at one of nine sites containing 13 ships. The ship, which Cook sailed in the Pacific Ocean, passed through a number of hands before eventually being renamed the Lord Sandwich and used in the revolutionary war blockade. RIMAP said it had pinpointed the wreckage at a site that included five other vessel, off the state of Rhode Island in Newport harbor. The association is launching a campaign to finance the construction of a storage facility to accommodate the objects that are likely to be found during excavation. During his famous   voyage, Cook helped map the   Pacific Ocean and took possession of Australia in the name of the Crown.

Fukushima: tsunami waves hit after 7.4 magnitude earthquake hits Japan
Japan has lifted all tsunami warnings issued after a 7.  earthquake hit off the country’s east coast, as the risk of major damage appeared to pass. The quake, which struck east of Fukushima prefecture at about 6am on Tuesday, prompted urgent warnings for people to leave   areas in Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures as a series of tsunami waves hit the shore. The warnings allowed for the possibility of waves of up to 3m (10 feet) along the country’s   Pacific coast, but the highest recorded wave, of 1. 4m (4. 6 feet) was observed at Sendai port shortly after 8am. The tsunami warnings in Fukushima and Miyagi were downgraded to the less severe status of advisories nearly four hours after the initial quake, although people were still urged to stay away from coastal areas. Similar tsunami advisories also remained in place in Iwate and Ibaraki prefectures, until all advisories were finally lifted nearly seven hours after the earthquake. There were no reports of severe injuries from the quake, which struck at a depth of 30 km (18. 6 miles) according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. In a statement, the agency said the earthquake was thought to be an aftershock of the 9.  event that devastated the same region in 2011. The region was also hit by a series of weaker quakes throughout Tuesday. The Tokyo Electric Power Company said it had restored a cooling system at the Fukushima Daini nuclear power plant that briefly stopped after the quake, national broadcaster NHK reported. The car maker Nissan suspended work at its Fukushima factory, which was badly damaged by the 2011 disaster known as the Great East Japan Earthquake. A spokesman for the company told the Guardian all employees had been evacuated from the plant, which is in the city of Iwaki, and the factory was unlikely to return to operation on Tuesday. Meanwhile, firefighting officials in Iwaki in Fukushima said a fire broke out at a petrochemical complex and was later extinguished, NHK said. Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who is overseas for meetings, said the government would work with local governments to help any affected areas. “From my side, to the nation, we asked that proper and accurate information over the tsunami and the evacuation should be issued, and also to grasp and understand the condition of the damage as quickly as possible, and also to take proper emergency measures,” he said. Twelve people have suffered injuries, NHK reported, including an elderly woman in Fukushima prefecture who was said to have been hurt when a cupboard toppled over. The quake also shook other parts of Japan, including Tokyo. Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world’s most seismically active areas. Japan accounts for about 20% of the world’s earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater. The devastating 11 March 2011 quake was magnitude 9, the strongest quake in Japan on record. The massive tsunami it triggered caused world’s worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl. All nuclear plants on the coast threatened by the tsunami remain closed in the wake of the Fukushima disaster.  Only two reactors are operating in Japan, both in the   of the country.  Even when in shutdown nuclear plants need cooling systems operating to keep spent fuel cool.

Ageist and body-shaming Trump statue falls short as art and satire
What has been seen, the saying goes, cannot be unseen, and for Indecline, a   “anarchist art collective” that was surely the point: on Thursday, the group installed five   effigies of Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, in five cities across the US that left nothing to the imagination. If you have none yourself, the title helped you out. The Emperor Has No Balls, the group gleefully dubbed it,   duplicates of the naked Trump in New York, San Francisco, Cleveland, Seattle and Los Angeles. Each lasted barely an hour before being removed, but in an era where viral   precludes the fact of actually being there, that was more than long enough. The thousands of naked Trump selfies pinging around the social mediasphere made avoiding the gruesome spectacle impossible. Naked Trump is a part of us now, a perpetual presence forever an   Google image search away.  So now, inevitably, we’re left with the fallout  —   to parse meaning from the gesture, to clear smoke from the explosion and look for the fire. There’s an easy defence here, of course, if you care to seat No Balls (I’ll use the abbreviated version, if I may) in the   tradition of ghastly political satire.  Depending on how far back you want to go, using images where words would be seen as too crass or literal (or actionable) is a   tradition that stretches back to the Renaissance. Da Vinci’s array of grotesque little heads, the hellish fantasy landscapes of Dutch masters Hieronymus Bosch or Pieter Bruegel the Elder, which they peopled with every manner of grotesquely distorted, hybrid creature, are   of conscious social critique through art, while Michelangelo’s frescoes in the Sistine Chapel are embedded with cheeky   aimed at the ruling papal class. In Spain, Diego Velazquez, revered as he was as the official court painter of King Philip IV, was a sly subversive, mocking his masters as they imagined him capturing their glory. No Balls, of course, engages in no such subtleties, so let’s push aside the notion of it as art straight off. It’s more in the company of the evolving gutter press of   England, unique in Europe for having no censorship laws, where the penny press made its fortune on the ribald caricatures of the powerful. (One famous image, from 1740, of an outsize Prime Minister Robert Walpole bent over, trousers down, his giant buttocks gleaming, seems an historical confrere to Indecline’s action this week.)  Indeed, No Balls has little affinity with great political art, past or present. One of the most powerful critiques of American policy I’ve seen in recent years came from the American duo Jennifer Allora and Guillermo Calzadilla, who represented the US at the 2011 Venice Biennale. The duo  —   known, though not well  —   looked to represent the ardor of their times: using gymnastic routines performed atop an actual   tank, it conflated militarism and athletics, perhaps America’s   exports, within the bounds of sharp political satire (that its nonstop clanking echoed throughout the grounds of the gentle Giardini captured another American hallmark: loudness). So where, in the great pantheon of such things, does No Balls sit? Not very high, and for a variety of reasons. Even to take the measure of great caricature, which relies on grotesque hyperbole to prove a point, it falls, if you’ll pardon the pun, a little short. While it receives full marks for its nominal conceit  —   hubris, which Trump quite clearly has in no slight supply, has prompted many a leader to lionize themselves in sculptural form  —   the stunted member of Trump’s anatomy to which the sculpture means to draw our attention is its undoing.  Emasculation, one can fairly say, is the least notable of Trump’s many shortcomings. No balls? For what presidential candidate in recent memory could that be further from the truth? This is the man who pondered openly how shooting someone on Fifth Avenue might help him poll better. Whatever Trump’s anatomical shortfalls, this is clearly not one of them, and the piece weakens itself with a contradiction to pitch a sophomoric joke. (For what it’s worth, a recent mural of Trump’s nemesis, Hillary Clinton, appeared on a wall in Australia in much the same fashion the candidate was portrayed as busty,   and dripping $100 bills. The cash we can understand, but the body? Like Trump, the tasteless   is undone not by its lack of taste, but its lack of point.) Speaking of anatomy  —   mercifully, in a general sense this time  —   there’s an argument to be made that, for Trump, given his own lack of boundaries, none should apply. But No Balls crosses, perhaps unintentionally, into territory that serves to undermine whatever message it may mean to carry. The piece, with its slumpy, distended belly, withered buttocks and sagging pectorals, crosses callously into generalized ageism and   unlike the attempted caricaturization of Trump’s particular bits, this is no joke, but rather an expression of unmitigated contempt, and whatever else it does, it dissolves satirical intent in an instant.  There are some that may say, in an age of Kardashians, Jenners and Cyruses, that no such rules apply, but I don’t think so. Whomever one is talking about, shaming his or her physical self is worse than cruelty for its own sake (though it is that): it’s irrelevant.  The group has made clever interventions in the past  —   replacing the names of stars on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame with the names of black men killed by police was a tightly bundled critique of the media and society’s rabidly misplaced attentions  —   but here, intended satire gives way to blind hatred that obscures their intent. And there’s nothing funny about that.

Donald Trump forgives more than $50m in personal loans to campaign
Donald Trump’s presidential campaign announced on Thursday that the presumptive Republican nominee had “fully extinguished” his loans to his presidential campaign. The Trump campaign announced the loans totaled more than $50m, although the Federal Election Commission (FEC) only lists $45, 703, 185 loaned by the candidate to the campaign. Although no documentation had been filed with the FEC online on Thursday afternoon, a Trump spokesperson told the Guardian: “My understanding is it is in process and will be completed today. ” In forgiving the loans, Trump sent a major signal to Republican donors who were worried that he would use campaign contributions to reimburse himself. So far, Trump has only raised $17m in individual contributions, many of which have come from small donors buying hats from his campaign.  In order to run a competitive campaign against Hillary Clinton in November, most observers agree Trump needs to ramp up fundraising significantly. He has held few fundraisers and only sent out his first fundraising email on Tuesday. In a fundraising email on Wednesday sent by Donald Trump Jr, the scion claimed that the campaign had raised $2m from that initial fundraising email. Trump has long boasted that he was   his campaign as a way to establish his bona fides as a candidate independent of Washington special interests. However, despite his claims that he is worth $10bn, outside experts have long looked skeptically at those assertions and many have raised questions about how much of his assets are actually liquid and easily available to be spent on the campaign. In his most recent campaign finance report, Trump had spent $1. 1m, nearly 20% of his overall spending in May, on businesses that he owned. This included more than $423, 000 on facility rental and catering at his Florida resort,    and another $350, 000 on travel air on Tag Air, the holding company that owns Trump’s jet.

Longtime matchmaker Joe Silva reportedly retiring after sale of UFC
In a development that might significantly affect the Ultimate Fighting Championship going forward, the organization’s top matchmaker Joe Silva is reportedly retiring. MMAjunkie first reported the news on Wendesday night saying that Silva might leave the world’s leading mixed martial arts promotion by the end of the year. Silva maintains a    presence at the organization and is rarely interviewed, but his ability to assess fighters and pair them in intriguing matchups has been a big part of the UFC’s success. His role predates the tenures of president Dana White and outgoing owners Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta, who took over the UFC and made it a   dollar industry. A big part of the reason the UFC has been able to rise is the ability of their management to find compelling fights and package them in glossy    productions. Since the UFC controls the fate of their fighters, they mostly dictate the bouts. The fighters generally accept the proposed fights or risk being dropped. The MMAjunkie story says Silva is leaving after earning a share of the UFC’s sale to   this summer. His timing might be fortuitous depending on how much interest Congress shows in trying to apply the Ali Act to mixed martial arts. Oklahoma congressman Markwayne Mullin is pushing to extend the 2000 boxing law to the UFC.  Among the Ali Act’s provisions are stipulations that promoters must open their books to fighters, can’t enter into   contracts with fighters and have to use independent rankings in putting together championship bouts. Application of the law could extend more power to the fighters, but it might also hamper the UFC’s ability to put together the most attractive bouts.

Ian Traynor obituary
Ian Traynor, who has died aged 60 of cancer, was the Guardian’s Europe editor and one of the great journalists of the period following the end of the cold war. An outstanding linguist, Ian was a man of the European continent and a passionate believer in the cause of its union, on the basis of both his professional experience and personal essence. In a recent conversation, he and I wondered how we would have reacted to being told in 1991, in the ruins of Vukovar, the town in eastern Croatia devastated by Serbian forces  —   which Ian covered unforgettably  —   that within 25 years this place would be in the European Union, but Britain would be on its way out. In 2003, Ian was appointed Europe editor, based in Zagreb and later in Brussels, where, said his colleague Simon Tisdall: “His performance was truly outstanding. No other correspondent could surpass his understanding and contacts. ” My first proper meeting with Ian came soon after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, when the edifice of communism continued to collapse in Nicolae Ceauşescu’s Romania. It being Christmas, people tended not to want to go, apart from Ian, myself and our Hungarian deputy foreign editor, Nick Dallman. The time came for me to relieve Ian in Bucharest, so he might cover other parts of the country. Journalists were holed up in the plush Intercontinental hotel in the capital  —   apart from, typically, the Guardian, which Ian had headquartered in the cheaper, peeling Continental hotel, also home to a Securitate secret service sniper’s nest. I arrived off a night train into the weirdness of slushy Bucharest to find Ian sitting alone in the hotel bar smoking a cigarette. “Hi there,” he said in his laconic Scottish timbre, “welcome to Romania  —   it’s fucked, and there’s shooting from the hotel, which is returned the Washington Post guy left when a bullet hit his bedhead. Also, we have to file from a Bulgarian telex machine with several keys missing. The coffee’s good, would you like one?” Ian imparted this information deadpan the whole place was like a    newsreel movie from another time anyway, and had he not devoted his life to journalism, he would have made a magnificent actor. But that was never going to happen. Ian was born in Penilee,   Glasgow, the son of Tommy, a toolmaker, and his wife Phemie (Euphemia). When he was 12, the family moved to East Kilbride, south of the city, and Ian went to Holy Cross high school, Hamilton. As a boy, he read George Orwell and mapped out his life in accordance with an acquaintanceship with the writing of James Cameron: he knew exactly what he wanted to be  —   the foreign correspondent he became. By the age of 16, Ian was proficient enough in Russian and German to win a place at Glasgow University, from which he dropped out, later taking a place at Aberdeen, where he graduated in modern languages. His best friend there was the eventual BBC correspondent Angus Roxburgh, who remembers discovering, on a Russian faculty camp, that Ian played the guitar: “I was playing Joni Mitchell’s California, a very difficult bit, and Ian just joined in. He was better than me, and we’ve always kept playing together. He had a wonderful style, and loved Dick Gaughan, John Martyn and Bert Jansch. ” Ian joined the BBC monitoring unit at Caversham Park, near Reading, translating and analysing media information from the USSR  —   different work before the internet, which involved finding sources as well as understanding them. He was among the first to foresee the end of the cold war and, in 1987, Ian’s rare talent was spotted by the Guardian’s foreign editor, Martin Woollacott, who recruited him to the paper’s foreign subeditors’ desk. Woollacott soon dispatched his protege to cover the stories himself: the Solidarity strikes in Poland during 1988, then the fall of the Berlin Wall. Thereafter, as East Europe correspondent and editor, Ian sailed and navigated the currents and   of events across the continent. When the euphoria of reunified Europe crashed into the nightmare of   Ian was one of what became the “Guardian triangle” of reporters (usually two of us on the ground) with Maggie O’Kane and myself  —   later supplemented by Julian Borger. By the war’s end in 1995, Ian had based himself in Vienna, but now moved first to Bonn and then Berlin when it became Germany’s capital once again, with the title of Central Europe correspondent. From there, Ian guided his readers through the way in which the organism of a newly expanded EU evolved around the German powerhouse. In 1999, Ian moved to Moscow. He charted the rise of Vladimir Putin and, as so often, was first to ring the warning bells. However, writing in 2000 about Putin’s redrawing of the map of Russia, Ian could not resist observing, in apparently deadly earnest, that: “Mr Putin’s writ does not run in Bashkortostan. ” Ian wrote straight, however contorted the story, and lucidly. “He was the opposite of a sensationalist,” said Roxburgh. He could read a situation with uncanny sagacity his editor for many years, Paul Webster, recalled him as “a rare combination of intellectual and     hack. He was a very brave man but there was no trace of bravado  —   he felt it was his duty to provide testimony. ” Roxburgh remembered: “This figure arriving at our compound in Afghanistan, having walked across the Panjshir Valley for three days without food or water, on the verge of collapse  —   I made him a cup of sweet tea. He was tenacious, to put it mildly. ” Ian’s devotion to “the story” made him the most collegial reporter of all, as eager to help other people  —   including me on many occasions, even the opposition  —   write good narrative as to write it himself, a rare quality. Tisdall recalled him as “a slightly   figure, not given to   or   in a media world where willingness to blow one’s own trumpet became, increasingly, the principal measure of individual worth. Perhaps this is one reason why his work was not sufficiently recognised in terms of prizes and gongs. Another was his   intolerance of bullshit. ” The   press corps when we were in Bosnia had at its kernel an antagonism between Ian and a particular expert who would argue that intervention against the Bosnian Serbs would set the region ablaze. Ian disagreed, and when Nato began its tardy, limited air strikes in 1995, the Serb leader, Radovan Karadžić, capitulated immediately. Ian, vindicated, leaned across a table and told his colleague: “If you’re gonna be a prophet, you got to get it right. ” On another occasion, his drollness surfaced when Ian and I were driving through yet another incinerated town, levelled into the dust of its own charred masonry, in horrified silence  —   until Ian leaned back in his seat, staring out, and said quietly: “What is it the Serbs have got against roofs?” Ian’s son, Paul, described his father as “a man of many words unless he wanted to be a man of few. If he didn’t need to say more than he had to, he wouldn’t. Personal back and forths after months of incommunicado would usually consist of ‘Arite, what’s up?’ ‘Nae bad’. Not that he didn’t want to talk, that was just his style. And he was fundamentally unaware of the sheer admiration that family, friends and most colleagues felt for him. ” Towards the end of Ian’s career came three severe blows to the European dream. First, there was the crisis that pitched radical Greece against a   which Ian saw as a “disaster for Athens and colossal failure for the EU”. Then, as his health began to fail, the arrival of what felt like the future of the planet on Europe’s doorstep in the form of refugees from Syria’s carnage and Africa’s climate crisis. Ian was furious at nation states disguising their own failures as that of the EU. Finally there was Brexit, though Ian was by then too ill for us to feel  —   or read  —   his disdain and disgust. Ian had met his first wife, Jean Forsyth, while they were both students at Aberdeen. They married in 1982, and had two sons, Paul and Martin. Jean was with Ian during his final days. Their union ended in divorce and in 2003 Ian married Ivanka Anicić, whom he met in Croatia. They had a son, Sean. Ivanka died in 2011, and Ian is survived by his three sons. • Ian Traynor, journalist, born 11 November 1955 died 27 August 2016

’The end of Trump’: how Facebook deepens millennials’ confirmation bias
HBO host John Oliver achieved the destruction of Donald Trump on 29 February 2016. At least, according to the Daily Beast. Fansided, a popular social news aggregator, dates Trump’s destruction at 1 August while the Daily Good called it for 21 March. Salon found no fewer than “13 glorious times” that Oliver had destroyed the real estate tycoon.   consumers of the news might note that it is impossible to, as the dictionary says, “put an end to the existence of something” more than a single time. But for #NeverTrump Facebook users who love any content they see as bringing Trump down a peg, the formulaic headline is indicative of the Facebook media landscape: the most shareable, clickable and likable content on the site aligns strongly with its readership’s   biases, assumptions and political affiliation. For millennials who have never known an election without Facebook, the political landscape of the social media network has massive implications for the upcoming contest between Hillary Clinton and Trump  —   not least of which because of Facebook’s outsized influence on their exposure to political news. Six out of every 10 millennials (61%) get their political news on Facebook, according to a survey conducted by Pew Research Center, making the 1. 7   social behemoth (which includes more than 200 million in the United States) the largest millennial marketplace for news and ideas in the world. But within Facebook’s ecosystem exists a warren of walled gardens, intellectual biomes created by users whose interest in interacting with opposing political views  —   and those who are them  —   is nearly nonexistent. “Baby boomers are the most likely to see political content on Facebook that supports their own views,” said Amy Mitchell, the director of journalism research at Pew Research Center. “  percent of baby boomers on Facebook who pay attention to political posts say the posts they see are mostly or always in line with their own views, higher than both Gen Xers and millennials. ” But baby boomers are the least likely to get their political news from Facebook  —   unlike millennials. According to another Pew Research Center survey from 2014, “consistent conservatives” were twice as likely as the average Facebook user to say that posts about politics on Facebook were “mostly or always” in line with their own views, and that four in 10 “consistent liberals” say they have blocked or unfriended someone over political disagreements. This creates what the New York Times’ Ross Douthat calls the “Samantha Bee Problem” named after the   comedian whose unbridled criticism of fellow   comedians for not holding Trump accountable for past statements sparked a “Samantha Bee Destroys   …    ”    of its own. The widespread sharing of Bee’s segment, Douthat hypothesizes, is indicative of political chambers that inured Facebook audiences to conversations solely with those who share their opinions. “Among millennials, especially,” Douthat argues, “there’s a growing constituency for whom rightwing ideas are so alien or triggering, leftwing orthodoxy so pervasive and unquestioned, that supporting a candidate like Hillary Clinton looks like a needless form of compromise. ” That confirmation bias  —   the psychological tendency for people to embrace new information as affirming their   beliefs and to ignore evidence that doesn’t  —   is seeing itself play out in new ways in the social ecosystem of Facebook. Unlike Twitter  —   or real life  —   where interaction with those who disagree with you on political matters is an inevitability, Facebook users can block, mute and unfriend any outlet or person that will not further bolster their current worldview. Even Facebook itself sees the segmentation of users along political lines on its site   and synchronizes it not only with the posts users see, but with the advertisements they’re shown. Test it out yourself: Go to facebook.   on your browser and click the “Lifestyle and Culture” tab under the “Interests” banner. You see the box titled “US Politics”? It’s followed with a parenthetical notation of your political alignment, from “Very Conservative” to “Very Liberal”. Platforms  —   and   websites  —   have followed the behavioral lead of Facebook’s users. “News sources”  —   largely aggregators of video clips and interviews from other sites  —   that barely exist beyond the sharing economy of Facebook have arisen as major players in the site’s political news sphere. Sites such as US Uncut, Occupy Democrats, Addicting Info, Make America Great and The Other 98% may barely have homepages, but their Facebook pages are rich with millions of followers and   engagement  —   in many cases higher than many mainstream news outlets combined. Occupy Democrats, a   page popular with supporters of onetime Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, has 3. 8 million likes on its Facebook page. MSNBC, another   outlet with far wider reach outside of Facebook, has a mere 1. 6 million. Not everyone sees the proliferation of openly ideological outlets that meet the needs of openly ideological friend circles as evidence that millennials are more extreme in their confirmation bias than prior generations. “I don’t see sufficient evidence to buy the argument about siloing and confirmation bias,” Jeff Jarvis, a professor at the City University of New York’s graduate school of journalism said. “That is a presumption about the platforms  —   because we in media think we do this better. More important, such presumptions fundamentally insult young people. For too long, old media has assumed that young people don’t care about the world. ” Facebook is, after all, a reflection of its users’ wants and behavior  —   it’s not Mark Zuckerberg’s fault people seek out   news sources to buttress their political beliefs. Before Facebook’s walled gardens came the cable news wars between   MSNBC and   Fox News, and before that, local newspapers that catered to the certain wings of a city’s population. (Think the Washington Post versus the Washington Times.) “Newspapers, remember, came from the perspective of very few people: one editor, really,” Jarvis said. “Facebook comes with many perspectives and gives many as Zuckerberg points out, no two people on Earth see the same Facebook. ” The onus, then may be on millennials  —   and all Facebook users  —   to proactively seek out news sources outside of their ideological comfort zone. “Yes, Facebook shows us what our friends like,” Jarvis said. “But if you have smart friends, chances are they will send you to smart things. Further, arguments online show the existence of opposing views, so I don’t buy that young people are unaware of other sides. ” “Journalism’s job is to inform society. If society is   it is our failure. ”

Daily Mail lawsuit is a message from Trump: stay away from my family
The lawsuit filed by the wife of Donald Trump against the Daily Mail is a message to the media from her husband “to stay away from my family, particularly Melania” his biographer has said. Lawyers for Melania Trump on Thursday filed suit for $150m in damages against the newspaper in Maryland state court. The wife of the Republican presidential nominee is also suing a blogger, Webster Tarpley, from the state in question. In a statement, Trump’s lawyer, Charles Harder, said: “These defendants made several statements about Mrs Trump that are 100% false and tremendously damaging to her personal and professional reputation [and] broadcast their lies to millions of people throughout the US and the world  —   without any justification. “Their many lies include, among others, that Mrs Trump supposedly was an ‘escort’ in the 1990s before she met her husband. Defendants’ actions are so egregious, malicious and harmful to Mrs Trump that her damages are estimated at $150m. ” The suit was filed in Montgomery County, a suburban area bordering Washington DC, in response to articles published in August by the Daily Mail that reported rumors that Melania Trump worked as an escort in the 1990s. Last month, announcing that she was considering a suit, her lawyer called those rumors “100% false”. In an interview with the Guardian, biographer Wayne Barrett, who has been threatened with lawsuits by Trump in the past over his reporting, said that the lawsuit seemed to be “more a threat to other reporters, publishers, news organizations” to shy away from reporting about the Republican nominee’s wife.  The author of Trump: The Greatest Show on Earth and Trump: The Deals and the Downfall noted that the candidate had a reputation for litigiousness with reporters and said Trump had bragged to him nearly 40 years ago about “breaking reporters”. Barrett noted that, at the time, “there hadn’t been anything written negative about Donald”. Trump went on to sue author Tim O’Brien for reporting that the Republican nominee had exaggerated his wealth in what Barrett described as an “attempt to wreck O’Brien”. (The suit was dismissed.) Barrett added that Trump’s approach with the press had always been, “from the very beginning, to threaten, browbeat, seduce them”. The Daily Mail article also contained allegations that Melania Trump came to New York a year earlier than she has claimed, raising issues about her immigration status. Trump denied a story in Politico in which questions about her immigration status were first reported. The lawsuit noted that while the article in question had been removed from the Daily Mail’s website, the newspaper had yet to apologize or formally retract it. The Mail included a retraction of the story in its Friday UK print edition. “We did not intend to state or suggest that these allegations are true,” the newspaper said, “nor did we intend to state or suggest that Mrs Trump ever worked as an ‘escort’ or in the ‘sex business’. ” It added that its article had included denials from a Trump spokesperson and the owner of the modelling agency in question, and said it regretted “any such misinterpretation”. The retraction was also posted online. “The Daily Mail newspaper and  . com have entirely separate editors and journalistic teams,” it added. “In so far as  . com published the same article it wholeheartedly also retracts the above and also regrets any such misinterpretation. ” Asked if the retraction would affect the suit, Harder replied: “It does not. ” Tarpley’s blogpost, which has been retracted, claimed, per the suit, that “it is widely known Melania was not a working model but rather a   escort” and that she had a “mental breakdown” after a plagiarism controversy over her speech to the Republican national convention in Cleveland in July. Harder is best known for representing Hulk Hogan in the lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker Media and forced its sale to Univision last month. That suit was funded by the Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, a vocal Trump supporter. Steve Klepper, an appellate lawyer for the Baltimore law firm Kramon  Graham, said the inclusion of a blogger in the suit indicated legal maneuvering. He told the Guardian: “Any time you have a filing that adds a minor   defendant, it’s a flag that they were joined to prevent removal to federal court. And as we know, Donald Trump has not been having been the best luck in federal court recently. ” Klepper pointed to a Maryland defamation statute that might provide a basis for Melania Trump’s suit. It reads: “A single or married woman whose character or reputation for chastity is defamed by any person may maintain an action against that person. ” He added, however: “Montgomery County has possibly the   college education jury pool in the whole country and I cannot see how the jury pool would be good for [Melania Trump]. ” News of the lawsuit came 68 days before the election, on the day Donald Trump pledged to promote “patriotism” in schools and a day after he gave a hardline immigration policy speech, hours after striking conciliatory notes on the topic in a meeting with the Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto. The Republican nominee, who has consistently trailed Hillary Clinton in the polls, has developed a combative relationship with the media, blacklisting a number of news outlets and pledging to pass stricter libel laws if elected. A Trump campaign spokesperson told the Guardian: “We do not have anything in addition to the Harder statement. ” The Daily Mail responded to a request for comment by pointing to its online and print retractions.

Controversial British designer behind planned $150m New York sculpture
A controversial British designer is behind an audacious $150m public art structure nicknamed the Stairway to Nowhere planned for a new   dollar commercial development on New York City’s west side. Thomas Heatherwick’s design of a giant,   collection of   staircases that will give the public fresh views of the city was unveiled in New York on Wednesday and is currently under construction in Italy. But the choice of Heatherwick for the project is likely to raise eyebrows in Britain, since he is the designer behind the planned Garden bridge over the Thames in London, which has stirred much controversy. Public funding of the bridge is under investigation, and an expert report has projected that, if built, it may rely on further money from the taxpayer to cover its running costs. However, the private company behind the New York project said on Thursday, that it was “not concerned that there will be cost overruns on a large scale” for the staircase piece, even though the cost has already doubled from the original estimate of $75m, according to the New York Times. Heatherwick’s new piece is officially called “Vessel” and will incorporate 2, 500 stairs in a bold,   structure standing within a new plaza with trees, paths and flowerbeds, surrounded by skyscrapers. The new landmark is intended to be a stunning spectacle of public art while also being entirely accessible to the public, including an elevator to the top, which is expected to be 15 storeys high. Vessel will be positioned close to the Hudson river on the west side of Manhattan in Hudson Yards, a   former industrial   where new office buildings and luxury apartment blocks are now springing up. Hudson Yards surrounds the uptown end of the enormously popular High Line park that was built on a disused elevated railway line and, since opening in 2009, has held a magnetic attraction for New Yorkers and tourists alike to the neglected area north of the trendy Meatpacking District and Chelsea neighborhoods. Renderings of Heatherwick’s Vessel were revealed by private US developer Related Companies and its founder, billionaire Stephen Ross, who is behind the Hudson Yards development and is backing the art project. London’s proposed Garden bridge, a pedestrian link to be planted with flowers and greenery and span the river from Temple to the South Bank, was proposed by Heatherwick and others and became a pet project of Boris Johnson when he was the London mayor. But it was announced in June that the National Audit Office is investigating the use of public funds to support the bridge project. And in July, a   consulting firm predicted that official estimates of future donations to allow the bridge to operate at a profit were overly optimistic and the business plan for the project was exceptionally weak. London mayor Sadiq Khan halted some of the existing spending on the project, ahead of a review. Heatherwick had previously attracted both acclaim and controversy for his Olympic flame at the 2012 games in London. The spectacular cauldron of copper petals that rose up to form a flaming flower at the climax of the opening ceremony was hailed as one of the most original in the history of the Olympics. But a New York design firm, Atopia, claimed that they had submitted a remarkably similar idea to games organisers years before, and sued in 2013. The organisers of the London Olympics settled out of court with Atopia in 2014, although there was no admission of liability and Heatherwick maintained that the design process was categorically that of he and his team “from start to finish”. • This article was amended on 19 September 2016 to clarify details relating to public funding of the Garden bridge.

Cuba offers to pay off debt to Czech Republic in rum
  Cuba has offered to pay its old debt to the Czech Republic with goods it can spare, including its coveted rum, according to the Czech finance ministry. “The Cuban party as a possible solution presented a list of commodities   …     [including] several brands of rum,” the ministry said in a statement on Friday. Czech media put the Cuban debt at about 7bn koruna ($270m) but the ministry said it had yet to tally the total sum as talks on the repayment had only started late last year. The debt is largely the legacy of business ties between Cuba and Czechoslovakia, which split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993, four years after shedding four decades of communist rule. The largest Czech broadsheet daily Dnes quoted the deputy finance minister, Lenka Dupakova, as saying debt repayment in Cuban rum was “an interesting option”. “These are relatively unknown brands which might be good, but we would have to advertise them and generally launch them into the market,” she added. The daily said the Czech Republic  —   a country with the highest per capita beer consumption in the world  —   had imported 892 tonnes of Cuban rum worth 53m koruna ($2m) in 2015. If the entire debt were repaid in rum, the Czechs would have enough rum for 130 years at this pace. But the ministry is against such a solution. “The Czech side believes that at least part of the debt should be dealt in cash,” it said.

Where will the out-of-control Chinese space station land?
What is happening with the Chinese space station? The nation’s first prototype space station,   or “Heavenly Palace” launched into orbit in September 2011. The module reached the end of its service life earlier this year and was due to splashdown  —   eventually  —   in the Pacific Ocean. But at a recent press conference, the Chinese space agency admitted it had lost contact with the station. They did not explain what had gone wrong. Does losing contact matter? It depends what the Chinese planned to do next. If the agency was going to let the spacecraft simply fall to Earth in an uncontrolled way and burn up in the atmosphere, then the loss of contact means little. But if they had intended to perform a controlled   that option is now gone. Controlled   tend to be reserved for spacecraft that pose a potential risk to people when they fall back to Earth. If the chances of someone being injured by components that survive the fireball of   is greater than one in 10, 000, then the spacecraft should be actively steered into a region of the South Pacific known in the business as the “spacecraft graveyard”. The module is already below the altitude of the International Space Station (ISS) and so there is no risk of a collision on its way down. What was   for? Unlike the massive ISS, which is the size of a football field and has the living space of a   house,   is a mere 10 metres long and 3 metres wide. The Chinese used the module to practise rendezvous and docking procedures, and several taikonauts, including two women, spent time aboard after catching a ride on the Shenzhou spacecraft. Losing control of the module is more of an embarrassment to the Chinese space agency than a blow to their space programme. Two weeks ago, in a   launch, the Chinese put another space station module,   into orbit, and a crew of at least two taikonauts is expected to visit as early as next month. The agency still hopes to build a   space station by 2020. Will the stricken module survive  ? Satellite tracking radar show the Chinese module at 380km high and travelling at 27, 500km per hour. At that speed and altitude, it could lap the planet 5, 000 more times before it starts to feel the drag of the upper atmosphere and begin its final descent. Most of the 8.  module will burn up from aerodynamic heating in the Earth’s atmosphere. But the Chinese space agency has conceded that some   components may survive. “The module is predominantly a hollow shell, so there’s a good chance a significant portion will burn up in the atmosphere. But there’s also a chance some elements will survive down to surface,” said Hugh Lewis, a space debris expert at University of Southampton. Where will it come down? No one knows. And the vagaries of   mean it will be impossible to predict with accuracy, even in its final moments. Computer simulations cannot tell far in advance on which orbit a spacecraft will  . The   is moving fast, at a shallow angle relative to the atmosphere, and the height of the atmosphere at any point depends on the regional temperature. But even when an object has begun its descent through the atmosphere, the final resting place of debris is still hard to predict. How the spacecraft tumbles through the atmosphere has an influence on how it breaks up. The most space agencies can do is calculate a debris ellipse where fragments are expected to land. Are we in danger? Pieces of space debris fall to Earth every day, but most of these are small fragments. Now and again, whole satellites or rocket stages tumble out of orbit and break apart in the sky. The most dangerous uncontrolled   happened in 1979 when Nasa’s   Skylab space station came down over Australia. In 2001, when the Russian Mir space station had reached the end of its life, Roscosmos   the   outpost into the Pacific. But even with so much hardware raining from the skies, no one is known to have been hurt by falling space junk. “It is luck, but it proves that luck is on our side,” said Lewis. The odds are wildly in favour of not being hit because most of the Earth’s surface is covered with water, and most of the world’s population is crammed into a small percentage of land. The chances of a specific individual being struck by falling debris is trillions to one, making death by lightning far more likely.

Trump campaign doubles spending but staff is a tenth the size of Clinton’s
Donald Trump’s campaign doubled its spending in July, even though the Republican nominee still only employed about 80 people, aired no television ads and maintained ties with his fired campaign manager and the writer who plagiarized part of his wife’s convention speech. His campaign lags far behind that of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, whose team spent about twice as much as his did last month. Clinton also raised more funds, taking in $52m for her campaign and Democrats, according to July filings with the Federal Election Commission, while Trump raised $37m for his campaign and Republicans. Trump’s largest expenses in July were from a new push for online fundraising, as he moved away from donating to his own campaign and more actively solicited money from voters. Trump has given about $52m to his own campaign, but is no longer   the bulk of the effort through loans or donations. The campaign paid a   web design and marketing firm,   $8. 4m in July, about twice as much as it made over the last year. The firm’s president, Brad Parscale, is digital director for Trump’s campaign, and has worked for Trump’s real estate business since 2011.  Trump’s campaign also paid $20, 000 to the consulting firm of Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager he fired in June, two weeks after Lewandowski left the campaign and became a paid pundit on CNN. The sum was roughly equal to how much Trump’s campaign paid him as manager. The campaign also paid $356. 01 to Meredith McIver, an employee of the Trump Organization who took the blame for plagiarizing Michelle Obama’s 2008 convention speech for use in Melania Trump’s 2016 speech. McIver is listed as a   for several of Donald Trump’s books, and because of her work as an “ ” writer for Trump’s private business, the campaign risked violating campaign laws if it had not separately paid her. Though the financial documents show little sign that Trump has opened offices around swing states, Trump did show some signs of scaling up for the general election. He paid $100, 000 to Cambridge Analytics, a data analysis firm that formerly worked for Senator Ted Cruz and has ties to Robert Mercer, a hedge fund billionaire who supports Trump. He also paid his Alabama state director, Chess Bedsole, $64, 000, three times his last payment, in December, even though Alabama has voted Republican for decades. The campaign paid about $2m for private jets and $500, 000 to pay for expenses on Trump’s personal plane. Last month, Trump paid more than $773, 000 to companies he owns since the beginning of the race, his campaign has paid more than $7. 5m to Trump companies or those owned by family members. In all, his campaign spent $18. 5m in July, including $1. 8m on hats and merchandise. Clinton, in contrast, reported 703 staffers, $2m on travel and signs of new offices. In July, her campaign spent a total of $38m, filings show, mostly on advertising. Last week, Trump spent $4. 8m on his first general election ads, which aired in four swing states. Trump’s personal finances remain mostly opaque, since the candidate has refused to release his tax returns  —   breaking 40 years of precedent by presidential nominees  —   and because his business is structured in a labyrinth of holdings, third parties and debt. A New York Times investigation into Trump’s finances found he had at least $650m in debt, far more than he disclosed on earlier FEC forms. Trump has said he will not release his returns while they are under an IRS audit, though no law prohibits that release. Clinton has released several years of tax returns, including from 2015, when she and her husband made nearly $11m. But she has been haunted by the web of donors, including foreign governments, that give to the family’s sprawling Clinton Foundation. The philanthropic organization has said it will no longer accept foreign donations if Clinton is elected president, but her campaign manager, Robby Mook, refused to say that it would stop taking those donations during the campaign. Political action committees allied with Democrats were boosted by several billionaires, filings also show. George Soros gave $1. 5m to a Planned Parenthood Super Pac and $500, 000 to the Senate Majority Pac, and Tom Steyer gave $7m to his own Super Pac, called NextGen Climate Action Committee. Michael Bloomberg gave $5m to his own group, called Independence USA, and though the former New York mayor has endorsed Clinton, his Pac is also working to help Pennsylvania’s Republican senator, Pat Toomey, because of his support for gun control measures. Conservative billionaires have largely shied from donating to Trump’s campaign, and filings showed that Paul Singer and Charles and David Koch are concentrating on groups to support Senate and House candidates. Mercer, on the other hand, has given $2m to a   Super Pac, and also funds Breitbart News, whose boss, Stephen Bannon, took control of Trump’s presidential campaign last week.

Unknown pleasures: why rappers like Danny Brown love Joy Division
If rappers are the new rock stars perhaps it’s because so many of them seem to be cognizant of the old ones. On Tuesday, Danny Brown, one of rap’s most interesting voices, released his new album, Atrocity Exhibition, named after a Joy Division song (itself named after the book by JG Ballard). Brown has a longstanding relationship with the band. In a 2013 Guardian interview, he cited Ian Curtis as an influence, and the band have informed his music since 2011’s album XXX.  Brown told Rolling Stone that he named the album Atrocity Exhibition because he identified with Curtis’s pain in the song  —   the authenticity of which received terrible confirmation when the singer hanged himself in 1980, aged 23. “I just relate to that song a lot,” he said. “That song, [Ian Curtis is] pretty much talking about how he feels like he’s part of a freak show almost. People just wanna come see him and they just wanna see him be a certain type of way. I totally relate to that. ”  Though Joy Division and Danny Brown  —   or even   and rap  —   may seem to exist on opposite ends of the spectrum, there is definitely an emotional through line that links the two. The band’s influence has added a dark tint to the sounds and aesthetics of two generations of backpack and avant garde rappers. Tyler, the Creator, who once called Odd Future “the new Sex Pistols” rapped that he was a “  Ian Curtis” on Leather Head. Earl Sweatshirt played Decades on a keyboard during his interview last year. Memphis rapper Cities Aviv referred to Curtis’ death on his mixtape Black Pleasure. Lupe Fiasco paid tribute to Joy Division with his band Japanese Cartoon. Kanye West asked designer Peter Saville, who created Joy Division’s iconic record sleeves, to design his logo. Vince Staples has said that Joy Division’s Unknown Pleasures inspired his debut album, Summertime 06. (They were all following in the footsteps of Grace Jones, who released a scarifying reggae cover of She’s Lost Control in 1980.) In an interview with RBMA, Staples touched on why so many rap artists respond to Joy Division. “BB King and Ian Curtis sing about the same things,” he said. “It’s all life. In   specifically, everything is sectioned off   …     Why are we still trying to limit ourselves?” Rappers attempting to push the boundaries of   have often attempted to incorporate kinds of music traditionally circumscribed by the genre. As for the lyrics, the themes of many Joy Division songs  —   failure, crisis, loss and depression  —   are as relatable to rappers as they are to anyone else. It goes without saying that Joy Division are far from the only white rock band to have inspired current rappers. OG Maco, whose breakout hit, U Guessed It, went viral in 2014, recently released an EP called Blvk Phil Collins, a nod to the Genesis frontman. Aesop Rock has long cited folk rockers the Mountain Goats and   John Darnielle as one of his primary inspirations for his densely packed lyrics. Lil B once released a song “featuring” Elliott Smith, while Mac Miller’s producer alter ego Larry Fisherman later covered Angeles. Rappers often see their own reflections in the most unlikely places. During his 2014 Lollapalooza set, Vic Mensa covered the White Stripes’ Seven Nation Army, invoking the band as a means to rile the crowd up. Azealia Banks has long been an Interpol fanatic. She covered Slow Hands early in her career, and later said it was a dream of hers to be in the band. Lil Uzi Vert, a rapper the Fader called the “first rock star of   rap” has been vocal about his Marilyn Manson fandom. “Listen here, at age 27 I will leave this Earth for this man right here,” Uzi said of Manson in a Nardwuar interview. “He’s the Pale Emperor. ” Some connections make more sense than others. It’s easy to trace Coldplay’s influence on Atlanta bubblegum pop rapper Lil Yachty (who once said his favorite album of   is Ghost Stories) whose sugary synth confections often evoke a strawberry swing. Of course rappers are inspiring rockers, too. Earlier this year, Young Thug wrote a song called Rocket Man (whose title later changed to Elton and again to Kanye West on his mixtape JEFFERY) as a tribute to Elton John. John, in turn, said he was a fan of Thug’s: “I heard a track on Beats 1 and I loved it so much. ” Iggy Pop also recently   the Atlanta rapper. With his flamboyance, rebelliousness and gender fluidity, in his own way, Young Thug carries on the legacies of both Iggy and Elton. The rappers and the punks and the glam rockers aren’t really all that different. As genres continue to blur and artists become increasingly harder to categorize, perhaps we should be less surprised that they often understand each other.

Johnny Marr: ‘When the Smiths went to No 1, we were surviving off crisps, chocolate and Coca-Cola’
I’m extremely  . I believe cucumbers are demonic, the black hole of the food world, infusing everything close by with their evil  . I didn’t actually try cucumber until 18 and I avoided them since. Which became more difficult after going vegetarian and even more difficult after going vegan. My first memories are of being   with food. I couldn’t stand cabbage, onions, courgettes especially. Dad would be starving for Irish stew after laying pipes all day, so it was all about him getting his food. I’d often hide food on my plate and just try to get meals over with as quickly as possible. Memories of being confronted by lunches at Sacred Heart primary are traumatic for me. All I really cared about was music, clothes, booze, cigarettes and drugs  —   until I was 25. The closest I came to food shopping was using a shopping trolley to carry a Vox AC30 amp. When the Smiths went to No 1 we were still surviving off potatoes, crisps, chocolates and  . The second time I ever flew was to New York. After a night at CBGB we’d roll out of bed and go straight to the local diner and there we discovered hash browns and eggs over easy and orange juice. It was probably the healthiest food I’d eaten until that point and probably got me off E numbers briefly. From the minute we made Meat is Murder I never ate meat again. Of course not I couldn’t be hypocritical. It wasn’t much of a sacrifice, to be honest, as nutrition still meant nothing to me. If you look at photos from that time I’m   and seven stone. I still miss cheese, because I ate a lot before going vegan. To say it was to clean myself of drink or drugs is a bit reductive. I’m a different beast. I just like the idea of change. I’m a vegan who avoids desserts now, but if you see me in a year I might be eating vegan Victoria sponge cake. Because I’m naturally a   Mancunian guitar player, to find myself becoming a marathon runner was an unusual thing. But if Bob Marley could get up at the crack of dawn to go running, then I can. This morning I ran 15 miles. Some days I’ll just do 10, others 20. You just get up and do it. After a full marathon I’m craving the biggest, saltiest pizza ever invented. My tour rider looks like the deli in Whole Foods. Salads, stuffed vine leaves, chilli or wasabi, rice, white tea, health bars, spinach, tofu and porridge.

The Fourth of July: how to celebrate in your 20s and 30s
The Fourth of July used to be one of my favorite holidays, but the significance of the day has changed since the halcyon days of slip’n’slides and flat soda pop. When I was a kid, it was all fireworks and good cheer, plus the kind of pure, unadulterated patriotism that only the young  —   and blissfully unaware of our country’s international foreign policy  —   can tap into. As an irresponsible    I made the Fourth a bit of a   bacchanal of cheap hot dogs, lukewarm beer, and far more illicit fireworks purchased from Mexico. Now, all I can think about is how to keep my dog from freaking out over the constant popping sounds in our neighborhood, whether or not the people at my barbecue can see my bald spot, and how soon I can go home. My point is that getting old is awful.  With age comes political awareness, higher alcohol tolerance, and an earlier bedtime. But it’s possible to be a responsible, perpetually harried adult and still enjoy yourself this weekend. Here’s how. Fun: As a kid, the Fourth means indulging in carbonated beverages in unlimited quantities. I could drink an entire   bottle of Pepsi by myself if I really applied myself. The rest of my Fourth of July barbecue experience was running around, avoiding pools (I couldn’t swim, as you might know) and appreciating the rare opportunity to go   without my mother worrying I’d step on a nail and get tetanus. Patriotism: It’s easy to be a patriot when you’re a kid, especially in my case as my father was in the Air Force. He was sent to Saudi Arabia during the first Gulf war, which meant we were even more patriotic than usual during that whole period. I was the proud owner of numerous Gulf war trading cards and at least one plastic Army tank toy. In short, I thought of America’s role in the world being similar to a game of Missile Command. Fireworks: My dad was really particular about safety with fireworks. We’d have to stay at least 15ft away from the explosion, and he always kept a bucket of water handy in case things got out of control. Every year he’d get those snakes that all kids hate. You light a black disc on fire and it expands into something that resembles rat excrement. If you get to hold the sparkler, you’re really doing well for yourself. Fun: In your 20s, the Fourth means getting blackout drunk and usually throwing up on someone’s backyard. The question isn’t so much what to drink, but how early to start? My evenings always ended the same way: eating leftover potato salad and watching Fight Club on DVD or bootleg torrents of Family Guy. I had horrible taste. The biggest difference in Fourth of July festivities in your 20s is that you don’t have a backyard any more. You probably have some crappy apartment or dorm that may or may not have a hardly luxurious patch of astroturf. Maybe you can dupe your one friend who has a rooftop to throw a party, but is it really the same? You’re older now, but not old enough to appreciate that you aren’t dead.  Patriotism: America’s a bummer, man. My 20s took place during the Bush years, so I was especially angsty about the United States. The Fourth became an ironic occasion for me and my filthy leftist friends. Who could wear the tackiest   outfit? Who could recite the entire monologue from Independence Day? Look at us, drinking Budweiser and smoking Marlboros. America, LOL! It was insufferable. Fireworks: Fireworks in your 20s are usually influenced by the amount of alcohol you’ve had beforehand. In my   I would routinely go to a party hosted by my friend Josh. He’d get really drunk and try to light a sparkler with his cigarette. Illegal fireworks became a bit like scoring drugs back then. You knew a guy who knew a guy who could get you a crate full of shit that could set your entire block on fire. Fun: Here’s the same conversation I anticipate having at every party I attend: “Do you have any IPAs? My wife loves IPAs. I brought rosé. It’s such a hot day. Doesn’t that sound refreshing? Where’s your bathroom? When’s your wedding again? October. Oh, the rosé? I just finished it. Well, good to see you again. Give your parents my best. I’m just going to wait outside for my Uber. Can I bum a cigarette? I’ll give you a dollar. ” Food becomes far more important when you’re a proper adult. There will be vegans at your party. There will be guests who are  . There might even be some pregnant women who demand pickles dipped in ranch dressing.  It’s polite to bring something to any party, but especially a Fourth of July barbecue. These are communal affairs, and you need to chip in. But what do you bring? Bearing in mind the unique restrictions that govern your fellow partygoers, you must bring something that’s edible for everyone: healthy, but not too healthy   but not veggie dogs or veggie burgers. Invariably, veggie dogs get eaten by   who then feel put upon by carnivores who steal their food. Best to not create that clear division.  I suggest apple pie.  The point is not to make yourself happy, it’s to satisfy a social obligation, so just purchase a thing that has a patriotic significance and can be consumed by just about everyone. Pro tip: get a   one and only tell the people who are  . That way, no one turns their nose up at it. Patriotism: By the time you hit 30, your country has let you down numerous times. No matter what side of the ideological spectrum you’re on, you will probably end up finding something to complain about: taxes being too high, taxes being too low, the damn Democrats, the shifty Republicans, the cost of medical care, the proliferation of guns, the lack of guns, the crummy US soccer team, and of course, whomever the president is. The United States to a person past the age of 30 is nothing more than a stuffy debt collector that also happens to be a huge prude. Fireworks: Fireworks? What fireworks? Who wants to put their kids in harm’s way like that? At most, maybe you can light them at least 15ft away from your house and keep a bucket of water on hand just in case things get out of control.

Best albums of 2016: No 3 Blackstar by David Bowie
To say that David Bowie’s final album was coloured by his death two days after its release, and the revelation that he recorded it beneath the terminal shadow of cancer, would be an understatement. It was flooded by it. Few albums have ever been subjected to so much exegesis so quickly. Was the central image, coming from the author of Starman and multiple ruminations on stardom, an act of  ? Were the lyrics of Lazarus (“Look up here, I’m in heaven”) not just a reference to the lead character in Bowie’s confounding stage musical, an alien trapped in a Manhattan purgatory between life and death, but a loaded farewell? And what about those allusions to Elvis, Aleister Crowley, cosmology and the villa of Ormen? What did it all mean? One thing is certain. Regardless of the circumstances or the   Blackstar ranks among Bowie’s very best albums. Blackstar is a   world. Despite drawing inspiration from recent albums by D’Angelo and Kendrick Lamar, and featuring percussion from LCD Soundsystem’s James Murphy, it never strains to be    like his 90s albums Outside and Earthling. Nor does it reference Bowie’s past as blatantly as his 2013 comeback The Next Day. Instead, he struck out for the fringes, the dark corners, the shadowlands, looking for one last new way to be David Bowie  —   one final incandescent flare of creativity. Bowie was always a consummate collaborator who sought out great players to facilitate each transition. Saxophonist Donny McCaslin’s   jazz band, especially the extraordinary drummer Mark Guiliana, enabled him to go in several directions at once. The song Blackstar opens like a black mass, with an   of dread, fades into the gloaming,   as a torch song, twists into a funk chant and loops back to the first section with twice the power. It’s as commandingly ambitious a composition as Station to Station, the title track of the album with which Blackstar shares the most DNA. Like Station to Station, Blackstar is an inky labyrinth of human cruelty and frailty shot through with moments of grace and transcendence, and obsessed with different kinds of transformation. And it’s another record on which each song carves out its own unique space, with no room for repetitions or redundancies. Even Bowie’s voice never does the same thing twice. It’s haunted, wired, seductive, menacing, mischievous, kind: a final multifaceted performance from pop’s great actor.  There is panic and brutality in the surly nadsat paranoia of Girl Loves Me the murderous sexual jealousy of febrile drum’n’bass psychodrama Sue (Or in a Season of Crime) and the cackling vulgarity of ’Tis Pity She Was a Whore, a   fable of sex and violence. Then there are songs of liberation and transmogrification. On Lazarus, death becomes a kind of freedom. Dollar Days is an expat’s farewell to “the English evergreens” and a plea for more time. I Can’t Give Everything Away pivots on the title’s poignant double meaning: a refusal to explain himself and a reluctance to let go. The wistful harmonica nods to A New Career in a New Town from Low, while McCaslin’s saxophone, often an agent of chaos, becomes a means of elevation, sending the record spiraling into the sky, out of view. “I know something is very wrong,” Bowie sings on the final track, and indeed it was, but then he was always fascinated by lives wrenched out of joint. And long before he was ill, he was preoccupied with death: the looming darkness that makes the light so much brighter. In 2002, Interview magazine editor Ingrid Sischy asked Bowie what he felt the point of art was. “It’s a   dichotomy  —   of the lust for life against the finality of everything,” he replied. “It’s those two things raging against each other, you know? And that produces these moments that feel like real truth   …     That is the entire story, right there. That’s it. There’s no more to be said. ” Blackstar says it beautifully.

Temple Taggart: Donald Trump wants to ’silence his accusers’ with legal threats
One of the women accusing Donald Trump of inappropriate sexual behavior, Temple Taggart, a former Miss Utah, said on Friday she was ready to countersue the Republican presidential candidate if he carried out his promise to sue all of his accusers. Taggart, who has accused Trump of kissing her on the lips without consent, is one of 12 women who have come forward since the publication of a 2005 Access Hollywood tape in which the businessman boasted of kissing and groping women without their consent. Trump, who has denied all accusations against him, said last weekend he would sue all his accusers after the presidential election. Taggart, who has hired the lawyer Gloria Allred, said on Friday: “I’m not afraid of you, Mr Trump. If you carry out your threat to sue me, I will defend myself. ” Speaking alongside Allred at a press conference in Utah, Taggart said: “I felt like Mr Trump was trying to silence all of his accusers who had come forward, as well as others who might be thinking of coming forward. “Enough is enough. I feel like he is trying to bully and frighten us into silence. Mr Trump, that is not going to work with me. ” Another of the 12 women who have accused Trump, Jill Harth, said on Monday she would countersue if Trump pursued legal action against her. Taggart first spoke of Trump’s alleged actions in May, telling the New York Times he kissed her twice on the mouth in 1997, when she was a    contestant in the Miss USA pageant. The first instance allegedly took place when she first met the businessman, at a pageant rehearsal. “Mr Trump greeted me with a hug and a kiss on my lips,” Taggart, who said she had been very naive and “21 going on 16” said on Friday. “I was shocked because that was the first time that any man had ever greeted me in that manner, but I ended up excusing his behavior as a way that east coast people meet each other. ” She said the second alleged incident took place when she travelled to New York later that year, to discuss her future with Trump and to meet modeling agencies. “To my surprise, Trump embraced me and kissed me on the lips for a second time,” she said. “It was that second kiss that made me wonder what his intentions really were. “What he did made me feel so uncomfortable that I ended up cutting my trip short, bought my own plane ticket, flew home and never spoke to him again. ” Taggart, a Republican who says she will probably vote for the independent conservative candidate Evan McMullin, said she wanted to make sure that other women feel comfortable coming forward and not frightened that Trump will call them “liars” and threaten legal action. “Times have changed,” said the mother of three. “Women are empowered now. And we will not tolerate being bullied any more. ” Allred represents four women who allege inappropriate sexual behavior by the Republican nominee. “Groping women is completely unacceptable,” she said. “Threatening women who come forward to speak out about what they claim happened to them is also completely unacceptable. “I assure you, Mr Trump, they will not be left to stand alone while you attempt to trample over them with your lawsuits. Many attorneys will come to their aid. And I will be one of them. ” Allred has a history of representing women in sexual harassment and misconduct cases, including 33 women who have accused comedian Bill Cosby of sexual misconduct.

Tragic, fascinating, brilliant – life of ‘wild child’ Zelda Fitzgerald revisited
She is thought of as the original wild child, a   party girl who died at the age of 47 after a fire broke out in the North Carolina sanatorium where she was a patient. Now Zelda Fitzgerald, the southern belle turned   heroine, dubbed “the first American flapper” by her husband and    Scott, is to have her own Hollywood    —   two films are in the pipeline and a television series will air on Amazon Prime early next year. All three projects have starry names attached: Jennifer Lawrence will take the lead in Zelda, a biopic directed by Ron Howard and based on Nancy Milford’s   biography Scarlett Johansson will bob her hair for The Beautiful and The Damned and Christina Ricci will play the young and impetuous Zelda in the Amazon series Z: The Beginning of Everything. The title of the TV series comes from Scott’s awestruck comment on meeting Zelda: “I love her, and that’s the beginning and end of everything. ” So what is it about Zelda that fascinates almost 70 years after her tragic end? In part it is that the upheavals the couple lived through find an echo in our own tumultuous times. “Interest in the Fitzgeralds has definitely been on the increase  —   not only since Baz Luhrmann’s film of The Great Gatsby in 2013 but also from the many parallels between their lives and work and the period we’re living through right now,” says Sarah Churchwell, author of the critically acclaimed Careless People: Murder, Mayhem and The Invention of the Great Gatsby. “It’s a story of boom and bust and it resonates as we are grappling with our own boom and bust, our own worries about the cost of our excesses and our own social failures. The lives and fortunes of Scott and Zelda peculiarly mimicked their eras: in the 1920s they were roaring for all they were worth, but with the crash in 1929, everything fell apart. ” It helps, too, that Zelda was so vibrant a figure. “It begins with her beauty,” says Churchwell. “But also with the stories told in the 1920s about the high jinks and fun she and Scott seemed to have. People really liked her: she was surprising, intelligent, shrewd, funny and loved a good party. She also liked to be the centre of attention, and so had her detractors too. These things combined to make her a legend. ” Scott repeatedly returned to their relationship in his fiction, most notably in his second novel, The Beautiful and Damned, which details the heady early days of their marriage and his melancholy fourth, Tender Is The Night, in which the gilded dream has faded into a more tawdry reality. Zelda’s only novel, Save Me The Waltz, presented the relationship from her side. They were arguably America’s first celebrity pairing: a carefree golden couple who wrote their way into the spotlight, creating their own mythology of   days and   nights, only to linger too long once the light had started to dim. “Their recklessness makes the story exciting and dramatic,” says Churchwell. “But they paid a very high price. ” After a few giddy years, all the youthful promise crumbled away, leaving Scott a dazed and drunk jobbing hack in Hollywood and bringing Zelda to breakdown at the age of 30, a diagnosis of schizophrenia, now widely thought to be a bipolar disorder, and a life in and out of sanatoriums. “Her story is both fascinating and tragic,” says Therese Anne Fowler, on whose novel Z the Amazon series is based. “Here we have a woman whose talents and energy and intellect should have made her a brilliant success, who was determined to be an accomplished artist, writer and ballet dancer in an era where married women were supposed to be wives and mothers, period. Her devotion to Scott was, in many ways, her undoing [although] he was just as imprisoned as she was. Had they loved each other less, they might both have come to better ends. ” The idea of Zelda as a brilliant woman trapped by her time has gained traction in recent years, with a number of works   her through the prism of feminism  —   although it is not always the easiest of fits. As early as 1974, the couple’s daughter Scottie resisted such claims, writing that attempts to view her mother as a “classic ‘ ’ wife, whose efforts to express her nature were thwarted by a typically male chauvinist husband” were not accurate. Writing in the New Yorker in 2013, Molly Fischer agreed, noting: “Saving Zelda Fitzgerald is no easy proposition. ..[she] does not want to be anyone’s pet, and there’s something disconcerting about the literary readiness to domesticate her, to transform an exasperating woman into an appealing heroine. ” The new films may well further “Hollywoodise” Zelda, sanding away her rough edges and reinventing her as a relatable heroine for our modern times. The casting of Lawrence  —   so often described as “America’s Sweetheart”  —   in the Howard biopic is no accident. A report about the upcoming Johansson film in the Hollywood Reporter suggested it would draw on previously unreleased material to “indicate that her husband misappropriated his wife’s ideas as his own”. Mark Gill, president of Millennium Films, the production company behind The Beautiful and The Damned, agrees: “She was massively ahead of her time and she took a beating for it. He stole her ideas and put them in his books. The marriage was a codependency from hell with a   soundtrack. ” The film has, however, secured the   of the Fitzgerald estate. Fowler agrees that there is a growing tendency to apply our own concerns to Zelda. “We do anoint her as a kind of   heroine, even though she didn’t see herself as a feminist and didn’t fully succeed at anything,” she says. “But her original reputation is based on conventional paternalistic standards of what a woman, mother and wife ought to be and do. Her ambitions and her insistence on pursuing them were considered inappropriate and unhealthy after her psychotic break she was literally told that this insistence had created her ‘split mind’ and that the path to a cure lay in giving up all ambitions that didn’t conform to the paternalistic ideal. ” The backlash against this image is understandable given that popular opinion of Zelda was initially driven by Ernest Hemingway’s notoriously caustic descriptions in A Moveable Feast, published posthumously in 1964, in which he dismissed her as insane and blamed Scott’s growing dependence on drink on his wife. “Our perception has very much changed,” says Churchwell. “We have come to sympathise with her frustration, to recognise her gifts and to be more   about her choices. ” That said, she cautions against attempts to create a Team   Zelda divide, as is so often the case in famous literary partnerships. “It’s important to say that they always loved each other and wouldn’t have appreciated people taking sides  …     Fitzgerald wrote a few years before he died that it was a ‘moral imperative’ that their friends understood they were a couple, a unit and would stay that way, even if her illness meant they couldn’t live together. ” Churchwell is also scathing about attempts to suggest Zelda had a larger role in her husband’s work than previously presumed. “There are people who want to credit Zelda with Scott’s work, which is just silly and doesn’t do women any favours,” she says. “It’s not a   game: we can recognise both of them for who they were. “Zelda had many talents, but where writing was concerned she was probably too ill when she started to hone her gifts, and while it is true that Scott didn’t particularly want her to write  —   partly out of territoriality but partly because her doctors told him it was bad for her  —   it’s also true that her work isn’t in the same class as his  …    . Her individual sentences are often lovely, and she can create a mood and has clever turns of phrase but her works tend to be sketches rather than full stories. If they had made different choices, maybe she could have been an important writer, but the reality is that she wasn’t. ” Perhaps, then, the true key to Zelda’s continued pull on our imagination lies not in her work but in her modernity. “I don’t want to live  —   I want to love first and live incidentally,” she proclaimed and it is that vitality and greed for all of life’s experiences, both good and bad, that stretches down over the decades, allowing each generation to see something new. Z: The Beginning of Everything will air on Amazon Prime early next year, ‘I have rarely known a woman who expressed herself so delightfully and freshly: she had no   phrases on the one hand and no striving for effect on the other.’ Critic Edmund Wilson, ‘I fell in love with her courage, her sincerity and her flaming   and it’s these things I would believe in even if the whole world indulged in wild suspicions that she wasn’t all that she should be.’ F Scott Fitzgerald, ‘I did not have a single feeling of inferiority, or shyness, or doubt, and no moral principles.’ ‘All I want is to be very young always and very irresponsible, and to feel that my life is my own to live and be happy and die in my own way to please myself.’ ‘Other people’s ideas of us are dependent largely on what they’ve hoped for.’

Larry King got $225,000 to interview Ukraine PM, says politician
The TV host Larry King accepted $225, 000 (£173, 000) to interview Ukraine’s   prime minister, according to a politician investigating a “black ledger” detailing alleged secret payments to the US from Ukraine’s former ruling party. King flew to Kiev in November 2011 to interview Ukraine’s then prime minister Mykola Azarov. Azarov was a key figure in the government of President Viktor Yanukovych, whom Ukrainian prosecutors accuse of massive corruption. Weeks before the interview Yanukovych had jailed his main political opponent Yulia Tymoshenko. After the interview King lavished praise on Azarov, describing him in flattering terms as a “straightforward and honest person with a deep knowledge of world affairs”. Speaking to journalists in Kiev at the time, King said: “After the interview I told my wife that he [Azarov] would have been a successful US politician. As for who he reminded me, he’s a bit like Jimmy Carter. He looks good, and it’s easy to meet with him. ” During the encounter King asked Azarov a series of softball questions, including: “What do you like most about your job?” “Why are you interested in politics?” and “How’s your health?” He mentioned Tymoshenko just once, asking Azarov: “Do you have any sympathy for her?” The latter replied: “Of course. ”  On Friday Serhiy Leshchenko, a Ukrainian MP and investigative journalist, presented fresh details from a “black ledger” belonging to Yanukovych’s Party of Regions. It includes records of $12. 7m in payments allegedly designated for Paul Manafort, then Yanukovych’s chief consultant and election strategist and who on Friday resigned as Donald Trump’s campaign manager. Leshchenko said the records documented a $225, 000 payment earmarked for King in return for the Azarov interview, which was broadcast by Ukraine’s   national TV station. “Money from the Party of Regions’ shadow assets was paid to Larry King. He received $225, 000 from the party’s shadow coffer,” the MP said, adding that the party had not paid taxes on its undercover slush fund.  King, who left CNN in 2010 and has gone on to work for Russia Today, was not immediately available for comment. Manafort has dismissed claims he received “black ledger” cash payments as “unfounded, silly and nonsensical”. Sources close to Manafort said he was not involved in flying King to Kiev. Rather, it was Azarov’s own press team that came up with the “stupid idea” and arranged the trip, they suggested. But the alleged Larry King payment appears part of a wider strategy by the then ruling Party of Regions to influence US opinion and to deflect criticism of Yanukovych’s increasingly authoritarian behaviour. The Associated Press reported on Thursday that Manafort’s firm had run a covert Washington lobbying operation. Its goal was to win positive press coverage in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, and to undercut public sympathy for the jailed Tymoshenko. At the time the EU and Obama administration were calling for her to be freed. Between 2012 and 2014 Manafort’s colleague Rick Gates directed two Washington lobbying firms, Mercury LLC and the Podesta Group, to set up meetings between senators and Ukrainian government officials, the AP said. The firms were paid $2. 2m via a   “thinktank” the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine. The “black ledger” was found in the Party of Regions office in 2014, shortly after Yanukovych and Azarov escaped to Russia following mass   protests. Ukrainian prosecutors accuse Yanukovych of being behind the shooting of 100 demonstrators and stealing $100bn. An international arrest warrant is outstanding against Azarov.  On Friday, Leshchenko, a member of President Petro Poroshenko’s parliamentary faction, said interrogating Manafort may shed light on the alleged secret payments.  “Manafort didn’t work for free in Ukraine. He served the Party of Regions for over 10 years. It’s clear that his work was paid,” Leshchenko said. “The money was transferred in cash and it is impossible to trace the transactions, but I have no doubt as to the authenticity of these documents,” he said.  This week Ukraine’s National   bureau published 19 pages from the ledger. They showed 22 items designated for Manafort, with payments ranging from $3, 468, 693 for “Paul Manafort contract” to $6, 000 for “Manafort expenses”. Other entries were for exit polls, research, and computers. In an article for the Guardian Leshchenko writes: “  ‘shadow accounting’ documents I have seen show $400, 000 in cash payments were made to him, which were intended to be spent on conducting exit polls. The documents show a further $812, 000 to be paid to him for engaging international observers. ”  “Ukrainians are concerned about the theft of public money. We want the chain of corruption to end. That is why many are troubled that Manafort’s name has emerged in this probe. ” He adds: “Manafort worked with Yanukovych  —   one of the most notorious European politicians  —   for nearly 10 years. This is not a casual relationship between the client and the performer. Such   cooperation incorporates a general worldview and values. Now voters in America will have to ask themselves: are these values they want in their country?” The ledgers also suggest that Yanukovych’s Party of Regions was giving clandestine funding to the     Ukrainian party Svoboda, Leshchenko said on Friday. The payments were allegedly routed via one of Yanukovych’s MPs, Vitaly Kalyuzhny.

In praise of one-hit wonders
Dead Poets Society, that carpe diem bellow about a group of boys in a New England prep school and their teacher, Mr Keating (Robin Williams) is in production as an   play opening next month. It’s ostensibly a story about Neil (Robert Sean Leonard) a sensitive lad whose theatrical ambitions conflict with his authoritarian father’s preferences, and Keating, who   the boys into writing poetry and seizing the day. However, the real star of the movie is Charlie “Nuwanda” Dalton, the   of the bunch with a great deal of personal style,   lightning bolt body art and sax abilities. Nuwanda is character with an enduring fandom and cultural relevance. “Damn it Neil, the name is Nuwanda” is a phrase will always hold up a little flag for nonconformists in the face of overwhelming institutional crushing.  Nuwanda was played by Gale Hansen, who didn’t do much acting after that, while many of his classmates from Welton Academy (Leonard, Ethan Hawke, Josh Charles) have been working steadily since then.  With a play in the works, these acting trajectories will undoubtedly become the focus of renewed interest, with the “where are they now” features and listicles. One of the purposes of these types of articles, it seems to me, is to shame those who “didn’t do anything” afterwards, except for, I don’t know, live their lives. There’s an accusation there: why aren’t you more famous?  The phrase “  wonder” certainly implies that it’s a wonder you ever had a hit because you never followed it up. Your lack of   is automatically a bad thing. But why is a truly singular performance, or one number one hit, or one perfect book something to disdain? Isn’t greatness greatness? Why would it be better if, say, one had a slew of mediocre performances or songs or books? Excellence  —   having created something that people still love and connect to decades later  —   should stand regardless of whether someone goes on to be prolific. I’ve read Limahl (he of the   group Kajagoogoo) say that he doesn’t mind singing Too Shy over and over again because it means a lot to people in the audience, as it reminds them of specific moments in their youth. If you doubt that Too Shy is excellent, please take a NSFW moment and listen to the first 30 seconds.  I seem to love a strange amount of personal bests. Favorite Bond  ? George Lazenby, On her Majesty’s Secret Service. Favorite Von Trapp? Leisl, played by Charmian Carr. My favorite movie performance? Jason Miller in the Exorcist. A pitfall of onceness is that disappearance comes more easily. I love the   series Rubicon, but it’s unavailable despite having been broadcast in 2010. I happened upon a worn paperback book called the Auctioneer and read it voraciously, and wondered why the author, Joan Samson, hadn’t written any more books despite a cover line trumpeting SOON TO BE A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE. That major motion picture was never made, and Samson died of cancer. There may be a bit of fear and jealousy involved with the disdain of wonders. Fear that even if one can reach some fairly lofty heights, there’s no guarantee it will happen again, despite all efforts. Fate is fickle. Why not decades of Gale Hansen films? Sometimes the gods are just assholes. And maybe, at the core, there’s a   sadness because you, the fan, would like to have   more of that art.  But sometimes more isn’t better. See: Go Set a Watchman. I wish Hansen had appeared in more films and television shows many Dead Poets Society fans feel that way. I don’t know how he feels about it. Maybe he didn’t want to act any more. It’s a selfish wish, really, to demand that someone who gave you something precious, who created a work of art that has stayed with you for decades, give you more.  Maybe   “  wonders” are so incandescent that, perfection having been achieved, the artist can drop the mic, so to speak. This list of the top   wonders according to Spotify shows a list of songs that are still in heavy rotation on my radio regardless of its creators lacking subsequent hits.  Ongoing mediocrity is transient. But I will always turn up my radio when Groove is in the Heart comes on.

’The saga is over’: Gawker reaches $31m settlement with Hulk Hogan
Gawker Media has agreed to pay former wrestler Hulk Hogan $31m (£25m) to settle a   legal battle that forced the company to file for bankruptcy and its eponymous gossip website to close down. The news site, which filed for bankruptcy this summer after a jury ordered it to pay $140m in damages to Hogan for the website’s publication of a sex tape featuring the wrestler, agreed to forego an appeal and pay a cash settlement deal, according to legal filings on Wednesday. The lawsuit against Gawker was funded by Silicon Valley billionaire and Donald Trump donor Peter Thiel.  After four years of litigation funded by a billionaire with a grudge going back even further, a settlement has been reached, Gawker founder Nick Denton said in a blog post. “The saga is over. ” Denton, a British journalist who founded Gawker in 2002 with an aim to report on the media and establishment elite, said he was confident that the appeals court would reduce or eliminate the $140m “runaway Florida judgment”.  “But   legal war with Thiel would have cost too much, and hurt too many people, and there was no end in sight. The Valley billionaire, famously relentless, had committed publicly to support Hulk Hogan beyond the appeal and ‘until his final victory’. Gawker’s nemesis was not going away. ” As part of the settlement, three Gawker stories, including the Hogan one, will be deleted from the internet.  A spokesman for Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, said: “As with any negotiation for resolution, all parties have agreed it is time to move on. ” Thiel, a   of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook, has spent about $10m sponsoring the lawsuit against Gawker. He had also secretly funded a team of lawyers to track down “victims” of Gawker and help fund their lawsuits against the company.  He fell out with Gawker and Denton after the website outed him as gay in 2007 with the headline: “Peter Thiel is totally gay, people. ” Denton is also gay.  “It’s less about revenge and more about specific deterrence,” Thiel has said of sponsoring Hogan’s legal action. “I saw Gawker pioneer a unique and incredibly damaging way of getting attention by bullying people even when there was no connection with the public interest   …     I thought it was worth fighting back. ” He said funding the lawsuit was one of the “greater philanthropic things that I’ve done”.  Gawker Media, which included several other websites including Jezebel, Gizmodo and Deadspin, was sold out of bankruptcy to     media company Univision for $135m. Gawker was permanently closed.  Gawker started life in Denton’s Manhattan apartment with a mission to expose celebrities and the media elite. It quickly became popular for its “snarky” tone and abhorrence of PR and media spin.

’Democracy was hijacked. It got a bad name’: the death of the post-Soviet dream
The road out of Kommunizm, a small town in southern Tajikistan, is badly paved and bumpy. Like most things here it was built long ago, when the ruling ideology that gave the settlement its name was still thriving. Home to just 7, 000 inhabitants, Kommunizm was at the very edge of the Russian empire, first tsarist then Soviet a mere 50 miles from Kunduz in northern Afghanistan. All around the former collective farm is the once splendid iconography of the Bolshevik order. Busts of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin look on to what used to be the main square, while a trio of heroically poised Soviet archetypes have been cast to one side in a car park. On the stage at the Palace of Youth, a building with wide white columns and a grand central hall with gilded chandeliers, a portrait of Lenin has been replaced by the gently smiling visage of Emomali Rahmon, president of Tajikistan. But apart for the omnipresent Rahmon, there is not much new in Kommunizm. Things have merely decayed. Like the rest of Tajikistan and the four other former Soviet “Stans”  —   Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan  —   Kommunizm is marking 25 years of independence, thanks to the   collapse of the Soviet Union in the autumn of 1991. But for all the overblown rhetoric and parades across the region, the celebrations had a bittersweet tinge. While efforts at nation building in the newly independent countries have had some success, the collapse of the planned economy and its replacement with kleptocratic regimes has meant the standard of living for most people in the region has sharply declined over the past quarter of a century. In Kommunizm’s Palace of Youth, the paint peels from the walls, and visitors have to zigzag to avoid falling through rotten sections of the flooring. It is hard to avoid the weight of the metaphor. The “Stans” occupy a chunk of land that has always been at the crossroads of empires: China to the east, Russia to the north, Turkey to the west, Afghanistan and India to the south. In the 19th century, London and St Petersburg jostled over the territory in what was known as the Great Game, with the Russian and British empires just a few miles apart at points in the Pamir mountains. In the aftermath of the   attacks, the “war on terror” saw many people speak of a “new great game” as the US moved airbases into the region to support the Afghan war effort. But even as global powers jostled over central Asia, the region remained little known and mainly ignored, except for satire of its dictatorships and apparent backwardness  —   Sacha Baron Cohen’s hapless Kazakh reporter Borat, or the recent British comedy The Ambassadors, following British diplomats in (fictional) Tazbekistan. Last year, a New York Times typo saw the accidental invention of a brand new state: Kyrzbekistan.  Local intellectuals bristle at these caricatures, and point out that the region is home to many great civilisations the ornate   and   manuscripts on display at Tajikistan’s national museum are a reminder of the sophisticated societies that previously flourished here. But it is the legacy of the Soviet Union, the most recent empire to control the lands, which is most in evidence today, from the steppe of northern Kazakhstan to the cotton fields on Tajikistan’s border with Afghanistan. Across the region,   mosaics depicting happy nomads embracing socialism and strapping athletes bringing glory to the joint motherland are surrounded by decaying infrastructure.  In Kommunizm, as across the region, the socialist art is less about any real Soviet past, and more about the memory of an imagined happy future, now gone forever. “We knew things were difficult then, but the party told us that tomorrow everything would be better. We knew there was a plan and in five years or 10 years it would all be better. But now we don’t know what will happen tomorrow we’ve lost that hope,” said Medetkhan Sherimkulov, who was the Kyrgyz Soviet republic’s head of ideology in the 1980s and now teaches political science at a Bishkek university. As a bright young communist cadre, Sherimkulov earned a philosophy PhD at Moscow State University in the 1970s, specialising in transitional societies. He planned to put his knowledge to use in the continuing mission to Sovietise central Asia, but he ended up managing a shift in the opposite direction. As speaker of the first Kyrgyz parliament, it is his signature on Kyrgyzstan’s declaration of independence, ushering into existence a country he neither wanted nor expected. “We lived for 70 years with the Soviet Union you can’t expect us to transition to a democracy overnight. If you try to make the transition too quickly, chaos ensues,” said Sherimkulov over tea and plov (pilaf) in a Bishkek teahouse. “You are used to your own system, and then it changes overnight. Imagine if in England they turned it into a dictatorship overnight. You can’t transition that quickly. Democracy was hijacked by demagogues. It was spoiled, and got a bad reputation. ”  In the early 1990s, Communist party bosses in the region reincarnated themselves as national leaders, stepping into the ideological vacuum with new legends and heroes, often with scant attention to historical fact. In Astana and Ashgabat, the Kazakh and Turkmen leaderships built gaudy, fantastical cities from scratch, projections of the golden ages to which their nations were purportedly headed. Lenins were replaced by billboards of smiling presidents, just as omnipresent as the Soviet leaders once were, and equally hagiographic. In Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan, it is nearly impossible to find a point in the city from which a portrait of Rahmon is not in the sightline. Here he cradles sheaves of wheat pensively, there he sips a cup of tea or wags a finger in a meeting. Most often, in the   shots that cover the facades of whole buildings, he strides purposefully, into a glorious Tajik future that is remarkably absent from any reality existing outside the world of the billboards. The Turkmen president, Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, went even further and had a gold statue of himself erected. He has been officially styled as Arkadag, “the protector” Rahmon is the “founder of peace and national unity” while Kazakhstan’s Nursultan Nazarbayev is merely Elbasy, “leader of the nation”. There is talk of renaming the capital, Astana, in his honour. The laws anointing the men with these titles typically also provide them and their families with immunity from prosecution, and indeed, behind the personality cults and nationalism is something more basic and venal. In all five countries, family members and close associates of the rulers have enriched themselves. Central Asia is one of the world’s most corrupt regions, but foreign businessmen and politicians have had few qualms about coddling the region’s autocrats, keen to access resources and use airbases, as foreign adventurers on the silk route once courted emirs for trading rights. Moral clarity has been in short supply. The then British ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, was fired in 2004 after speaking out against human rights abuses in the country, perhaps the most repressive autocracy of them all. A decade later, and Karimov was still being courted by western politicians. “Uzbekistan is an important partner in bringing peace, prosperity to central Asia. Good discussion   President Karimov,” secretary of state John Kerry wrote on Twitter in 2015 about a man who was accused of boiling his opponents alive. Kerry accompanied the tweet with a photograph of the two men shaking hands and smiling. Karimov, who was the first secretary of the Uzbek Soviet republic and then Uzbekistan’s first president, died a few days short of his country’s 25th birthday. He left a legacy of poverty, forced labour and strict censorship. His death, rather than ushering in a period of openness, has merely seen one of his associates take over the reins.  Of the five countries, only in Kyrgyzstan has there been an enforced change of leadership revolutions twice rising up to wash away corrupt rulers, one of whom fled to Moscow and another, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, to Belarus. His son Maxim made a dash to London in his private jet, with what Kyrgyz authorities allege is hundreds of millions of dollars of pilfered public money. “I pleaded with the Americans to go after him. Putting him in an orange suit would be the best thing imaginable to happen to   relations,” said Edil Baisalov, briefly chief of staff to the interim president after the Bakiyev family was deposed in a 2010 revolution. Instead, the Americans dropped the case against him, and Bakiyev Jr is rumoured to be living comfortably in Surrey. Kyrgyzstan’s current president, Almazbek Atambayev, has gained a reputation as an impulsive and erratic leader, and International Crisis Group’s Deirdre Tynan described the country’s politics as “perpetual   chaos”. The revolution that deposed the Bakiyev clan was followed by terrible ethnic violence in southern Kyrgyzstan, where there is a large ethnic Uzbek population. More than 400 people were killed. The country’s violent recent past has led many to wonder whether a stable autocracy might be better than a relatively liberal state with revolutionary energy and freedom of speech. But while applying western standards of democracy to central Asia may be naive, there is no doubt that the dictatorships have not, on the whole, brought   prosperity. For the vast majority of citizens in the five countries, everyday life is hard work, and most are significantly worse off than during the Soviet period. The societies are still recovering from what they lost in the Soviet collapse. “In any central Asian country, if there was a referendum on some kind of integration project that would basically be a new Soviet Union, at least   of people would vote for it,” said Parviz Mullojanov, a political analyst in Dushanbe. In the 1970s, the city of Osh in southern Kyrgyzstan was around 50% Russian. Arsen Ambaryan, an ethnic Armenian lawyer who has lived in Osh most of his life, recalled that of the 30 children in his 1977   class, about 20 were Russians. Only one of them still lives in Osh.  The rest all left during the early   period. The Russians tended to be professionals: doctors, teachers, engineers, and their departure took a huge toll on the societies they left behind. Many professional Uzbeks, Kyrgyz and Tajiks also left for Russia, taking advantage of easy citizenship programmes in the 1990s. They left behind societies with poor healthcare and broken education systems. Grandparents tend to be better educated than their grandchildren across much of the region. As well as lost intellectual capital, much of the industrial infrastructure also fell into decay in the years after the Soviet collapse, as it did elsewhere in the former Soviet lands, from Siberia to east Ukraine, leaving social devastation in its wake. “Our factories were well developed and were high class by [Soviet] Union standards, but of course they couldn’t compete with European and Chinese factories. So as soon as the union collapsed, and we lost that integration and that planned economy market, everything was in trouble,” said Sherimkulov, the former party boss. With jobs in central Asia in short supply, young men have had to migrate, usually to Russia, to do unskilled labour to send money home to sustain their families. Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan have natural resources that swell the state coffers, but in the other three countries, remittances from migrant workers are what keeps the economies afloat. In Tajikistan, they account for around half of GDP. In Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, it is hard to find a man in his 20s or 30s who has not been to Russia to work. Bishkek, the Kyrgyz capital, is plastered with advertisements for buses making the gruelling   journey across the steppe to the Russian capital. Across the region, thousands of men depart each day to Moscow and other cities across Russia, where they work in grim conditions with few labour rights, for poor salaries that are nevertheless much better than they could expect at home. National borders wind their way through communities, frequently with no apparent logic. They are another difficult legacy from the Soviet period, designed to mark not international boundaries but internal administrative jurisdictions. In a situation where the new nations are creating new nationalisms, minority populations excluded from national   enhance the potential for unrest. In northern Kazakhstan, large communities of ethnic Russians make Kazakh authorities nervous about a potential “Crimea scenario”.  Further south, in the densely populated Fergana Valley, the wavy, overlapping borders of Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan are hangovers from the Soviet borders, and often appear as if drawn at random by a drunkard holding a pencil. Particularly tricky is the presence of several exclaves  —   towns belonging to one country placed well inside the borders of another. The town of Sokh, for example, is part of Uzbekistan, but fully surrounded by Kyrgyzstan, and its 20, 000 population are almost entirely ethnic Tajiks. Shepherds are frequently shot by border guards, while people trying to go to the next village for shopping or visiting relatives are subject to border checks and corrupt officials trying to extort bribes to allow them to cross. But the most alarming menace lurking at the door is radical Islam. Over the centuries, central Asian societies were traditionally Islamic, though religion was repressed in the Soviet period. In the newly independent states, Islam is back, but the paranoid regimes frown on any kind of conservative Islam, even   forms. In Turkmenistan, beards have been banned and attendance at mosques discouraged while in Tajikistan, police keep a watchlist of veiled women and men with long beards. Even in relatively liberal Kyrgyzstan, giant billboards have appeared in recent months across the country, showing women in traditional Kyrgyz dress on one side, and wearing black veils on the other, with the question posed, “Where are we headed?” With   conservative Islam frowned upon in the region, a trickle of people are moving across to violent extremism.  An Islamic State video released in 2015 purported to show dozens of young Kazakh boys receiving training and instruction at a terrorist training camp, presumably in Syria. Kazakhstan has seen two purported Isis inspired attacks this summer, including a July incident in which four police officers and one civilian were killed by gunfire in the financial capital, Almaty. Most dramatically, the chief of Tajikistan’s Omon riot police Gulmurod Khalimov, rumoured to be a   sniper and favourite of the president, disappeared last year and resurfaced in an Isis propaganda video promising to hunt down and kill Americans. While it is clear that there is a radicalism problem, rights activists say the governments have used the fight against extremism to go after moderates and dissenters. In Tajikistan, the Islamic Renaissance party, a moderate Islamic force calling for a secular state with religious freedoms, has been hounded into exile. Hundreds of its supporters have been rounded up and jailed. Shabnam Khudodoydova, a Tajik woman living in Russia, also reported persecution under the guise of a crackdown on extremism. After she began to post in opposition political forums and writing that the Rahmon regime had “made slaves and sheep” out of the Tajik people, she noticed she was being followed in St Petersburg, and fled to Belarus. There she was arrested, beaten up in custody by men she believes were Tajik security agents, and held in jail for several months, before being released and fleeing to Poland.  She later discovered she had been put on the Interpol watchlist, accused of being a recruiter for Isis. “I am not a terrorist, I’m not an Islamist, I’m actually an atheist. I’ve never even believed in God,” she said by Skype from Poland. There is now a chicken and egg situation: the governments of the region claim their repressive policies are a response to the very real threat posed by Isis and other Islamist movements.  Cynics suggest that the suffocating stranglehold on political and religious life leaves no middle ground: for those who want an escape from the confines of the regime, extremism can be the only option. “When you push out the moderate Islamic alternatives you leave more potential for people to get radicalised,” said one western diplomat based in the region. In   a town not far from Osh on the border with Uzbekistan, the imam of the local mosque, Rashot Kamalov, has been jailed for calling for an Islamic caliphate.  In a grimy teahouse not far from the town’s teeming market, Dilyar Jumabayev, a supporter of Kamalov, said the imam had not called for people to go to Syria, but merely preached about current injustices. The region, mainly made up of ethnic Uzbeks, is poor on the road from Osh the carcasses of Soviet industrial plants lie derelict and abandoned. Police keep a close eye on Jumabayev, and during one search of his house, he was beaten and had his front teeth kicked out. He was later sentenced to 10 months in prison for resisting arrest. “What has democracy brought us in 25 years? I was never a fan of the Soviet Union but at least people worked then. Now there is no work, the factories have closed. I am selling everything in my house including the refrigerator so that I can afford medicine,” he said. In Osh, lawyer Khusanbay Saliyev is dealing with hundreds of cases for possession of extremist literature, and said he believed about 90% of them to be fabricated by paranoid and avaricious authorities. “There is torture and repression, and it has the opposite effect, pushing people into the arms of the radicals,” he said. The dictatorships of central Asia are now at a crossroads. Outwardly, they appear more or less stable. Deaths of dictators, in Turkmenistan a decade ago, and this year in Uzbekistan, have led not to political change but simply to a new autocrat taking over, in what at least to outside eyes were relatively smooth processes.  All the leaders remain adept at playing off major powers for maximum benefit. “Of course, when he’s speaking to me he’ll say everything he knows I want to hear, and if he’s speaking to the Russians he’ll say everything they want to hear,” said a western diplomat about the president of the country in which he is based. But across the region, growing populations remain in poverty, and the Russian economic crisis of the past two years has put a huge dent in remittances. Standards of healthcare and education show little sign of improving, and the systems are too stubborn and entrenched to allow for real reform. “Even in the best case scenario, central Asia has very problematic and difficult times ahead. The economics are not working any more,” said Mullojanov, the   analyst. Seventy years of Soviet rule followed by a quarter century of autocracy have beaten out the impulse to protest from most central Asians. When revolt has erupted, it has either led to new governments following the status quo, as in Kyrgyzstan, or to violent, ruthless crackdown, as in Uzbekistan’s Andijan in 2005. Even moderate criticism can lead to jail sentences or worse.  In   Jumabayev chose his words carefully, but said the direction of movement was clear: “If a civilisational form doesn’t carry out its obligations to the people, then other forms of civilisation will inevitably develop. We saw it happen with communism, which was overtaken by democracy. Now, we are seeing the same thing happen to democracy. ”

Drink: my resolution for 2017? Try things I haven’t had before
It always surprises me how different most people’s approach to wine is from their approach to food. While we have an apparently insatiable appetite for new ingredients and recipes, there seems to be much less curiosity around booze. If I were talking to you about how to become a better cook in 2017, I’d suggest making a commitment to try at least one new recipe a month, so why not make it a goal regularly to try a drink you haven’t had before? It’s easy to fall into the habit of thinking you don’t like certain drinks, such as beer or whisky, when it’s probably more a question of not having found one you like. If you’re a whisky sceptic, say, why not try a younger, fruitier kind that has none of the peaty notes that are characteristic of many bottles of Scotch? I don’t know if I’m being unduly fanciful here, but I definitely picked up mango in Rampur Select (£40. 95 The Whisky Exchange 43% abv) a new   whisky from India, as well as a touch of apricot and dried apple. It would work beautifully (well diluted) with a good chicken curry. Put aside your prejudices about packaging, too. Many interesting beers, and even wines, now come in cans. I was very taken with the refreshing,   white wine Quello (£15 for six cans 11% abv) I tried from a stall run by Bristol retailer More Wine recently. And I think Aldi is on the right track for younger drinkers with its new “craft wines” which are bottled in squat,   bottles with brightly coloured labels, even though there’s room for improvement with the contents. If you’ve a sweet tooth, I hazard that you’ll enjoy the No Monkey Business White Moskato (£2. 49 for 50cl 5. 5% abv) which I’d serve  . So far as wine is concerned, the fact that you haven’t heard of something is in my book good reason to order it from a wine list or as part of a mixed case. German reds, for example, such as the vibrantly fruity Aldinger Lemberger 2015 (£11. 95 The Wine Society 13% abv) are relatively undiscovered gems. (For the geeks, lemberger is the same grape variety as Austria’s blaufränkisch.) My own resolution is to get better acquainted in 2017 with three drinks that have already been on my radar: sake, kombucha and   tea. You could start with the fragrant Chiyomusubi Oyaji Gokuraku Junmai Ginjo Cup Sake (£8. 95 souschefdirect. co. uk 16% abv) which I found was an unexpectedly good partner for a plate of emmental cheese (which will please my   editor). And it’s sold in a jar. Now how   is that? matchingfoodandwine. com, • Fiona Beckett’s new ebook, 101 Ways To Enjoy Cheese And Wine, is out now at £4. 50.

The reality of being black in today’s Britain
When I was a child, growing up on a council estate in the northeast of England, I imbibed enough of the background racial tensions of the late 1970s and 1980s to feel profoundly unwelcome in Britain. My right, not just to regard myself as a British citizen, but even to be in Britain, seemed contested. Despite our mother’s careful protection, the tenor of our times seeped through the concrete walls into our home and into my mind and into my siblings’ minds. Secretly, I harboured fears that as part of the group identified by chanting   hostile neighbours and even television comedians as “them” we might be sent “back”. This, in our case, presumably meant “back” to Nigeria, a country of which I had only infant memories and a land upon which my youngest siblings had never set foot. To thousands of younger black and   Britons who, thankfully, cannot remember those decades, the racism of the 1970s and 1980s and the insecurities it bred in the minds of black people are difficult to imagine or relate to. But they are powerful memories for my generation. I was eight years old when the BBC finally cancelled The Black and White Minstrel Show. I have memories of my mother rushing across our living room to change television channels (in the days before remote controls) to avoid her   children being confronted by grotesque caricatures of themselves on   television. I was 17 when the last of the touring blackface minstrel shows finally disappeared, having clung on for a decade performing in fading ballrooms on the decaying piers of Britain’s seaside towns. I grew up in a Britain in which there were pictures of golliwogs on jam jars and golliwog dolls alongside the teddy bears in the toy shop windows. One of the worst moments of my unhappy schooling was when, during the   to a 1970s Christmas, we were allowed to bring in our favourite toys. The girl who innocently brought her golliwog doll into our classroom plunged me into a day of humiliation and pain that I still find painful to recall, decades later. When, in recent years, I have been assured that such dolls, and the words “golliwog” and “wog” are in fact harmless and that opposition to them is a symptom of rampant political correctness, I recall another incident. It is difficult to regard a word as benign when it has been scrawled on to a note, wrapped around a brick and thrown through one’s   window in the dead of night, as happened to my family when I was 14. That scribbled note reiterated the demand that me and my siblings be sent “back”. In the early 21st century, politicians in Whitehall and researchers in thinktanks fret about the failures of   communities to properly integrate into British society. In my childhood, the resistance seemed, to me at least, to come from the opposite direction. Many   people felt that while it was possible to be in Britain it was much harder to be of Britain. They felt marked out and unwanted whenever they left the confines of family or community. It was a place and a time in which “black” meant “other” and “black” was unquestionably the opposite of “British”. The phrase “black British” with which we are so familiar today, was little heard in those years. In the minds of some it spoke of an impossible duality. In the face of such hostility, many black British people, and their white and   family members, slipped into a siege mentality, a state of mind from which it has been difficult to entirely escape. What drove us deeper into that citadel of   and watchful mistrust was not just racial prejudice but a wave of racial violence. Throughout those embattled years, my mother, somehow, managed to maintain within our family a regime of   and  . It was this internal, familial microculture that slowly drew me to read history. I stumbled upon the subject that was to become my vocation out of a simple love of story and because of a   fascination with the Second World War that was almost obligatory among boys of that period, whatever their racial background. Britain in the 1980s was a nation still saturated in the culture and paraphernalia of that conflict. For the white   community that I grew up in, the war was the most exciting and significant event ever to collide with our terraced streets and decaying factories. It had changed the lives of my white grandparents, whom I loved deeply, and I was intoxicated by the thought that German bombers had prowled the skies above my home town and that my grandfather had scanned those skies while on watch on the roof of the Vickers Armstrong factory by the Tyne, where he worked building tanks. I wandered into history looking for excitement. I never expected that there I would encounter black and brown people who were like me and my family. I was alerted to those stories of presence and participation by my white mother and I stumbled across more and more stories of black British people as my interests took me further back, into the 19th and then the 18th century. In 1986, I came across the book Staying Power by the British journalist Peter Fryer. It was, I believe, the first book I ever bought for myself. This history of the black presence in Britain was published in 1984, the year in which my family had been besieged in our home, and it set the racism that had so deeply affected our lives within a historical context. It allowed me to understand my own experiences as part of a longer story and to appreciate that in an age when black men were dying on the floors of police cells, my own encounters with British racism had been relatively mild. For me and for thousands of black and white people who read Fryer’s book, its effect was transformative. Fryer took his readers back through the centuries and introduced us to an enormous pantheon of black historical characters, about whom we had previously known nothing. Those black Britons have been with me ever since. I have visited their graves and read their letters and memoirs. They have become part of British history and in some cases part of the national curriculum. Staying Power remains a uniquely important book and anyone who has ever written about black history has found themselves referencing it, quoting from it or seeking out some of the myriad of primary sources it drew together. Fryer’s eloquent chapters offer guidance and provide orientation through a complex and fractured history. Although not the first work of black British history, its impact spread further than most, in part because its publication came at a crucial moment, three years after a wave of riots sparked by hostile policing set ablaze black neighbourhoods of London, Bristol and Liverpool. There was a terrible symmetry to the fact that the most serious and sustained of the early 1980s riots took place in the cities from which the   had set sail in the 17th and 18th centuries. Cities that had been enriched by the slave trade and the sugar business saw fires set and barricades erected by young people who were the distant descendants of those “human cargos”. Not far from the flickering flames of the Bristol riots, a statue of Edward Colston, a slave trader and member of the Royal African Company in the 17th century, looked on as the police were driven out of the black St Pauls district. The riots of the early 1980s were profoundly different from the disturbances of 1919, 1948 and 1958, all of which were at various times described as “race riots” but were mostly outbursts of violence in which white gangs targeted black people and communities. This was not the case in the 1980s. These riots have been called “uprisings”. They were fought by young black people in response to years of systematic persecution and prejudice. They were destructive and damaging but they were understandable. While it is clear today that the riots marked the beginning of the end of one chapter, the nature of the new age that followed remains to be seen. The 1990s and the 2000s were, in many ways, better days. Survey after survey plotted the decline of racist sentiment as a younger generation emerged who had not experienced the racism of the postwar period nor been brought up to view the world in racial terms. Yet this period was the era in which the name of Stephen Lawrence was added to the long list of black Britons who have been murdered by racists. Historians tend to be cautious when it comes to commentating on the modern age, the period through which we are currently living. For me, the period from the 1980s onwards is the one I know from personal memory as well as through historical study, which probably clouds more than it clarifies judgment. But I strongly recall that in the 1980s there was a strong sense among black people of being under siege and of feeling the need to fight for a place and a future in the country. One of the ways in which black people, and their white allies, attempted to secure that future was by reclaiming their lost past. The uncovering of black British history was so important because the present was so contested. Black history became critical to the generation whom Enoch Powell could not bring himself to see as British. A history was needed to demonstrate to all that black British children, born of immigrant parents, were part of a longer story that stretched back to the   whose remains are only now being properly identified. It was in the 1980s that the concept of Black History Month was brought to Britain, an idea that had been pioneered in the United States back in the 1920s, as “Negro History Week”. Black History Month was needed in Britain because the black past had been largely buried and it was during the 1980s that the task of exhumation took on real urgency. Unusually, history became critical to a whole community, while at the same time becoming highly personal to those who discovered it. To look at the portrait of Olaudah Equiano for the first time, and stare into the eyes of a black Georgian, was, for me, as for many thousands of black Britons, a profound experience. To see Equiano, with his cravat and scarlet coat, was to feel the embrace of the past and of a deeper belonging. The black British history that was written in the 1980s was built on the foundations of earlier scholars such as James Walvin and was expanded by hundreds of committed volunteers local historians, community historians and brilliant, determined, sometimes obsessive amateurs. Most worked and still work outside of academia, producing local history or uncovering the presence of black people in parts of the British story from which they have been expunged  —   the world wars, the history of seafaring, the world of entertainment and many others. It is hard to believe that without the recent decades of black history research and writing, the nation, in 2007, would have committed £20m to commemorate the bicentenary of the abolition of the slave trade. A sum that matched, by chance, the price the nation had paid the slave owners in compensation for the loss of their human property in 1838. The next step, I contend, is to expand the horizon and reimagine black British history as not just a story that took place in Britain, and not just as the story of settlement, although it matters enormously. From the 16th century onwards, Britain exploded like a supernova, radiating its power and influence across the world. Black people were placed at the centre of that revolution. Our history is global, transnational, triangular and much of it is still to be written. The opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics, a vast, globally televised pageant that celebrated the British national story, which revelled in the nation’s diversity, music and pop culture, included a   miniature Empire Windrush. This replica was made of a metal frame around which had been stretched fabric printed with the covers of hundreds of postwar British newspapers. She appeared in the Olympic stadium as one among a series of symbolic representations of the pivotal events in British history: the Industrial Revolution, the First World War, the campaigns of the suffragettes, the Jarrow march of 1936 and the creation of the NHS in 1948, the year the Windrush docked at Tilbury. Britain’s black population today stands at around two million, a little more than 3% of the national total. There had been, at most, a few thousand black Londoners in 1948. The history symbolised by the Windrush has become a part of the British story, in a way that no one who attended the 1948 Olympic Games could have possibly imagined. The Empire Windrush has entered the folklore and vocabulary of the nation. There is a Windrush Square in Brixton, a heritage plaque in Tilbury marks the spot where the ship docked and the West Indian migrants came ashore, and a musical based on the lives and ambitions of the Windrush migrants enjoyed a successful run in London’s West End. But this triumph of remembering has come at a cost. The symbolic power of the Windrush moment has at times obscured the deeper and longer black history. As well as losing sight of the more distant past, our focus on the postwar story has meant that, at times, we have been slow to recognise more recent changes. Since the start of the 1980s, Britain has undergone a second great wave of black migration, one that has largely gone unnoticed. This new influx lacked a single iconic moment, comparable to the docking of the Windrush in 1948, and it took place in the far less romantic settings of Gatwick and Heathrow airports, but it was in those great hubs of modern air travel that thousands of Africans arrived, despite ever stricter immigration laws. At the turn of the century, West Indians still made up the majority of the UK’s black population. But, as the 2011 census revealed, between 2001 and 2011, the British African population doubled, through both migration and natural increase. For the first time, probably, since the age of the Atlantic slave trade, the majority of black Britons or their parents have come to this country directly from Africa, rather than from somewhere in the Americas. The migrants from West Africa were mostly Nigerians and Ghanaians and tended to be a little wealthier than the West Indians who had come before them, but were certainly not wealthy by global standards. Some came initially to study but ended up staying. Others migrated to join family and set up home or to take up employment in a Britain that was still hungry for skilled workers. Many of those who arrived from Somalia, Zimbabwe and Sudan came as refugees. The long queues at Britain’s airports of British Africans travelling to Accra, Freetown or Lagos to attend family reunions, weddings or funerals speak to the strengths of the new connections between Britain and Africa. The great postwar project to build an   multiracial Commonwealth with London at its heart, a community of willing nations led by statesmen and businessmen, has, in a sense, been overtaken by globalisation and unprecedented levels of world migration. In a form that the politicians of the 1940s did not envisage, London remains at the centre of the former empire. The capital has become a node in a vast global network of family connections, remittances, investment and mobility. Despite the questionable attractions of nearer Dubai, millions of Africans still feel powerfully drawn to London. While the British African population expands, the West Indian population, longer established and more fully integrated, has amalgamated and assimilated more successfully than perhaps any other immigrant group of modern times. The remarkable capacity of West Indian immigrant families to assimilate can be seen in the marriage statistics. Fewer than half of British West Indians have partners who are also West Indian. According to the Economist, “a child under 10 who has a Caribbean parent is more than twice as likely as not to have a white parent”. While West Indians have drawn millions of white British people into their family networks, they and the African migrants have drawn the whole nation towards their cultures and music. Through sports, music, cinema, fashion and (only latterly) television, black Britons have become the standard bearers of a new cultural and national identity, the globalised hybrid version of Britishness that was so successfully and confidently expressed in 2012. These successes and achievements have been remarkable and in many ways unexpected. The problem is that these good news stories can at times become window dressing and inspire wishful thinking. The reality is that disadvantages are still entrenched and discrimination remains rife. A report by the Equality and Human Rights Commission published in August showed that black graduates in Britain were paid an average 23. 1% less than similarly qualified white workers. It revealed that since 2010 there had been a 49% increase in the number of ethnic minority   to    who were   unemployed, while in the same period there had been a fall of 2% in   unemployment among white people in the same age category. Black workers are also more than twice as likely to be in insecure forms of employment such as temporary contracts or working for an agency. Black people are far more often the victims of crime. “You are more than twice as likely to be murdered if you are black in England and Wales,” said the report, starkly. When accused of crimes, black people are three times more likely to be prosecuted and sentenced than white people. When, as a young man, I began to study history I came to see it as a way to understand the forces that had brought my parents together, shaping my own experiences. Like millions of others, I am a product of Britain’s long involvement with Africa: a history of slave trading and colonisation, but also of traders, missionaries and the Saro people who, having been liberated from slave ships by the Royal Navy, returned to Nigeria from Sierra Leone, bringing to Lagos  —   the city of my birth  —   their Anglican faith and their hybrid   identity. My parents were able to meet in the Britain of the 1960s due to links that had been established in the late 19th century between communities, schools and churches in Lagos, Sierra Leone and other parts of West Africa and universities in the north of England. The racist attacks that, two decades later, led to me and my family being driven from our home by thugs inspired by the National Front were a feature of another inescapable aspect of that same history  —   the development and spread of British racism. The walls of disadvantage that today block the paths of young black Britons are a mutated product of the same racism. Knowing this history better, understanding the forces it has unleashed, and seeing oneself as part of a longer story, is one of the ways in which we can keep trying to move forward.

Hillary Clinton poised to win popular vote despite losing presidential race
If current projections hold, Hillary Clinton will soon become the second presidential nominee to win the popular vote yet lose the electoral college  —   and thus the White House  —   in the past five US presidential elections. Clinton, who gave a speech on Wednesday conceding to her victorious Republican opponent Donald Trump, is poised to lose the electoral college tally by a decisive 74 votes (nearly 14% of the total available) while carrying a slim majority of the overall votes cast. As of Wednesday afternoon Clinton led by more than 200, 000 votes, with 47. 7% to Trump’s 47. 5%. It would be the fifth time in the nation’s history that such a split has occurred and may be a boon to advocates of reform of the    system. “We’re hoping that this will bring further attention when we start lobbying state legislatures next term,” said John Koza, a professor and author who originated legislation to replace the system that is now on the books in 11 states and could eventually bring down the electoral college.  The electoral college is a constitutional relic of a fundamentally different nation, one with 13 states and a potential electorate of 2. 5 million citizens, slashed dramatically by restrictions that limited the franchise to white,   Protestant men. A variety of arguments have been raised for its value, but typically it is understood by political science and history scholars as a constitutional firewall from certain kinds of potentially “undemocratic” election outcomes. One commonly cited scenario is to prevent a   candidate who is highly popular in one relatively small region from racking up impressive margins in a handful of states while more mainstream candidates split votes in a wider array of states. A practical example of this would be a segregationist candidate steamrolling the south during the civil rights era, while a Democrat and a Republican split the rest of the country. But the institution has long been seen by most as a vestigial remnant of a bygone era. In public opinion polls, Americans of all political affiliations resoundingly support a direct presidential election. Trump himself leveled a critique in 2012 when Barack Obama won   in the popular and electoral vote handily. In 2000, George W Bush defeated Al Gore on a   margin of five electoral votes while losing the popular vote by more than a half million votes. While the outcome did prompt conversations about the fairness and usefulness of the electoral college, the historic recount, and peculiar issues surrounding “hanging chads” and “butterfly ballots” tempered that somewhat. But in 2016, the scenario looks different. Trump’s commanding electoral college lead and his unprecedentedly high unfavorable ratings in opinion polls both add dramatically to the dissonance of the outcome.  However, congressional efforts to retire the electoral college have not gained serious traction since a 1934 Senate vote to switch to a direct election failed by just two votes. The arguments then were not dissimilar to the ones advocates offer now. Senator Diane Feinstein of California has tried to build support for a direct election several times over her past three terms, arguing in 2007 that “every vote should be treated equally regardless of the state in which it is cast”. Regardless, there has been no open floor debate on this issue since 1979. One potential workaround that has been proposed is Koza’s   national popular vote legislation. Instead of pushing for a constitutional amendment, which would require   of Congress to sign on, campaign organizers seek to convince state legislatures to pledge their state’s delegates to the winner of the national popular vote. The new method would only become effective once enough states (270 electoral votes’ worth) sign on. Koza’s campaign would not technically abolish the electoral college, but it would ensure that the candidate with the most votes was named the winner of presidential elections. The national popular vote would also end the intense focus on swing states such as Florida and Ohio that frequently change hands and that have characterized the modern US presidential election for decades. Some critics argue that without such battlegrounds, candidates would ignore rural Americans to focus attention on urban centers with high densities of voters.  National popular vote advocates counter that, under the current system, only about 12 battleground states ever get any attention anyway. Right now, the states that have enacted national popular vote bills represent 165 electoral college votes, largely thanks to California with its mammoth 55 votes. All 11  —   including Illinois, New Jersey and Washington  —   are considered safe Democratic states. Koza said that was less a function of how partisan the idea is and more a reflection of where the country was when the campaign was launched. “When we started in 2007, GWB was president so it was viewed Democratically,” Koza said. He said that in recent years, the initiative had received more bipartisan support, passing in the   Oklahoma and Arizona state houses of representatives but failing in both state senates. In addition to the 165 votes worth of states that have enacted the national popular vote, states representing another 97 votes have passed the legislation in one of their two state legislative bodies. If all those states were to adopt the national popular vote in coming years as well, that would bring the project to 262 votes, just eight shy of the threshold to functionally end the electoral college. But that might be a shakier proposition following Trump’s victory than it was before. The fact the electoral college delivered two of the last five elections to GOP candidates who lost the popular vote gives Republican lawmakers little incentive to act.

US declares state of emergency in Puerto Rico over Zika epidemic
The US government on Friday declared a public health emergency in Puerto Rico as a result of a Zika epidemic. The declaration allows the US Department of Health and Human Services to award grants, access emergency funds and temporarily appoint personnel where needed, among other things. “This administration is committed to meeting the Zika outbreak in Puerto Rico with the necessary urgency,” Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a department statement. Burwell traveled to the US territory in late April to evaluate its response to the outbreak. A department spokesman did not immediately return a message seeking comment on what immediate steps the agency may take. The announcement came hours after Puerto Rico reported 1, 914 new cases in the past week, for a total of 10, 690 since the first one was reported in December. The   virus has infected 1, 035 pregnant women, which is a concern to authorities because Zika has been tied to a severe birth defect known as microcephaly. More than 100 pregnant women infected with Zika in Puerto Rico who have given birth have had healthy babies, officials said. Puerto Rico reported the first case of microcephaly acquired on US soil in May, involving a dead fetus that a woman turned over to health authorities. No microcephaly cases have been reported since then, but federal officials say it’s only a matter of time. Governor Alejandro García Padilla said he had asked federal officials to declare a public health emergency and thanked them for their support. “Zika poses a hidden threat to future generations of Puerto Ricans, and I feel the responsibility to do everything in my power to fight the spread of it,” he said. García recently authorized the use of Bti, an organic larvicide, to fight the spread of Zika after rejecting aerial spraying with the insecticide naled as proposed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Puerto Rico Health Secretary Ana Rius said 90 people have been hospitalized because of Zika. Officials also say 30 people have been diagnosed with a temporary paralysis condition known as   that has been linked to Zika. Health authorities say they believe the number of Zika cases is much higher because eight of 10 people show no symptoms and many don’t go to the doctor. The emergency was declared one day after the US surgeon general visited Puerto Rico and said he expected 25% of Puerto Rico’s nearly 3. 5 million people will be infected with Zika by year’s end.

Mexican drug leader’s mother kidnapped by vigilante group
In one of the stranger chapters of Mexico’s drug war, angry people in a southern town have kidnapped the mother of a gang leader to demand the release of their loved ones. The government of Guerrero state said Tuesday that it was sending about 220 soldiers and police to try to defuse the situation in Totolapan. The town has been controlled for years by a drug gang boss whose proper name is Raybel Jacobo de Almonte, but who is better known as “El Tequilero”. De Alamonte has lived up to his nickname, which translates roughly as “the Tequila Drinker”. In his only known public appearance, he was captured on video drinking with the town’s  . De Alamonte mumbles inaudibly and has to be held up in a sitting position by one of his henchmen. In recent months, his gang  —   also known as the Tequileros  —   has been fighting turf battles with other gangs in the area. Last week, the Tequileros allegedly kidnapped several inhabitants of Totolapan who they wanted to extort or whom they suspected of supporting a rival. In response, a few dozen men appeared this week in the streets of Totolapan waving shotguns and hunting rifles. In a video, the men carry banners calling for action against El Tequilero and identify themselves as a “ ” force, as vigilantes are known in the region. “We urgently demand the release of the kidnap victims,” a masked man says in a statement read on the video. “We are a legitimate   force of the people. ” Among the Tequileros’ kidnap victims was a local construction engineer, Isauro de Paz Duque, who was snatched on Sunday by men who had threatened to kill him. On Monday, a woman who identified herself as de Paz Duque’s wife said on a video that townspeople had El Tequilero’s mother and would exchange the woman for her husband. “We have your mother here, Mr Tequilero,” she said. “I propose an exchange: I’ll give you your mother if you give me my husband, but I want him safe and sound. ” The state government said in a statement that a negotiating team had been sent to establish contact with the family of the missing engineer and the vigilantes and to set up a search team. “The goal of the team is to ensure that no injury is done to the missing person, nor to the mother of the head of the Tequileros gang, who has apparently been taken by the   forces,” the statement said. The government later confirmed that about five of the two dozen people being held by the vigilantes had been freed, but those freed did not include the gang boss’ mother. In late November, the Guerrero government said El Tequilero was believed to have been wounded and was hiding out with his kidnap victims in the mountains. The state attorney general headed an extensive manhunt using helicopters and troops on the ground in an unsuccessful effort to locate the gang leader. The area is a hotbed of drug trafficking, killings and extortion. It is the foot of the mountains that produce much of Mexico’s opium poppy crop. Totolapan is considered so dangerous that many outlying hamlets in the township have been abandoned by fearful residents. In 2014, the battered body of the parish priest, the Rev Ascension Acuna Osorio, was found floating in the Balsas river near the town. The emergence of vigilante groups, also known as   “community police” has become a headache for Guerrero’s government. Authorities say they understand residents’ frustration but note the groups often wind up kidnapping suspects, fighting among themselves or preventing police from doing their work. “The truth is, they are not really community forces, nor are they police,” Governor Hector Astudillo said. “They are armed groups that unfortunately carry out acts . .. that generate more violence and confrontation, rather than help. ”

Portugal find a solution to their attacking conundrum: forget the centre-forward
Reducing a European Championship   to a clash between two individuals seems somehow simplistic yet this tactical battle essentially revolved around how Wales and Portugal used Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo. Bale was regularly involved in play but Ronaldo proved decisive. On a wider level this was a clash between two teams playing without a traditional   and instead using two natural wingers up front. Hal   and Nani are more accustomed to wide positions but have been outstanding as strike partners for Bale and Ronaldo respectively. Therefore, this was an unusual test for both defences, who theoretically were not battling against sturdy penalty box prowlers but instead were forced to make decisions about how far to track dangerous runs from mobile, speedy attackers drifting across the pitch. For James Collins and Bruno Alves, both immobile, physical   making their first start of the tournament, it was a particular challenge. Bale plays as a No10 in Chris Coleman’s     system, starting behind   but allowed freedom of movement to drift around. Portugal started defensively here and Wales struggled to play penetrative passes into Bale’s feet, so he wandered into much deeper positions, sometimes popping up at left   sometimes collecting short passes into feet from the  . What Bale really wanted, however, was an opportunity to peel away into the channels. Midway through the first half, having started quietly, he suddenly burst into life. When the Portugal   Cédric Soares was dragged up the pitch to close down the Wales    Neil Taylor, Bale instinctively exploited the space before firing a low   cross into the box. Moments later he was dribbling down the opposite flank, tracked by  —   of all people  —   Ronaldo. Then came Bale’s chance to counterattack. Receiving a short ball into his feet in his own   zone, Bale waited for the challenge of Danilo, Portugal’s sole holding midfielder, before majestically turning past him, driving 70 yards with the ball, before hitting a fairly tame   shot at Rui Patrício. Ronaldo simply was not offered that counterattacking threat. Ronaldo, aside from that surprising moment when he was challenging Bale on the edge of his own box, was much less mobile. Ashley Williams halted his first attempt to run at the Wales defence with a strong early tackle, and from then Portugal’s captain was primarily involved when trying to get on the end of crosses. Coleman would have worried Ronaldo and Nani would use their pace in wide areas to exploit the space on the outside of Wales’s back three  —   instead, they played centrally and Wales coped well. Collins outmuscled Ronaldo to reach a   Soares cross, with Portugal appealing for a penalty, while towards the end of the opening period Adrien Silva created a headed chance for him with a cross from the left. But Portugal’s narrow midfield, with Silva, Renato Sanches and João Mário all playing in a similar zone, meant Portugal were not working combinations down the flanks, meaning they were unable to cross from advanced positions. The crosses were floated, hopeful deliveries from deep. The obvious opportunity to cross from an advanced position, though, was from corners. Five minutes into the second half João Mário rolled a   corner back to Raphaël Guerreiro, whose whipped,   cross found Ronaldo towering over James Chester to head home. Wales had looked so secure defending crosses in open play, yet conceded when able to get themselves organised at a set piece. Portugal doubled their lead with a fortunate goal, Ronaldo’s scuffed shot being diverted into the net by Nani. It hardly owed much to design, yet it was further evidence of Nani’s ability up front: this was his third goal of the tournament. Over the past decade Portugal have regularly turned up for major tournaments with   wingers but no prolific   and suffered from poor finishing at this stage. Here, with Ronaldo heading home and Nani playing poacher, Fernando Santos has found the answer to Portugal’s   problem up front  —   simply do not bother with a  . Coleman and Wales, meanwhile, have overachieved by doing exactly the same.

Former Wells Fargo workers file $2.6bn class action lawsuit amid quota scandal
Two former Wells Fargo employees have filed a class action in California seeking $2. 6bn or more for workers who tried to meet aggressive sales quotas without engaging in fraud and were later demoted, forced to resign or fired. The lawsuit on behalf of people who worked for Wells Fargo in California over the past 10 years, including current employees, focuses on those who followed the rules and were penalized for not meeting sales quotas. “Wells Fargo fired or demoted employees who failed to meet unrealistic quotas while at the same time providing promotions to employees who met these quotas by opening fraudulent accounts,” said the lawsuit, which was filed on Thursday in California superior court in Los Angeles County.  Wells Fargo has fired some 5, 300 employees for opening as many as 2m accounts in customers’ names without authorization from those customers. On 8 September, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and a Los Angeles prosecutor announced a $185m settlement with the bank.  The revelations are a severe hit to Wells Fargo’s reputation. During the financial crisis, the bank trumpeted being conservative in contrast with its rivals. A Wells Fargo spokesman on Saturday declined to comment on the lawsuit.  The lawsuit accuses Wells Fargo of wrongful termination, unlawful business practices and failure to pay wages, overtime and penalties under California law.  Former employees Alexander Polonsky and Brian Zaghi allege Wells Fargo managers pressed workers to meet quotas of 10 accounts per day, required progress reports several times daily and reprimanded workers who fell short.  Polonsky and Zaghi filed applications matching customer requests and were counselled, demoted and later terminated, the lawsuit says.  While executives at the top benefited from the activity, the blame landed on thousands of $   employees who tried to meet the quotas and were often required to work off the clock to do so, the lawsuit said.  Employees with a conscience who tried to meet quotas without engaging in fraud were the biggest victims, losing wages and benefits and facing anxiety, humiliation and embarrassment, the lawsuit said.  Wells Fargo was aware many accounts were illegally opened, unwanted, carried a zero balance, or were simply a result of unethical business practices, the lawsuit said.  “Wells Fargo knew that their unreasonable quotas were driving these unethical behaviors that were used to fraudulently increase their stock price and benefit the CEO at the expense of the low level employees,” the lawsuit said.

Kicking the habit: two former nuns married in civil ceremony in Italy
Federica and Isabel’s love story was not that unusual, apart from one detail. The affair, which culminated in a civil union this week in the Italian town of Pinerolo, began “slowly” according to their friend, Franco Barbero. The two had a lot in common, having both decided to devote their lives to charitable work. They fell in love working at a rehabilitation centre for drug addicts, but there was just one hitch. Both were already married to the Catholic church. Federica and Isabel were Franciscan nuns when they met and fell in love, and have both since renounced their vocation and spoken out against the church’s position against homosexuality. “God wants people happy, to live the love in the light of the sun,” Isabel recently told La Stampa, the Italian daily newspaper. The two brides said that they have not lost their faith and would not otherwise have wanted to leave the church. “We call upon our church to welcome all people who love each other,” added Federica, her new bride. The courtship and civil union comes about one year after a Vatican official, Krzysztof Charamsa, publicly abandoned the church after announcing that he was gay and in love. Charamsa was sacked and defrocked after admitting he was in love with another man. The two women were joined in a civil union in a ceremony behind closed doors in Pinerolo’s city hall, about 24 hours before they had planned. The ceremony was supposed to take place on Thursday, but the time was changed after the media were alerted to the story and the couple wanted to avoid a media frenzy. Luca Salvai, the Five Star Movement mayor who performed the ceremony, told La Stampa: “We have guaranteed the right to privacy for this couple, who asked for discretion. ” He added that the couple were expected to remain in Pinerolo, which is near the city of Turin. “Yesterday morning they arrived by themselves, scared by all the clamor, and after the ceremony they left by themselves in silence, one next to the other,” Salvai said. It was the second same sex civil union ceremony performed in the town of Pinerolo since Italy passed legislation to legalise   unions earlier this year. The couple are also due to participate in a religious service by their friend, Barbero, a former priest who was suspended because of his support of gay marriage. “I can assure you that not all [of the other nuns] were against this. They have been criticised, but also understood by some sisters. Just as there are many good priests who do not condemn these kind of choices. I must add, for the record, that it is not the first time that I happen to marry two sisters,” he said.

Rio 2016: Olympic boxing tournament hit by corruption allegations
Senior figures within amateur boxing have warned many bouts, including those to decide medals, could be fixed at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro amid widespread concern about corruption and financial malpractice at the sport’s global governing body, the Guardian can reveal. Horrified senior officials within the sport believe a cabal of officials are able to use their power to manipulate the draw and the judging system to ensure certain boxers will win. One senior figure said there was “no doubt” some of the judges and referees in Rio “will be corrupted”. He alleged a group of referees get together before major championships to decide how to score certain bouts. Almost every recent Olympics has featured controversy. Most infamously, at the 1988 Games in Seoul the home favourite Park   beat the American Roy Jones Jr in a light middleweight contest the judging of which became a byword for scandal. The Romanian former International Boxing Association (AIBA)   Rudel Obreja alleged manipulation of the judges’ draw at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. This week he alleged to the Guardian that he was forced out of the governing body as a result. Before the London 2012 Games, it was alleged by the BBC that Azerbaijan, which loaned $10m to AIBA to underwrite a professional boxing series that has not been repaid, had effectively bought medals. A thorough AIBA investigation by senior officials rejected the allegations. An AIBA spokesman this week told the Guardian: “Since June 2015, AIBA has undertaken major governance changes ensuring the   development of our sport according to the requirements of our business and sport partners and for the benefits of the AIBA worldwide community. ” But the senior officials who have spoken to the Guardian, who wish to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals against them or boxers from their country, have said the alleged corruption has become more sophisticated and more widespread since the London Games. It is alleged corrupt officials, directed to score bouts in a certain way for a variety of reasons, are said to have initially relied on hand or head signals to manipulate judges at the end of each round so they knew from which corner to select the winner. But after being challenged at a number of major championships they are said to have changed their system, no longer relying on signals but meeting before major championships to decide on certain bouts. “This is all being done very quietly,” said one senior source. “Some bouts are so bloody blatant it’s obvious. It sickens me to my stomach. ” A spokesman for AIBA said its mission was “to ensure the organisation of fair and transparent competitions”. He added: “It is not a matter for AIBA to interfere with the decision made by the judges under sporting rules. ” AIBA said there were approximately 300 judges rated three star and above who were used at elite competitions on a regular basis. It said its certification system ensured all referees and judges “have the highest levels of officiating and are in an optimal situation to perform accordingly”. Sources alleged that at major championships the draw commission was also being directed as to which judges should officiate each bout. AIBA says the draw is operated externally by Swiss Timing, their official scoring partner. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Swiss Timing. In some championships, sources claimed that around half of the bouts could be predetermined. One boxing judge who was prepared to go on the record, Ireland’s Seamus Kelly, told the Guardian he had been asked to cheat at the Arab Games in Doha in 2011 by indicating who was winning during the fight. He claimed a fellow judge had confided there were signals used under the new,   “ ” scoring system at the European Championships in Minsk in 2013. Kelly emailed Dr CK Wu, the sometimes controversial AIBA president, in April 2015 to raise the alarm. Dr Wu replied: “AIBA will immediately investigate this case. We are zero tolerance for this kind of cheating judges. ” Kelly heard nothing further and believes he has been sidelined. “It was mental abuse. I wasn’t sleeping at all because of the way they made me feel. It put an X against my name. They were pushing me away,” Kelly said. “People are afraid to speak out because if they are judges they will be sidelined and won’t get to go to the Olympics or other championships. If they are officials, they fear their country’s boxers will be targeted. ” AIBA said Kelly had been sent home from the youth world championships in 2014 for displaying aggressive behaviour towards one of his colleagues. Though he had since apologised, AIBA said due to the gravity of his actions and “personal issues” it was decided he was not fit to officiate. “Mr Kelly’s allegations are baseless and damaging to our sport,” the spokesman said. “His correspondence to us over the last two years has been erratic, bordering on extortion at times, and once he understood he would not reintegrate into AIBA despite numerous emails, he has decided to launch false accusations against our organisation. ” Kelly disputes AIBA’s version of events. Another   source, who said he believed the manipulation was directed from the heart of the AIBA administration, claimed he witnessed scores being manipulated at major championships and says he is desperately concerned about what is likely to happen at the Rio Olympics. Judges who make these claims are said to have been pressured to stay silent, while others are concerned they will be overlooked for championships and the Olympics if they speak out. AIBA responded: “Boxing is a sport which triggers a lot of passion and sometimes people tend to behave as fans and not as boxing experts, which is prejudicial to the reputation of our sport. As for any Olympic Games, the expectations are very high and we can understand the importance of winning a medal. “However, our role is to ensure a fair and transparent competition and that the thousands of spectators and millions of fans enjoy an amazing tournament with 13 great and undisputed gold medallists. We reiterate that, unless tangible proof is put forward, not just rumours, we cannot further comment on these allegations. ” The spokesman for the governing body added: “We will continue to use any means, including legal action, to protect our sport and its RJ [refereeing and judging] community whose integrity is constantly put into question despite their commitment and expertise. The future of AIBA boxing is bright and the organisation will not be deterred by subjective judgments made by discontented parties which do not reflect the AIBA community as a whole. ” Sources alleged scores are being manipulated to reward countries prepared to pay to host AIBA championships. The international governing body has been accused of haemorrhaging cash since accepting a $10m loan from Azerbaijan to underwrite the expansion of WSB and AIBA Professional Boxing, a competition launched in 2014 to give professional boxers a “pathway” to qualify for Rio. In a memo sent by ousted director general Ho Kim in June 2015 to AIBA executive committee members, seen by the Guardian, he underlines its “precarious financial situation” and the “rapidly expanding budget” of Wu’s presidential office in Taipei. He also alleges Wu’s failed 2013 campaign to become the IOC president was covered out of AIBA funds, a claim AIBA denies on behalf of itself and Wu. Of the Azerbaijan loan, Kim called on the executive committee to “properly understand what are Azerbaijan’s expectations as to the repayment of the loan or what other benefits are expected if the loan cannot be repaid”. The AIBA spokesman said it was “in the process” of repaying the Azerbaijan loan but that it could not go into detail because of confidentiality clauses. In a series of articles on the website Fight News, the Bulgarian journalist Ognian Georgiev last month made a series of detailed allegations about apparently suspect officiating at the Olympic qualifiers in the Venezuelan state of Vargas and the way in which judges were allocated to particular bouts. Another senior boxing official claimed to the Guardian: “Simply because it costs so much to run a tournament, some countries are putting their hands out. You could interpret it in that way  —   look at Venezuela. Looking at the evidence, you have to wonder. ” The South American country is believed to have paid around $450, 000 to host the Olympic qualifying tournament from which four of their six boxers who competed qualified for Rio. Critics say countries who have hosted AIBA championships over recent years appear to have a correspondingly high proportion of boxers who qualify for the Games. The AIBA spokesman responded: “The host city of Vargas was selected by a bidding process and a host fee was paid as is usually the case for all sports events organisation across the world. ” “We do not want to comment on rumours,” Wu told Georgiev. “Approximately 60 matches took place during the   Olympic qualification tournament and all participants including the boxers praised the quality and fairness of the event. ” Terry Smith, a Welshman who sits on the AIBA executive committee and is the honorary life chairman of the referees and judges committee, insisted he had not heard any allegations of malpractice. “I haven’t heard anyone speak like this. If it’s the case, the sooner someone alerts the president, the better. He is in the position to do something about it,” he told the Guardian. “I wish they’d confide a little bit internally. I would like them to challenge it where it takes place. It would be more helpful for us. You can be sitting right in the middle of something and not see it go on,” Smith added. “These are the types of rumours we certainly don’t want with the Olympics coming up. With that many contests going on there is bound to be one that becomes controversial, the last thing you want to know is something like this throwing it into doubt. ”

Mail Online sex attack story ’filled with lies’, Swedish woman says
A Swedish woman has accused the Mail Online of falsely representing her as the victim of a sexual assault in an article about sex attacks allegedly perpetrated by “foreign youths” at a music festival. Lisen Andréasson Florman told the Guardian she was shocked to discover herself cast as the victim of an assault, and said she felt “violated” by the Mail Online report. The article had contained extensive quotes from Andréasson Florman describing a sexual attack at the hands of a group of men, who groped her breasts and left her feeling “small and vulnerable”. “No one groped my breasts, despite what the Daily Mail claims in both headline and story. The Daily Mail has published a piece of sensationalistic writing, filled with lies. The newspaper has consciously distorted my quotes, stolen private photos and lied. All in order to confirm a story that serves an agenda that isn’t mine and to tell a story that isn’t true,” she wrote in a Facebook post.  Her quotes came in a piece that began: “Five women say they were raped at Sweden’s biggest music festival  —   on the same weekend as a mob of ‘foreign youths’ sexually assaulted 35 females, one as young as 12 at another concert. ” The online headline, published next to a picture of her, reproduces a quote, stating: “‘I asked them to stop. .. but they grabbed my breasts very roughly’: Second Swedish music festival victim reveals she was groped by a mob of men as police reveal five more women were raped. ” The quotes were reprinted in the Sun and the Daily Star in the context of a number of reports about an upsurge in sexual violence at the hands of foreign men in Sweden. After contacting the Mail Online, the article was amended and her quotes were removed. She has received no apology from the organisation. The misreported quotes remain on the Sun and the Star websites. Andréasson Florman, who is the founder of a charity, Night Shift, which sends volunteers to festivals and nightclubs to work against violence and sexual assault, said in a telephone call to the Guardian that she had been surrounded by a group of men at the Bråvalla festival. She said she felt intimidated by the men, but she was clear that they were protesting at her professional presence at the festival as a campaigner against violence. “They grabbed me and reached for my radio, but they never roughly grabbed my breast,” she said. She said she told the Mail Online journalist that the men who surrounded her were Swedish.  She was interviewed by the Mail Online a few days after the festival, and gave a   interview about sexual harassment at music events. She said she regretted failing to have read previous articles by the Mail Online freelance journalist Ulf Andersson before agreeing to speak to him. She now believes that some of his earlier reporting appeared to “promote an   or xenophobic angle”.  “The attacks on the festival are of great significance politically in Sweden. We are seeing how   politicians are using these incidents to promote   sentiments in our society,” she said, adding that her organisation sees “no connection between the refugee influx or immigrants and the occurrence of sexual harassment or assault in Swedish nightlife”. “We have noticed an apparent increase in organised assaults where several men cooperate in surrounding and groping girls. It’s not  —   contrary to what you hear some people say in the public debate  —   linked to certain ethnicity, background or religion. Not in our experience, and we spend hours and hours in the field. The only common denominator is that the perpetrators we’ve come across are all men. ” A series of articles about attacks by foreign youths at Swedish music festivals has been published by the Mail Online this month. The subject has become highly politicised in Sweden in the wake of the unease about sex assaults in Cologne on New Year’s Eve. After reports of attacks at the Puttei Parken festival, police quickly attributed the crimes to “foreign youths” in a statement on the Värmland regional police website. The statement was later removed after doubt was cast on whether the attackers had been Swedish or from elsewhere. Earlier this year, the Swedish embassy in London was reported to have sent a dispatch to the Swedish foreign ministry expressing concern that the Daily Mail was running a campaign against Sweden’s refugee policy. “The tabloid Daily Mail has launched a campaign against Swedish migration policy,” the message said, according to Swedish media. “Sweden is being used as a deterrent and an argument against allowing more refugees into the UK. ”  The Swedish embassy said they had no comment when contacted. The Mail Online did not respond to a request for comment.  Andréasson Florman said Night Shift was a “  organisation, which takes a clear stand against racism and sexism” and she was angry that her words had been “misused and misrepresented by media outlets and people who seem to have another agenda which is highly political”.  She was also angry that the reports were illustrated with pictures from her Facebook, reproduced without her permission. “Of course I am angry when my organisation’s work and my own person is misrepresented. It does not help the struggle against violence and sexual assault by construing facts for political gain,” she said.

England and penalties: 20 years of hurt that could continue against Iceland
Stefan Kuntz remembers the moment well. He says the Euro 96   between England and Germany at Wembley was the highlight of his career. The   anniversary of the game was on Sunday, and it’s fair to say the repercussions of the result have been   for England than for Germany. The game had finished   and it went to a penalty shootout. Kuntz had asked the coach, Berti Vogts, to put him fifth in the list of   for one specific reason: he was hoping that the shootout would be over by the time it came round to him. Kuntz was only playing because Jürgen Klinsmann had been injured in a     against Croatia. But he had scored Germany’s equaliser against England and had an   header ruled out for a foul. “Never a foul,” he says. As he watched England score all five of their penalties, he became angry. “It was terrible for me. I was fifth because I never wanted to take one, and when it came to it, my penalty was the most important of all. During that walk, you are so alone, so afraid. I had to find a way to conquer my nerves. So I made myself angry. That way, I forgot about the nerves. ” Kuntz thought about his children, who were then five and seven, and how their   would tease them if he missed the penalty. “I got so angry at the thought of these clowns upsetting my kids. I thought: ‘Don’t do this to your family! ’” Kuntz,   hit Germany’s best penalty, high to his natural side. He was so wound up that afterwards he forgot to smile. Just a deep breath as he returned to the  . It was  . Sudden death. Next up was Gareth Southgate, whose weak shot was saved by Andreas Köpke. Andreas Möller scored the winning penalty (even though the Germans had still not decided who would take that penalty until Southgate missed at that point, Möller ran forward before anyone could object). England lost the match. More significantly, it was the moment that England’s psychological issue with penalty shootouts took seed. The trauma of this defeat was far greater than in 1990, when West Germany beat them in the World Cup   on penalties. This time around, England were the home nation, it was Germany, and on penalties, again. The press had been full of military metaphors  —   The Mirror’s “Achtung Surrender!” headline before the game took it too far and as a result, team sponsors Vauxhall pulled their advertising from the paper  —   but once again, England had fallen short. “There was additional pressure because of the meaning of the game, the fact that it was against Germany. We knew that the media had turned this game into a war but for us it was never like that,” Kuntz says. “Look, even our parents were not involved in the war, it was two generations away from us, so we did not understand the headlines. It would have been more helpful for the England team if it was not about war or history, but if they just concentrated on football. I think the media built up this game too much and that added to the pressure for the players. ” It was England’s great misfortune that they had to endure another shootout defeat so soon after, at the 1998 World Cup, against another nation with whom the country had a complicated sporting and political history: Argentina. England lost that one, too. So by the time they faced Portugal in Euro 2004  —   and, surprise, surprise, lost again  —   there was already a   complex about penalty shootouts. Would this complex exist if England had lost to another nation on penalties in 1996? Switzerland, say? Or the Czech Republic? Alex Gordon is a professional semiotician and chief executive of Sign Salad, a cultural insight agency that looks for meaning in everyday events and symbols. “It’s clear to me that international football is the   replacement for battle,” Gordon says. “We see that not just with the language used in football reporting  —   “from the camp” “gaining territory” that kind of thing  —   but also with national anthems and exchanging of pennants before matches. “A penalty shootout is critical to the way a nation views itself. Its whole cultural narrative is being written as it takes place, and the national myth is being reinforced or transformed. In England’s case, it absolutely matters because every loss on penalties is a reminder of our loss of Empire the penalty defeat is about the loss of our global status. ” Gordon also links the clarity and simplicity of the penalty’s    combat, especially in today’s social     landscape, to a romantic appeal that can be traced back to Hector, Lancelot and Robin Hood. “Historically the duel is about chivalry and romance, all of which are true of the penalty,” Gordon says. “There’s the respect of waiting till your opponent is ready the romantic stories of penalty heroes and villains. And masculinity plays a huge role only the brave take a penalty, but missing one is like losing your  . Like the lion who loses a fight and is banished from his pride: this is about the essential structure of the human and animal tribal system. ” England have not won a shootout in the 20 years since that dramatic summer’s night at Wembley. Their last two European Championship knockout matches have ended the same way: with shootout defeats, by Italy (2012) and Portugal (2004). As Roy Hodgson’s team prepare to face Iceland on Monday, and a possible   against France, the spectre of   looms large. Kuntz has some advice, even if it does come 20 years too late: “Sometimes when you’re at home, you can feel the doubt of your own fans. I wonder if Southgate thought: ‘Even the fans don’t think I will score this,’” he said. “What is in your mind is often what will happen, and controlling your mentality is a huge part of the game. ” This is an edited extract from the updated paperback version of Ben Lyttleton’s book Twelve Yards: The Art  Psychology of the Perfect Penalty (Bantam Press)

The Voice: five things we learned from the season 11 preview
After NBC’s coverage of the Olympic closing ceremony from Rio, viewers were treated to an additional heaping helping of musical numbers and awkward commentary thanks to a preview of the upcoming season of the talent search stalwart with those revolving chairs aka The Voice. Revamped for an American   television landscape, the latest iteration features veteran judges Adam Levine and Blake Shelton, along with newcomers Miley Cyrus and Alicia Keys. Here are five takeaways of what we’re in store for this upcoming season. Blatantly fake “tension” between judges has always been a   storyline for producers looking to fill airtime and spur watercolor conversation. Fortunately for new judges Cyrus and Keys, the responsibility of creating “drama” will largely fall on the shoulders of Adam Levine and Blake Shelton. It’s a refreshing break from the “diva” dustups which have been the stock option when it comes to talent shows looking for headline grabbing “fallouts”. While none of the judges are ever Simon Cowell levels of tough, it seems Keys will take the role of a nice, supportive member of the panel, especially considering her reaction on Sunday night to    We McDonald, who delivered a rousing rendition of Nina Simone’s classic Feeling Good. While Levine sat   Keys looked on like a proud mom and jumped out of her seat, which is a classic move from the “nice” judge. When it came time to offer some criticism, Keys called McDonald both “beautiful” and “perfect”. While Cyrus was almost as nice as Keys, one thing that’s apparent is that she’s still going to provide the most   moments. Judging by a denim jacket adorned with monstrously oversized flowers, her clothes might do a lot of the talking but you can still expect moments like when she hopped up on stage as a contestant was getting critiqued to belt out a random acapella version of Dolly Parton’s Jolene. (For her part, Keys followed that up with an equally random acapella performance of her hit, No One.) So tune in if you like acapella  . The television landscape is a much different place from when The Voice premiered in 2011. Back then, viral internet moments were hapless accidents, as opposed to today when they’re both manufactured and something any show seeking relevance desperately needs to survive. (One of the reasons cited as to why Comedy Central’s Nightly Show was axed was a lack of social media interaction.) Luckily, with Keys, Cyrus, Levine and Shelton, The Voice’s new season is bound to be chock full of shareable moments, starting with the preview episode’s epic, outdoor performance of Aerosmith’s Dream On sung by the judges. It was a moment that was instantly passed around Twitter for forensic analysis and universal mocking.  Much like any other reality TV completion series, NBC is well aware that it’s only a matter of time before The Voice loses steam. Sure, American Idol petered out first, but that’s because Idol began a full 10 years before The Voice. Once fighting for its spot in a crowded landscape, the series is now a lone wolf when it comes to major singing competitions, and its clock is ticking as well. That’s part of the reason why executives thought to revamp the proceedings in the first place, though no amount of rearranging will seal its fate as the competition trend continues to fade and future seasons of The Voice roll on.

What makes Novak Djokovic the perfect tennis player – and so hard to beat?
“It’s particularly the backhand return,” says Craig O’Shannessy, the strategy analyst for Wimbledon, the Australian Open and the ATP and WTA Tours. “It’s the best backhand return in the world. That’s where it all starts. Most serves are directed to the backhand. It’s just really the simplicity of his technique. Two hands on the grip, his upper body rotates 90 degrees sideways and that’s it. O’Shannessy points out that Novak Djokovic rarely goes for broke on the return. “The big target area is deep right down the middle of the court. He’s trying to negate the impact of the serve. The server (usually) has an extra two shots off the serve where the serve still has influence, a halo effect. If you’re serving, you never want to hit a fourth shot because then you’re into an even   battle where the serve is irrelevant. Djokovic, with that return, the server is lucky if they get one extra shot. Sometimes they’re actually on defence on the very first ball after the serve. Then he has great court position. It’s huge percentages. Djokovic will hurt you everywhere, he doesn’t hit so many return winners  —   at Wimbledon in 2015 he only hit 11  —   but he gets so many returns back into play. ” “The biggest thing is his ability to hit a spot,” O’Shannessy says. “If I was to put an empty can of balls on the court and you pick one player to hit a spot, typically it would have been Roger Federer. Today, coming into Wimbledon, I think Djokovic is that guy. Particularly the corners. He doesn’t serve a ton into the body but he serves a lot of sliders out wide in the deuce court, the patterns are like Federer, when he needs a point he will serve more out wide in the deuce court when he has a bit of leeway he will go more down the T. In the ad court he mixes things very evenly. He has cleaned up his motion, the toss is ridiculous, it’s in the same spot every time. It’s not the hardest serve  —   in 2015, his average for the tournament was 117mph on first serve, 97 on the second serve and his fastest was 127. He puts a little topspin on it, there’s a little slice on it, in the ad court down the T especially, there’s a little more topspin on the ad out wide just to cover it and improve those percentages a little bit. His first serve percentage is 66. 6% for the last 52 weeks, which puts him third on the Tour only Rafael Nadal and John Isner are higher. “When we think of players, we think of them in terms of styles,” O’Shannessy says. “David Ferrer’s a grinder, Lleyton Hewitt’s a   and Federer’s an all‑court player etc. But every player on the planet is a first‑strike player  —   the points exist in the   shot range. Seventy per cent of all points finish in the first four shots, 20% are in the five to eight shot range and 10% are nine shots plus. Djokovic is right at that average. In the 2015 Australian Open, 69% of all points he played were nought to four 21 were in the five to eight range and only 10% were in nine plus. We think of him playing all these long points and grinding. But again, in the 2015 Australian Open, in the   range, he only won 13 more points than he lost. He was plus 48 in five to eight and he was plus 89 in nought to four. He’s not the animal we think he is. When the points are longer, he runs, he’s elastic and his defence is fine but by far the majority of points he collects are in nought to four because of his ability to hit spots on serve  —   and particularly his amazing points. His advantage is much more in the nought to four than it is in the nine plus. ” Henri Leconte, the former France Davis Cup player, believes Djokovic is as dominant now as Federer and Nadal were in their pomp. “He is the one and only for the moment,” says Leconte, who will be commentating for Eurosport during Wimbledon. “After winning the Davis Cup against France in 2010 he’s definitely found a way to concentrate himself and be ready for the big tournaments and grand slam play, as he is doing now. ” Leconte says Djokovic’s tough upbringing, in   Serbia, played a part in his mental strength. “Definitely, life has been hard and complicated for him and as a family,” Leconte says. “Definitely, I think that he went through a lot of terrible things, so now he can enjoy life. For him, if he wins it’s very important, if he loses it’s not the end of the world. He is happy in his life, he knows his body really well, mentally he can also produce and be more relaxed. When you are winning everything, when you are on top of your game and you’re the No1, you just enjoy yourself, you know what to do. ” “Djokovic’s fitness is the best in the world,” Leconte says. “The way he practises, he has a new technique, he is more flexible than anyone else. Before we used to say you need muscles, you need power it’s not the case any more, you have to be fit, you have to be able to react as well, be light, be flexible, you have to be many things. I haven’t seen anyone as flexible as him  —   maybe Plastic Man. I think the most important thing to be now is to be flexible, to have the ligaments and joints flexible, too. Be capable of training as hard as possible, not losing power and be flexible. When I watch him slide, I just think I would break myself. He is capable of doing it. He is unbelievable. ”

13th review – Ava DuVernay’s angry, persuasive film about the jailing of black men
Ava DuVernay, director of the Martin Luther King drama Selma, has made a fiercely radical documentary for Netflix in sympathy with the Black Lives Matter movement. Her film argues that America’s incarceration of black men is a phenomenon with its roots in slavery, and that the resemblances are not minor or ironic echoes but symptoms of the same structural cause. Ironically, it is about the 13th constitutional amendment, which abolished slavery and the state’s right to deprive a person of liberty but with the specific exception of “criminals” thus forging a link in the judicial mindset between imprisonment and slavery. It is an attitude that persists into the Jim Crow era, the   wars on crime and drugs, the Clinton   rule   …     and beyond. The state’s punitive energies were always targeted at the poorest, the least able to pay bail, the likeliest to be involved in crime and the most liable to have their protest criminalised. It’s like taking the Matrix red pill when you listen to statements from Nixon aide John Ehrlichman and Reagan consigliere Lee Atwater making it clear that attacks on “drugs” and “crime” are euphemisms for race. And with private firms running jails and lobbying Washington, black males have become raw material for a corporate legal industry. An intensely angry and persuasive piece of   though maybe letting Bill and Hillary off the hook, a little bit.

Zsa Zsa Gabor dies aged 99
The actor and celebrity Zsa Zsa Gabor has died aged 99. The Hollywood star, arguably more famous for her larger than life personality and string of marriages than for her films, passed away at her home in Los Angeles on Sunday. Her husband, Frederic von Anhalt, said she died of a heart attack. “We tried everything, but her heart just stopped and that was it,” he said. “Even the ambulance tried very hard to get her back, but there was no way. ” Gabor suffered a series of illnesses in recent years and had to have her leg partially amputated in January due to poor circulation. She suffered a stroke in 2005, three years after a car accident had left her partially paralysed.  In 2010 she reportedly asked a priest to administer the last rites after surgery to remove two blood clots the following year she had a leg amputated. The last stage of her life was reported to have been spent suffering from dementia. This spell of   was said to have begun after she was sent to hospital suffering from grief and anxiety over the death of Elizabeth Taylor in March 2011. Her then publicist John Blanchette (who died in 2014) revealed that Gabor suffered dangerously high blood pressure watching TV coverage of the news of Taylor’s death, saying: “Oh, Jane Russell and Liz Taylor  —   I’m next. ” Although many of the details of her early life are disputed, Gabor is believed to have been born on 6 February 1917 as Sari Gabor in Budapest, Hungary, where she was brought up with her older and younger sisters, Magda and Eva. She acted on stage in Vienna in her youth before emigrating to the United States in 1941. Her first starring role was in Moulin Rouge (1952) directed by John Huston. She attained cult figure status starring in 1950s   including Queen of Outer Space, in which she played a rebel Venusian who falls in love with four Earthmen whom her   queen wants to destroy. Later, she maintained her profile with film and TV cameos. She made one such appearance in The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear (1991) featuring in a scene that appeared to make fun of her   conviction for slapping a police officer in a traffic incident. She appeared in dozens of films, but these achievements were arguably overshadowed later on by public interest in her extravagant style and fondness for wealthy husbands. She married nine times and her spouses included Conrad Hilton, the founder of the Hilton hotel chain, and Barbie doll creator Jack Ryan. Her last marriage was also her longest lasting: she tied the knot with Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt in 1986.  He has also battled   in recent years, hospitalised twice in 2010, once after swallowing a bee and another time following his gluing his eye shut. He was also involved in a motor accident in 2011 . Gabor’s only child, Francesca Hilton, died aged 67 in February 2015. As news of Gabor’s death spread, friends and fans paid tribute to her on Twitter.

Why 2017 won’t be the year women get paid the same as men
All in all 2016 hasn’t been a great year for women’s rights. The small flicker of hope that we might finally have a female president in the US was thoroughly doused by Donald Trump. Last year two women won a Nobel prize this year there was none. The number of female CEOs in the Fortune 500 dropped. And research announced at the World Economic Forum found that it will take approximately 170 years to close the gender pay gap around the world. One hundred and seventy years. So overall it doesn’t look like 2017 is going to be the year women finally achieve gender parity. In fact, so far the attempts to move us toward it have proved to be, well, a bit  .  The UK government’s attempt to make pay gap reporting mandatory for all companies with more than 250 employees has been met with disgruntled muttering and very little action from business.  A few organisations have made some tentative steps towards it, and those already reporting their gender pay gaps should be applauded, but for most it was just another piece of red tape to be ignored. Much easier to point the finger at women and say it’s our fault for not asking. A great deal is made of the need to encourage women to negotiate more effectively. However, even if we take that into 2017, research suggests it’s not going to help. While women ask for pay rises as often as men do, they’re much less likely to get them. The reality is we expect men to be pushy about salary, to ask for more money and to vocalise their worth, so when they do it we’re not surprised. However, society has taught that it’s not polite for women to do the same, so when they do, we tend to see them as pushy and arrogant, and that instantly makes us less likely to reward them. So while it’s useful to encourage women to negotiate their salary more firmly, it’s also not the only way to solve this problem and certainly won’t help women in the coming year. This doesn’t mean equal pay in 2017 is impossible. We might not be able to achieve it on a worldwide level, but within the UK, the US and Australia it should certainly be achievable.  In 2015, Salesforce did an audit of its pay gap. CEO Marc Benioff was so sure the company wouldn’t have a gender pay gap that he made a deal with his senior female employees. If they could prove there was in fact a pay gap he would instantly fix it.  They proved it and Benioff instantly paid out US$3m (£2. $4. 1m) to fix it. He found every woman who was being paid less than a male colleague doing the same job and adjusted her salary accordingly. In the grand scheme of things $3m is not much to a big corporation like Salesforce, but the amount of goodwill it bought was priceless. There’s absolutely nothing stopping other businesses following suit. And this is the one bright light that has come out of 2016. While it hasn’t been a good year for women’s rights, it has been a great year for women speaking up and making their voices heard. From politics to Hollywood, women around the world have been calling time on the sexist attitudes and experiences they’ve encountered and pushed back against them.  If we can keep doing that in 2017 then maybe, just maybe, we’ll be shouting so loudly that no company would dare to underpay us ever again.

How do I tell my daughter that her online ‘truth’ is a conspiracy theory?
I was having a discussion with one of my children  —   I won’t say which one, but let’s just say she is very much a part of the virtual generation  —   those who get most of their entertainment and information from the internet. The subject turned to, well, possibly global warming, ecology or food pollution. The point was, my daughter had some facts. Or thought she had some facts. The gist was that these   facts, which she’d picked up online, were not only enormous and significant, but were being suppressed by the mainstream media. Everyone knew about these facts but were determined to ignore them, because these facts reflected badly on the government. I pointed out to my daughter that I had some little experience of journalism and the news media, and that such a scenario was excessively unlikely. The idea that the whole news media could collectively shut down a story because it was uncomfortable to the government just didn’t make sense  —   not least because of competition, the search for status and the profit motive. Yes, facts could be suppressed because of libel laws and gagging injunctions  —   but not because of a conspiracy among, say, the editors of the Daily Mail, the Guardian and the Today programme. They all had too little in common and too much to gain by breaking a big story. I waited, like a fool, for her to adjust her opinion. None was forthcoming. Quite the opposite. She became angry with me and in effect accused me of thinking I knew everything. Her conviction that there was an international media conspiracy going on to suppress uncomfortable facts was undiminished. Now, this might mean nothing. Or it might mean a great deal. As it happened, the next day I came across an article in the New York Times entitled “How the internet is loosening our grip on the truth”  —   a very timely exposition of the   society. The author suggests that we exist in smaller and smaller “ ” and can choose to follow sources of information that merely mimic our own views. What is happening seems to be a mass case of arrested development. Children can be remarkably gullible but also absolutely impervious to reality. You can tell them that a man comes down the chimney dressed in a red suit to deliver their Christmas presents and they will happily believe you. On the other hand, you can point out that the moon is not, in fact, made of green cheese, and they will call you an outright liar. This confusion about the truth usually begins to disappear as children grow up and see that there are not only observable facts, but also collectively observable knowledge that is difficult to verify but must nevertheless be taken on trust. The idea that the Earth is (roughly) a sphere and orbits the sun is pretty much universally accepted, but very few know the science that proves it. It is taken as a matter of faith as part of our established store of knowledge. It struck me as I argued with my daughter that the collective store of trusted knowledge is dwindling, despite the   information revolution. Adults, like children, tend towards the irrational, and the internet has become an immense tool for facilitating that tendency. I worry for our children, because they live in a world of decaying trust that they seem powerless to resist. As universities become more about servicing paying customers than teaching critical thinking, and all knowledge takes on the aspect of being an optional individual extra chosen from a range of    opinions, we are condemning ourselves to think like children our whole lives. And as William Golding noted in Lord of the Flies, children, left to their own devices, can be very wicked indeed. @timlottwriter

If Berlusconi is like Trump, what can America learn from Italy?
Among the political figures who congratulated Donald Trump on his surprise election victory was the politician to whom the billionaire real estate mogul and reality television star has most often been compared: Silvio Berlusconi. The rightwing former Italian prime minister and billionaire media mogul, who was dogged by claims that he used an underage prostitute at his infamous “bunga bunga” parties and counted Vladimir Putin as a close ally and friend, said the comparisons between the two were “obvious” and that Trump would rule with “authority and equilibrium”.  If it’s true that Berlusconi and Trump, two showmen who have railed against immigrants, mocked women and targeted press freedom, are indeed cut from the same cloth, it may also be the case that few will understand liberal Americans’ consternation in coming years like the Italians.  Here, then, are some warnings  —   and a few words of advice. For years, Berlusconi’s boorish behaviour was a gift to political opponents and journalists who were free to ridicule him. But ultimately they did not prove an effective opposition. “Berlusconi’s opponents had a very wide and open avenue and they couldn’t resist walking down that avenue. This brought them to a number of defeats. Because when he said: ‘The west is [superior]’ and opponents said: ‘How politically incorrect, white imperialist’ the reality is that a huge part of the Italian voters said in private: ‘He is right,” said Giovanni Orsina, author of Berlusconism and Italy, an exploration of how Berlusconi held on to power. Opposing Berlusconi by ridiculing him, Orsina said, was a way to preach to the converted, as were attempts to warn that Berlusconi’s rule represented the end of Italian democracy. “The most powerful way to oppose him, but it was never really done seriously, was to try and understand what his voters want and try to address the need of his voters. No jokes, stop shouting, stop crying, stop saying: ‘It is a horror and disaster’ try and seriously understand what his voters want, and the left was never really successful in doing that,” Orsina said. Trump has made no secret of his disdain for the media, having promised during his campaign to “open up our libel laws” to make it easier to sue media organisations for damages  —   singling out the New York Times, CNN, and the Washington Post, among others  —   and promising: “If I become president, they’re going to have such problems. ” Berlusconi’s rise in Italy was inexorably linked to his control of the media. He not only exerted influence over   organisations through his role as prime minister, but through his own media empire, including a major broadcaster and publishers.  “Many journalists were complicit even without being controlled, for example by accepting conditions, or when he chose journalists he preferred for interviews,” said Jacopo Iacoboni, a political journalist at La Stampa. In what was later called “the Bulgarian edict” Berlusconi in 2002 accused journalists at   RAI of using “television as a criminal means of communication” in part because of reports that alleged Berlusconi had ties with organised crime. The journalists were subsequently fired and banned from working for RAI. Berlusconi was ultimately acquitted of knowingly hiring an underage prostitute at his infamous “bunga bunga” parties, and of abusing his position to cover it up. But his tenure became synonymous with the everyday demeaning of women  —   particularly on television  —   as sex objects, as the prime minister regularly insulted and mocked women in public, even making sex jokes at public events meant to honour women’s achievements.  In Berlusconi’s Italy, a woman’s looks were paramount. The prime minister even appointed a former model and showgirl to serve as equal opportunities minister. Trump’s obsession with women’s looks has similarly been well documented throughout his campaign for president, including his rating women on a scale of   and numerous accusations of sexual harassment and assault. But in Italy there was also a backlash, and an awakening among some Italian women, according to Emma Bonino, the former foreign minister and feminist who helped secure abortion and divorce rights in Italy in the 1970s. “Berlusconi’s attitude prompted a sort of revolt from women, and women’s groups, who had been silent and absent for years, even on important women’s issues,” Bonino said. It prompted opposition to female stereotypes, particularly in the media, and the scourge of domestic violence, which had often gone unacknowledged, she said.  Berlusconi had an unspoken agreement with the Roman Catholic church that helped him hold on to power.  Italian bishops looked the other way and did not criticise what might otherwise have been deemed    behaviour, as long as Berlusconi helped them on their legislative agenda, including blocking   unions, limiting fertility treatments opposed by the church, and generally addressing their fear of being “swallowed up by secularisation, Islam [in the form of immigration] and liberalisation” said Massimo Faggioli, a church historian at Villanova University. Five years after his resignation from office, Italy still has no prospects of passing   marriage into law (though civil unions are now legal) lesbian and gay parents do not have legal rights over their children, IVF treatment is limited to married couples, and surrogacy  —   strongly opposed by the church  —   is illegal. Similarly, the   Trump   who has never convincingly spoken of having religious faith  —   won the support of four out of five white evangelicals, largely based on their hopes that Trump would elect conservative   judges on the supreme court. While it has received scant attention, Trump has also promised to repeal a 1954 ban that prevents   organisations like churches from getting involved in politics, a change that could give churches an even more powerful role in US politics. Last week Trump settled fraud lawsuits relating to Trump University for $25m, removing a legal headache despite having pledged to fight the cases to the bitter end.  He has also alleged that he is the subject of an audit by US tax authorities and, before his election, had threatened to sue women who had accused him of sexual harassment and assault. Berlusconi faced similar entanglements with the judicial system and the issues ultimately pressured him and constrained his ability to pass legislation. Prosecutors who sought to charge him with crimes were derided as unelected communists, and there a poisonous relationship soon developed between judges and prosecutors and the prime minister’s office. “Berlusconi tried to use his political power to defend himself, making laws and using his position as prime minister to delay trials. There were also several legal attempts  —   like making a law that as president of the republic you cannot go to trial as long as you are in power  —   but he never really succeeded,” said Orsina. Trump enters the White House after a contentious election in which he derided federal investigators at the FBI, but also after he was seen as having been helped by the FBI director, James Comey, who made a surprise announcement about the continuation of a probe into Hillary Clinton  —   which was later dropped  —   11 days before the election. Trump has also sought to delay a civil fraud trial into one of his businesses until after his inauguration. Like Trump, Berlusconi’s rise was fuelled by his   views, particularly against the Roma and, later, migrants. In his final years in office, defections from Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party forced him to look to Italy’s far right  —   even more than he had before  —   to keep his coalition, essentially forcing him to lock arms with the xenophobic Northern League, which has called for the expulsion of migrants. A similar dynamic may soon be at work in the US.  While Donald Trump this week called for the deportation of 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants who have allegedly committed crimes, he left the door open to even more deportations later on, even as the Republican speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, who is a mainstream conservative, denied there was interest in a “deportation force”. A rupture between Trump and Ryan could force Trump to seek alliances among even more rightwing Republicans on immigration policy. The position of minorities in Italian society, according to the senator and human rights expert Francesco Palermo, was “affected severely” in large part due to a series of “emergency decrees” that sought to expel the Roma from Italy. Funds for traditional minorities were reduced and are now   of what they were in 2000, Palermo said, and migrants “were scapegoated for the overall decline of society”. “I do not believe minorities will be a direct target under the Trump administration, as this would immediately be under the spotlight. But more worrying, the deterioration of their situation will be a consequence of the societal climate. This is somewhat similar to the trend we observed in Italy under Berlusconi,” Palermo said. Berlusconi did not ultimately vanquish Italy’s democratic institutions. But the lasting damage he inflicted, according to Guy Dinmore, a former correspondent for the Financial Times who covered Berlusconi’s final term, came in the way his   premiership celebrated and normalised the flouting of rules, including on paying taxes. “What he did was to perpetuate the old system he inherited, which was a clientelist system where meritocracy had no place, and corruption is rife, and people were almost encouraged by Berlusconi not to pay their taxes. Italy was a swamp   …     and he made it worse,” Dinmore said. Journalist Iacoboni agreed, saying the lasting impact of Berlusconi was “the cultural idea that you could do anything in your own interests. ”  “He legitimised every kind of infraction of rules, going back to his television career in the 1980s. It was as if to say: ‘You Italians like to be gross with women? Well, I say to you, you can do this.’ I think this [idea you can do anything to further your own interests] is much worse than even the legal accusations. ”

Barbara Gibb, mother of the Bee Gees, dies aged 95
Barbara Gibb, the mother of the three Gibb brothers who became pop band the Bee Gees, has died at the age of 95. Barbara, who was born and raised in Manchester, died of natural causes on Friday evening at her home in Miami, where she had lived for the past 20 years, according to a publicist for her eldest son, Barry Gibb. Her son, Barry, and daughter, Lesley, survive her. The family were living on the Isle of Man when she gave birth to Barry and the twins, Robin and Maurice, who would later go on to form The Bee Gees. She also had another son, Andy, and a daughter, Lesley, with her husband Hugh Gibb, a bandleader for the Hughie Gibb Orchestra in Manchester, whom she married in 1944. The couple managed their sons’ early music career and The Bee Gees became one of the most successful pop bands in history. As a band and through solo projects, the trio sold tens of millions of records. She survived the deaths of three of her five children. Andy, also a successful musician, died in 1988 aged 30 from the heart condition myocarditis. Maurice died unexpectedly in 2003 at the age of 53 due to complications from a twisted intestine, while his twin Robin died in 2012 aged 62 from liver and kidney failure after battling colorectal cancer.

Tiger Woods aims for December comeback ... and Jack Nicklaus’s record
Tiger Woods, beset by injuries and the decline of his playing career, appears to have at least one person who still believes in him. And that person is Tiger Woods. In an interview with Charlie Rose on PBS on Thursday night, the former world No1 said he is targeting an imminent return to golf as well as more victories in the majors. Woods has not played competitively since August 2015 after three separate operations on his back, and pulled out of a planned return earlier this month after describing his game as “vulnerable”. But he told Rose on Thursday that he is “hoping to come back in December”. Rose then asked Woods if he expected to equal Jack Nicklaus’s record total of 18 majors. “No   …     I’ve accepted I’m going to get more,” Woods replied. Woods’s last victory in a major was at the 2008 US Open, the 14th major title of his career. Woods also described his respect for Nicklaus’s achievements. “I looked up to him, I looked at his record. . .. I wouldn’t say I lusted for his record. I just think that was the gold standard because he had won the most majors and the   Tour events. And here he is at 18. ”  Woods also said he missed competing against his fellow professionals. “Do I miss it? Absolutely, 100%. And to be at my age now, at 40 years old   …     I’m the first one to admit: I can’t do the things I used to be able to do. Most people can’t at my age, versus when they were younger. I have to find different ways to go about it. ” At his peak, Woods was arguably the most famous athlete in the world and he spoke about the pressures that came with that tag. “Well, it’s a burden in   …     the amount of obligations that I have at a tournament. The anonymity that was lost   …     if you look back, the only regret I have in life is not spending another year at Stanford [where Woods attended college] and I wish I would’ve had one more year. ”

Emmys ratings sink to all-time low of 11.3 million viewers
Ratings for the Emmys have fallen to an   low, with this year’s ceremony attracting just 11. 3 million viewers. The show, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel for ABC, fell 5% from last year’s broadcast and 22% in the key demo of adults aged  . There was major competition from Sunday Night Football on NBC and a strong performance by the first part of the CBS documentary The Case Of: JonBenét Ramsey, as well as continued coverage of the New York and New Jersey bombings. In previous years, ratings have been boosted by NFL  . Despite the drop, Nielsen reported that the telecast did score 25. 9 million unique viewers for the night, which accounts for anyone who watched more than six minutes of the show. The news follows an   low for this February’s Oscars and a 34%    drop in viewers for August’s MTV VMA awards. This year’s ceremony was dominated by The People v OJ Simpson and Game of Thrones, which became the most awarded TV show in Emmys history, breaking Frasier’s record. Other key winners included Mr Robot’s Rami Malek as lead actor in a drama and another win for Julia Louis Dreyfus as lead actress in a comedy for Veep.

Where is the world’s most hi-tech city? (And it’s not San Francisco …)
Before long, Santiago could be a city full of electric vehicles charged by “smart” power grids, many of them driving on highways equipped with   automated variable toll pricing. Perhaps a new arrival to the Chilean capital would go for the chance to found a technology company, incentivised by programmes like the       Chile, in “Chilecon Valley”. And perhaps they’ll stay for the capital’s reputation boasting the most advanced public transit system in Latin America. Or they might opt for Africa instead of South America, to take advantage of the assistance offered by organisations like SmartXchange in Durban. Not only does South Africa’s third largest city now have an increasingly   middle class population, it has schools like the Durban University of Technology, whose Urban Futures Centre is even developing technological solutions to the common challenges of drug use, security and policing strategy. If these succeed, Durban, like Santiago, may count itself among the   cities sooner than the rest of the world could imagine. An urbanite cannot live by startup incubation alone  —   only implementing the latest technology within a sound built and social environment can make a city truly  . Indeed, I kept hearing the same answer from current and former San Franciscans asked to name the best such cities in the world right now: “Not San Francisco. ” Yet last year Tech Insider’s ranked the “undeniable epicentre of all things tech, from its gigantic   culture to its venture capital scene to its population of designers and programmers,” at the top spot. If San Francisco doesn’t rank among the most   cities in the world, which city could? The epicentre of tech lies less in San Francisco proper than in Silicon Valley to the south (Tech Insider’s list conflates the two). It’s the birthplace of the personal computer, now home to Apple, Google, Facebook, Intel and Stanford University, and the cradle of thousands upon thousands of startups. Only in recent years have large numbers of technology companies and their workers based themselves in urban San Francisco instead of the suburban Silicon Valley, and the resulting conflicts between the   bohemian population and these wealthy new arrivals have exposed its real, underdeveloped technological state. “Planners in 1996 had no way of predicting the tech boom,” admitted Taylor Huckaby, a representative of San Francisco’s Bay Area Rapid Transit (Bart) agency in March in response to residents’ complaints about the unreliability of the city’s transport infrastructure. They’d grown especially fed up with its commuter rail network, designed and built at enormous expense in the 1960s and 70s, much of which, Huckaby tweeted through Bart’s official feed, “has reached the end of its useful life”. No matter how much app developing innovation San Francisco attracts  —   Twitter is headquartered there  —   the experience it provides San Franciscans remains, for the foreseeable future, decidedly  . Other cities have tried to become startup hubs, offering an environment equally attractive to currently small but potentially huge tech companies. The very nature of a mature city like San Francisco, with its old buildings and layers of regulation, throws serious obstacles to   modernisation, but some city builders have addressed that problem by starting afresh and raising a     metropolis from the ground up.  Masdar City  —   a walled, Norman   development in Abu Dhabi  —   began construction in 2008 at the behest of renewable energy company Masdar. The original $22bn (£18bn) plan envisioned a community of 50, 000, its energy and other resource use to be all centrally monitored and adjusted. But the global financial crisis deferred this urban dream, greatly slowing construction, curtailing ambitious plans for a personal rapid transit system, and rendering the stated goal of full carbon neutrality seemingly impossible. Only 5% of the planned smart city in the desert stands today. A more successful example has appeared eight miles from South Korea’s largest international airport: Songdo International Business District, built over 12 years on 600 hectares of reclaimed waterfront land at a cost of $40bn. It is both the world’s first smart city and largest private development in history. Computers embedded in the streets and structures form a citywide information network used for monitoring and maintenance. A pneumatic waste disposal system, obviating the need for garbage cans and trucks, directs all refuse to an automatic central processing facility underground. With all its   computational power, Songdo aims to go beyond the concept of the high technology smart city to become a technologically “ubiquitous city”. Data sensors continually collect information on the city’s flows of water, energy, and traffic for ongoing optimisation. A partnership between Songdo’s builders and Cisco Systems  —   the Silicon Valley maker of networking equipment  —   has so far led to the installation of a “telepresence” system, which enables instant audiovisual communication between residents. It also promises the citizenry of Songdo future domestic niceties such as appliances controllable by smartphones and systems to track the whereabouts of their children. On a private tour, representatives from developer and majority stakeholder Gale International described Songdo to me as not just a technological project but an “urbanistic” one. It synthesises, they said, the best elements of such classically great metropolises as Paris (wide boulevards) New York (Songdo’s own Central Park occupies nearly 10% of its land area) and Venice (visitors can boat down canals dug for the purpose). But not even they could deny that Songdo, with its often empty public spaces and  —   apart from a few deliberately   restaurants  —   eerie historical uniformity, has yet to replicate the urban essence of those places. Yet urban essence abounds on the other side of the Sea of Japan. As host of the 2020 Olympics, Tokyo intends to use the occasion to build a model city of the future in the form of a completely   Olympic Village. It will exist, of course, within a city the rest of the world has long seen as a tech spectacle perpetually on the cutting edge.  But as any longtime resident knows, life in Tokyo, with, for instance, the   appointments at bureaucratic branch offices, can feel frustratingly   as often as thrillingly  .  High technology has permeated life far more deeply elsewhere in Asia, most notably in the city state of Singapore. Its lack of resources, small size and high population density have demanded innovative solutions to   logistical and environmental urban problems, and its wealth and   government control have made those solutions feasible. Singapore, which integrates technology and urban planning to a unique degree, pioneered the   solution to the complications of urban life. Its traffic congestion charging system  —   the first in the world when implemented in 1975  —   now uses a network of cameras, sensors, and GPS devises that foresee and head off jams by adjusting the location and amount of the charge, bringing the government $50m in revenue per year. Street crossers also play a role in this web of technology: senior and disabled citizens, for instance, receive radio frequency identification cards that will keep the crossing lights on for them  —   along with the free   internet every Singaporean gets. Though no one can deny Singapore’s technological acumen, its   image and paternalistic style of governance could be   for some. But across the South China Sea over in Hong Kong, the   region possesses equally fast internet. It has long been a part of life in Hong Kong, as has the Octopus, the contactless   system used to pay transport fares when introduced in 1997  —   but is now the payment system of choice for almost everything. The city’s increasingly ubiquitous fingerprint scanners allow its citizens easier and more secure passage to and fro. But even some of the less overtly futuristic cities in Europe also stand a chance of emerging as the most   cities of this century. Barcelona, which has perfected most of the traditional niceties of urban life, and continues to dramatically improve its streets, has more recently outfitted itself with   lights on the streets, touchscreen information stations, traffic and pollution sensors, and charging points for phones and vehicles alike. In collaboration with   universities, Spanish automaker Seat has got to work converting existing parking facilities into   service intensive, transit oriented “microcities”. But perhaps the most technologically promising European capital is on the other end of the continent: Tallinn, Estonia, the birthplace of Skype. The country plowed all the resources it could into information technology after gaining its independence in 1991, and it shows: signs point to the nearest hotspot where one can tap into the   data services available, well before they made it to the US and the UK. Over a decade ago, Tallinn became the first city to hold elections online, through the same system citizens use to pay their taxes and view all government data pertaining to them. Access to these features of Estonian technological life greatly widened when the country introduced a convenient system of   in 2014. For my part, I moved from California to Seoul. Home to such tech intensive conglomerates as Samsung and LG, the capital of South Korea has the most plausible claim to the title of the world’s most   city, despite the haphazardness of the unprecedented rapid development following its   destruction in the Korean War. “What a Londoner notices first is the ways in which the city is more advanced than his own,” historian Perry Anderson wrote 20 years ago, marvelling at this        metropolis that seemingly materialised from nowhere. “One is constantly struck by the intelligence brought to the inconspicuous details of living, as if the routines of urban existence were being freshly invented for the first time. ” South Korea’s comprehensive internet infrastructure already sets speed records, and the government plans to widely implement 5G, the next generation of wireless connections, by the year 2020. And Seoulites can connect wherever they please  —   not only at the city’s more than 10, 000 free   hot spots, but even underground, while riding one of the finest metro systems in the world.   displays keep riders apprised of the location of the next train, and the same goes for buses. Commuters can also stop at one of the station’s “virtual stores” where, simply by snapping a picture of their desired product with their smartphone, they can arrange for its delivery to their home the very same day. Yet even in Seoul, the integration of the   into urban life occasionally gets stifled: a 1999 law meant to standardise internet payment systems has forced South Koreans to use increasingly outdated web browsers, and economic protectionism (often under the banner of national security) tends to render international   sites useless, as well as mapping and   applications. However, the country has announced intentions of clearing up some of these issues by the time of the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. The fruits of humanity’s now seemingly constant technological revolutions and the living patterns of our urban population currently integrate nowhere better than they do in Seoul. Yet the title of the world’s most   city could go anywhere in the next decade: to a city about to emerge triumphantly from the developing world, to a historic capital that has turned to the future, to a slick development that has settled into its urban identity   …     or to some place as yet barely imagined.

Manchester United’s Pogba fails to live up to price tag in draw at Liverpool
As this game   Paul Pogba’s “second coming” at Manchester United stood at 10 appearances, one goal, and no     display. There had been flashes of quality but little else to suggest the world’s most expensive footballer was living up to the billing. Nearly two months to the day since his first appearance of the season  —   a promising turn in the   win over Southampton  —   here was a perfect opponent to deliver against. To be a defining factor for United against Liverpool at Anfield is precisely the kind of performance for which £93. 2m was splurged on Pogba, and why José Mourinho was so keen to make him the headline summer signing. His arrival at United caused a minor spat between the Portuguese and Jürgen Klopp. The Liverpool manager questioned Pogba’s price and voiced a hope it would not become the norm. “The day that this is football I’m not in a job any more, because the game is about playing together,” he said. “I want to do it differently. I would even do it differently if I could spend that money. ” Arsène Wegner, the Arsenal manager, spoke of similar concerns, to prompt a classic Mourinho response: “When I heard some of the comments and some of the managers criticising that, I don’t think they ever have this problem because, to have this problem, you need to be at one of the top clubs in the world. So at Man United it can happen. ” The transfer did indeed take place but so far the return on the investment has been disappointing. Part of the issue has been where the Frenchman should operate. Pogba has been in the pair of a 4‑2‑3‑1, on the   side of the middle trio in a 4‑3‑3, and last night he was shifted again, placed by his manager in the No10 berth in the former formation. This meant no Juan Mata, the playmaker preferred by Mourinho over Wayne Rooney and who was pivotal in the   hiding of Leicester City in United’s outstanding performance under the new manager. If this means Rooney is now effectively third choice for the position, then what he saw from the bench was a tentative Pogba as the contest unfolded. There was a dink to Ander Herrera that was pretty but aimless a run down a blind alley near Liverpool’s area which left him sprawling a wild   shot and a few clumsy touches that ceded possession. The plus side? A    with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the odd tackle, and that was about it. Pogba is hardly renowned for being a ball artist whose vision splits teams open. The truth is that Mata’s absence here left this United side merely a functional unit, which may have been Mourinho’s intention. They stifled and stymied Liverpool for the greater part of the first half, until Klopp’s men gained a foothold over the closing 10 minutes. This, though, was just what Pogba had failed to do as   arrived  —   establish himself. All the    did was underline Graeme Souness’s damning appraisal of him. The Scot, whose stellar career (mainly with Liverpool) makes him highly qualified to talk about accomplished midfield play, said: “Pogba may eventually be £100m worth, but right now I don’t see him anywhere near that. I see a young man who’s struggling to find his best position and best form in a team that’s struggling to find their best form. ” Yet at the interval Mourinho would have been content. His side had quietened Liverpool  —   and their support  —   and there was scant threat to their goal. But Pogba’s contribution to this was minimal, which meant as long as United kept on level terms it might be acceptable to their manager. The sense that a footballer bought to be the present and future of United should do more remained. For a club built on the scintillating talents of George Best, Eric Cantona and Rooney to have the next supposed   so muted is odd. Even when Pogba tried to   Jordan Henderson off the ball he came off second best. There was a scrap of encouragement when he supplied the cross from which Zlatan Ibrahimovic might have scored, but as the second half progressed the case grew for Mata or Rooney to enter as Pogba’s ineffectiveness meant United would have lost little had he been withdrawn. As Souness also said, United are not the lean, mean machine which Mourinho’s champion sides were. This may not help Pogba but the very best players are the ones who make a difference to the side. “I don’t see him having a great understanding of the game,” the former Liverpool manager added. It may seem harsh, but on this evidence Souness’s view can be understood. Pogba’s challenge is to prove it wrong.

Satellite eye on Earth: June 2016 – in pictures
Stagnant lakes stretch   across the upper reaches of the Volga river delta in southern Russia. The lakes are trapped by sandy mounds, left behind after the Caspian Sea’s level rose then fell in the wake of the last ice age. The United Kingdom seen from the recently launched   satellite on 9 May. At the top centre of the image, aircraft contrails form an elongated   trail in the sky, and top right, some snow still covers southern Norway. Bottom right, part of the Netherlands with Lake Markermeer clearly visible. In the southern North   Channel, an algal bloom is distinguishable in shades of light blue and green, while, closer to the coast brown sediment from rivers and streams runs into the sea. The Scottish Highlands at the tip of the UK appear light brown, representing bare soil and rock formations, with some vegetation. The rest of the island, as well as the visible part of Ireland, are very green, representing dense vegetation.  ’s Ocean and Land Colour Instrument is a new eye on Earth, monitoring ocean ecosystems, supporting crop management and agriculture, and providing estimates of atmospheric aerosol and clouds  —   all of which will bring significant benefits to society through more informed  . Scanning the monotonous,   surface of the Sahara desert, an astronaut aboard the international space station saw small, dark patches next to a long, ragged cliff in Egypt’s western desert. The dark patches are date and olive groves in the Bahariya oasis (population 27, 000) one of several small places in Egypt’s deserts where people can live. The oasis has a rich history, going back at least to Egypt’s middle kingdom (  BCE) when agricultural products from the oasis were exported to the Nile valley. Alexander the Great may have passed through, even though it is so remote (380km   of Cairo). The Valley of the Golden Mummies in Bahariya purportedly holds as many as 10, 000 undisturbed mummies of Roman and Greek aristocrats, dating from 332 BCE to 395 AD. Aqueducts built by the Roman Empire are still used today to carry water to groves and farms. In recent years, a new road between Bahariya and Cairo has brought significant tourist traffic coming to see the remnants of ancient life. Monsoon rains began arriving across India in early June 2016. For many Indians, it was not a moment too soon. After three underwhelming monsoon seasons, broad swaths of the country have been gripped by drought. An estimated 330 million people have been affected by depleted water supplies. Collectively, India’s 91 major reservoirs stood at 16% of their storage capacity on 9 June 2016, according to the nation’s Central Water Commission (CWC). That is about 58% of the water that was available in June 2015 and about 79% of the   average. Of all of India’s reservoirs, Panchet Hill in Jharkhand was among the lowest compared to the   average. In the first week of June 2016, the reservoir stood at 4% of capacity the average for June is 40%. These images show the reservoir on 10 June 2015 and 12 June 2016. The East Siberian sea wears a cap of frozen seawater in autumn and winter, with the maximum thickness occurring between February and April. As spring arrives the ice begins to thin and slowly thaw, speeding up in July. In this image taken on 4 June, ice has pulled away from the coastline in the east and the bright white ice has taken on a blue appearance as it thins and become waterlogged. Open water can be seen in the west section of the image, and a very large crack has developed running parallel to the shore.  These mountains in   in southern Kyrgyzstan are home to radioactive dumps  —   the product of former Soviet uranium tailing mines. Today the region is labelled as one of the world’s critically polluted areas. In the   grasslands in Kazakhstan one of the few features that stand out from space is Lake Tengiz, the only large lake (1, 590 sq km, 615 sq miles) in northern Kazakhstan. Through white wisps of cloud, you can see the 50   eastern shore of the lake, with its thin, winding islands and white beaches. The islands and intervening waterways make a rich habitat for birds —   at least 318 species of birds have been identified 22 of them are endangered. It is the northernmost habitat of the pink flamingo. The lake system is Kazakhstan’s first Unesco world heritage site, and it has been declared a Ramsar wetland site of international importance. Part of the richness of area is its complex hydrology. Fresh water enters the system via the Kulanutpes river, so there are small lakes (lower right) full of fresh water. But in this closed basin, the water in the main lake (top) slowly evaporates, becoming salty. Winds stir up bigger waves on the main lake, dispersing sediment and salt and making the water a cloudier and lighter  .   This map of ocean sea surface temperature, clearly shows the movement of warm water through the Gulf Stream, a powerful current of warm water running through the Atlantic Ocean. Starting in the Gulf of Mexico, the current travels around the Florida panhandle and accelerates up the east coast of the US and Canada before stretching across the ocean toward Europe. The temperature contrast along the edge of the Gulf Stream can increase the intensity of cyclones moving up the coast. During late June and July, conditions suitable for the development of tropical cyclones move from the Caribbean Sea and follow the Gulf Stream to the Gulf of Mexico or up the east coast. Instruments on satellites can measure the temperature of the surface water from hundreds and even thousands of miles away in space. These measurements can then be mapped and are a major factor for predicting weather and monitoring climate change. Arctic sea ice extent set another record low, with the average extent for May 2016 becoming the lowest extent for the month since satellite observations began, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center  This record low may not come as a surprise, however, following a record low extent in January, February, and April 2016. May’s average extent was 680, 000 sq km (224, 000 sq miles) below the previous record for the month, set in 2004. During the month, daily sea ice extents tracked roughly 600, 000 sq km below any previous year in the   satellite record. Daily extents in May were also two to four weeks ahead of levels seen in 2012, which had the lowest Arctic sea ice minimum extent on the satellite record (typically the summer melting season runs March to September). The monthly average extent for May 2016 is more than 1m sq km below that observed in May 2012. This image, from 30 May 2016, highlights the Arctic ice retreat off the   coast of Alaska. Snow blankets the mountain peaks in south central Alaska as smoke colours the skies to the west in   2016. The largest mountain range is the Alaska range, starting at the eastern border with Canada and arcing across the north of south central Alaska before ending to the west of the rugged Kenai peninsula. The arc of mountains close to the coast is made up of the Chugach mountains in the east and the Kenai mountains in the west. On the coast, Anchorage, Alaska’s most populous city, sits at the terminus of the Cook Inlet.  Thanks to a warm winter and an early, warm spring, fire risk is high across Alaska and fires have been abundant across the state, particularly in the north central region. The Alaska Wildland Fire website reported that 10, 292 lightning strikes were recorded between 6am and 6pm on 26 June, resulting in at least 37 new fires. In this image of Rome’s Castelli area Lake Albano is clearly visible on bottom right, while the town of Frascati, home to ESA’s Earth Observation Centre, is located just further north.  In 1960, 5 million people lived in Rio de Janeiro. By 2015, the population had swollen to 12. 2 million, making it Brazil’s second largest city. During the Olympics in August 2016, the city expects an additional 500, 000 people to visit. To accommodate those visitors, billions of dollars have been spent upgrading and building infrastructure, reducing crime, and addressing environmental issues. While Olympic venues are located in several neighbourhoods, most events will occur in Barra da Tijuca, a coastal neighbourhood in the city’s west zone. Barra da Tijuca is one of the youngest and most affluent neighbourhoods in Rio it is also the fastest growing. Between 1990 and 2010, the population increased threefold from 100, 000 to 300, 000. Many people were drawn to the neighbourhood by its easy access to an   ( ) beach, the longest in Rio, and a large shopping mall. These images show how the area dramatically changed between September 1984 and September 2015. Forested areas are green urbanised areas are grey. The Ojibwa tribe has a   legend that explains how the dunes of Sleeping Bear Dunes national lakeshore and two nearby islands in Lake Michigan were formed. The legend says that long ago, a mother bear and two cubs were driven into the lake by fires on land. After hours of swimming, the mother bear reached the far shore of the lake. But when she turned around to look for her cubs both of them had slipped beneath the lake surface and disappeared. The mother bear spent weeks staring out across the lake in the hopes they would eventually swim ashore, until heartbroken she finally lay down to sleep on a bluff overlooking the lake and never woke up. In recognition of her suffering, the Ojibwa say a powerful spirit covered her with sand and made her two cubs rise above the water as North and South Manitou island. Geologists have a different way of explaining the formation of the dunes and the two islands. During the last ice age, glaciers spread southward from Canada, burying the area under thick sheets of ice. As these sheets of ice slid southward, they ground parts of the underlying bedrock into sand under their tremendous weight. When the ice eventually retreated about 12, 000 years ago, it left behind large piles of sand and rock debris called moraines, creating the hilly terrain visible along the lakeshore today. Sand deposited by glaciers is the main ingredient for the “perched dunes” located on bluffs relatively high above the water level. Meanwhile, the combined pounding from winds, waves, and lake ice also built dunes at lower elevations along the shoreline from beach sand. The National Park Service uses images like this to monitor changes in the landscape over time. For example, changes in Landsat images between 2006 and 2011 showed a sharp increase in forest disturbance in 2009. During that year, a forest pathogen caused higher than normal levels of deforestation. Dust storms over the Red Sea are not uncommon. But sometimes atmospheric conditions and topography combine to produce a storm that appears extraordinary in satellite imagery. In this image of airborne dust winds appear to be blowing    out of Africa. Gaps in   mountain ranges become pathways through which winds can carry dust and sand from inland areas toward the sea. Scientists have been studying the dust in this area for a number of reasons. In general, dust in   conditions reflects sunlight and causes radiative cooling of the land and atmosphere. According to scientists, the effects on the energy balance of the Red Sea have not been well quantified. In addition, dust generated over the coastal area is often deposited in the sea. This provides an important nutrient supply to the Red Sea, which otherwise has very low nutrient levels, particularly in its more northern reaches. In late June 2016, thick plumes of smoke were rising from dozens of large wildfires   of Krasnoyarsk in   Russia. Red outlines indicate hot spots associated with fire. Notice the lack of clouds around the fires in the upper image it is possible that heat rising from the fires has prevented the formation of clouds. The lower image highlights a cluster of intense fires north of the Angara river. According to reporting by Komsomolskaya Pravda, many of the fires were triggered by lightning storms. More than 600 people have been involved in fighting the blazes. The fires are located in isolated areas and do not pose threats to population centres.    A string of wildfires burns in the Sierra Madre mountain forests of western Mexico, near the borders of the states of Chihuahua, Durango, and Sinaloa. According to data from the Mexican environment ministry, the Mexican forest fire season normally occurs between January and July. March and April are the major fire months because they coincide with the dry season. Human activities cause an estimated 97% of the wildfires, with agricultural and livestock production activity causing 54%. Urban Auckland rests on an ancient volcanic field. Look closely at this image from a RapidEye satellite and you’ll find maars (shallow   craters) and cinder cones intermingled with suburban housing developments and city green spaces.  This image of Greece, Turkey and Libya shows their distinct relief differences.

Star Trek Beyond soars to top of US weekend box office
Star Trek Beyond landed atop the weekend US box office, soaring to $59. 6m in North American ticket sales and knocking Universal’s The Secret Life of Pets from the No1 spot, according to studio estimates on Sunday. Pets was the    film at theaters, adding $29. 3m to its stellar $260m earnings to date. Paramount’s Star Trek Beyond is the third film since JJ Abrams rebooted the franchise in 2009. Despite the latest release opening $20m behind 2009’s Star Trek, experts say it’s still promising. “This is a solid enough debut to tell them there’s still enough interest in Star Trek to keep this franchise alive,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the box office tracker comScore.  Dergarabedian did not think the film was hurt by the unexpected loss of one of its stars. The actor Anton Yelchin, who played Chekov, was killed in a freak car accident last month. “The tragic passing of Anton Yelchin made it bittersweet for fans,” Dergarabedian said. The Secret Life of Pets and Ghostbusters bested the weekend’s other new releases. Warner Bros’   horror Lights Out tied with Ghostbusters for third place with $21. 6m, while Fox’s animated Ice Age: Collision Course debuted with $21m. Fox Searchlight’s Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie opened outside the top 10 with $1. 8m.

North Dakota arrest warrant for Amy Goodman raises fears for press freedom
North Dakota police have issued an arrest warrant for the Democracy Now! host Amy Goodman, who has been reporting on the Native American protests against an oil pipeline, accusing her of entering “private property” to conduct interviews. The charges have raised concerns about possible free speech violations and press intimidation, since the Morton county sheriff’s office accused the   broadcast journalist after Democracy Now! filmed security guards working for the Dakota access pipeline using dogs and pepper spray on protesters. “This is an unacceptable violation of freedom of the press,” Goodman said in a statement after police accused her of criminal trespass, a misdemeanor offense. On 3 September, Goodman reported at the site of the Native   protest of a controversial $3. 8bn oil pipeline that the Standing Rock Sioux tribe says poses a threat to its water supply and could damage its cultural heritage.  Goodman’s dispatch on the use of dogs quickly spread online and was viewed more than 13m times on the news program’s Facebook page. Many outlets rebroadcast the footage, including CBS, NBC, NPR and CNN, according to Democracy Now!. An 8 September criminal complaint was filed against Goodman and Cody Hall, a protest organizer. The charging document from the state’s attorney for Morton County calls on the defendants to be “arrested and dealt with according to law”. Lindsay Wold, a special agent with the North Dakota bureau of criminal investigation, wrote in an affidavit that a “large group of protesters” were blocking a highway and that employees of the Dakota access pipeline were working in a nearby field, “utilizing heavy equipment to clear the land”. Security workers had formed a line to try to block the activists, Wold wrote. The agent alleged that the protesters broke through a fence, crossed on to the private land, halted the employees from working, and assaulted security guards. “Amy Goodman can be seen on video on the private property that is beyond the border of the fence,” Wold wrote. The agent also cited damage on 6 September to the pipeline’s equipment, including a flat tire and dirt placed in the fuel tanks of several vehicles. Democracy Now! quoted a protester at the time describing the dogs violently attacking activists: “These people are just threatening all of us with these dogs. And she, that woman over there, she was charging, and it bit somebody right in the face. ” “The dog has blood in its nose and its mouth,” Goodman said. “Why are you letting their, her dog go after the protesters? It’s covered in blood. ” Denis Moynihan, special projects coordinator for Democracy Now! declined to comment further on Monday, but confirmed that Goodman had not been arrested. Goodman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Spokespeople for the sheriff and prosecutor’s office declined to comment. Deputies stopped Hall on 9 September, allegedly for “expired tabs” and then arrested him for two counts of criminal trespass, the sheriff’s office said in a statement. The US army, the Department of Justice, and the Department of the Interior, which is responsible for Native American affairs, announced on Friday that it would delay issuing permits to the pipeline to dig on federal land by the Missouri river, above the Standing Rock reservation. The government said that it would also discuss with tribes how “to better ensure meaningful tribal input into   reviews and decisions and the protection of tribal lands, resources, and treaty rights”. The pipeline is slated to transport fracked crude from the Bakken oil field in North Dakota to a refinery near Chicago, inspiring an unprecedented gathering of Native American protesters. Some protest organizers have lamented that although the pipeline threats echo the dangers of the defeated Keystone XL pipeline, the North Dakota controversy has received much less attention from the media and major environmental groups.  Democracy Now! said it is now consulting with the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) and lawyers in North Dakota. CCR’s legal director, Baher Azmy, told Democracy Now! “This is clearly a violation of the first amendment   …     an attempt to repress this important political movement by silencing media coverage. ” The sheriff’s office said there have been 38 arrests associated with the protest.

’Why are you still here?’ asks EU’s Juncker amid barrage of Nigel Farage
The European commission president,   Juncker, has clashed bitterly with Nigel Farage, pointedly asking the Ukip leader in front of the European parliament in Brussels: “Why are you still here?” In extraordinary scenes, Juncker said on Tuesday that he respected British democracy and last Thursday’s seismic vote for the UK to leave the European Union. There was a smattering of applause in the chamber. The former Luxembourg prime minister then broke off from his speech in French and addressed Farage, sitting to his immediate right, in English. “That’s the last time you are applauding here. And to some extent I’m really surprised that you are here,” Juncker said. “You were fighting for the exit. The British people voted in favour of the exit why are you here?” he asked. Earlier the two men had embraced each other, and swapped a few words, ahead of the parliamentary session in the Belgian capital and a summit attended by David Cameron and other European leaders. Juncker even   Farage near the cheek. But the proceedings quickly degenerated into noisy  . In his own speech Farage began by sardonically thanking his fellow MEPs for “the warm welcome” before putting the boot in.  “When I came here 17 years ago and said I wanted to lead a campaign to get Britain to leave the European Union you all laughed at me. Well, I have to say, you’re not laughing now are you?” he taunted. “And the reason you’re so upset, the reason you’re so angry, has been perfectly clear from all the angry exchanges this morning. You, as a political project, are in denial. You are in denial that your currency is failing,” Farage said. Despite urging a “ ” conversation between the EU and Britain, Farage continued in a similarly mocking vein throughout his monologue, at one point telling MEPs: “Virtually none of you have ever done a proper job in your lives. ” The MEPs responded to his oration with a mixture of boos, groans, shouts and ironic applause.  Amid uproar, the parliament’s president, Martin Schulz, tried to restore order while himself taking a dig at Farage. He told MEPs: “I understand that you are emotional, but you’re acting like Ukip normally acts in the chamber. So please don’t imitate them. ” His efforts did little to calm the atmosphere as Farage went on to tell MEPs that any attempt to impose trade barriers on the UK would backfire, claiming German   workers as being among those who would suffer. He said Britain could be “your greatest friend” provided the EU did not thwart the UK’s global ambition. The UK should invoke article 50 of the Lisbon treaty soon to begin its withdrawal from the EU, Farage said. “I don’t think we should spend too long doing it. ” Farage enjoyed support from the   French politician and Front National leader, Marine Le Pen, who spoke next. She called last Thursday’s referendum vote the “people’s spring” and “the most important historic event on the continent since the fall of the Berlin Wall”. In almost poetic tones, Le Pen exclaimed: “Dear colleagues, why are you getting het up? Look how beautiful history is! The UK is leaving!” She said Brexit was “a sign of liberty and freedom” “a cry of love” even, and signified “the great emancipation” of the British people. Others, however, dished it back to Farage in terms of bitter sarcasm.  The former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt said: “I am shocked, Mr Farage. You are presenting yourself as the defender of the little man, while you have an offshore financial construction. ”  As Farage laughed, Verhofstadt added: “OK, let’s be positive, we are getting rid of the biggest waste of EU budget: your salary. ” The German MEP Manfred Weber, a close ally of Angela Merkel, accused Farage of lying over his promise that the NHS would receive £350m a week in the wake of Brexit. “Shame on you,” he said, to loud applause.  Ukip’s only Westminster MP, Douglas Carswell, was similarly unimpressed by Farage’s performance. He told LBC radio that “resorting to that sort of language is possibly not in the national interest. It struck precisely the wrong tone. ” When the Farage kerfuffle was over, the session moved on.  The warmest applause  —   indeed, a standing ovation  —   came for an emotional Scottish MEP, Alyn Smith. “We will need cool heads and warm hearts,” he urged his fellow parliamentarians. “But please, remember this: Scotland did not let you down. I beg you, do not let Scotland down now. ”

Alan Rickman remembered by Ian Rickson
I first met Alan when I started running the Royal Court in the late 1990s. Despite how incredibly busy he was, he offered himself to me as a kind of generous lieutenant, ready to fight on behalf of the theatre, or sought to give focused and insightful encouragement. You need people like that. When I became aware that he actually played this role for multitudes of people it didn’t diminish how lucky I felt. In fact, earlier this year, when I was called to his hospital bedside days before he died, to [prepare to]direct his memorial, I realised what an impossible task it would be to include the massive range of people whom Alan had deeply touched. Here was a man who lived his socialism by repeatedly giving to others. He gave his time to a host of urgent issues his presence to organisations he believed in and in the most subtle way possible he financially supported a range of different individuals and causes that were simply in need. One thing Alan was especially passionate about was the political situation in the West Bank, and he responded to this both as a citizen and an artist. He came to me at the Royal Court with an imaginative idea to make a play from the diaries of Rachel Corrie, a young activist who tragically died when run over by a bulldozer driven by an Israeli soldier. Alongside the journalist Kath Viner and the actor Megan Dodds, Alan made a stunning show that went from the tiny Theatre Upstairs to the West End, New York, and is still produced all over the world. His direction was typically selfless, detailed and meticulous and his care of Rachel’s family, as they processed their grief through rehearing their daughter’s words, was mighty. Before I sound like I am sanctifying Alan I will add that his support and engagement, in the best sense, was often challenging. He could cut you down to size with a withering remark, make perceptive criticisms more useful than general praise, and be forcefully direct. This  —   for Alan  —   was about the level of his engagement, which was committed and principled. In this sense he was a tribal elder who we all set our compasses by. When the tribal elder passes, the tribe suffers. There is no one like him to take his place. Going back to his last weeks, earlier this year, what struck me was how all his thoughts were about those left behind: finding the right song to honour Rima, his widow, at the memorial (he chose Take It With Me by Tom Waits) choosing people who he felt would be most able to speak, and sparing those for whom it might be too demanding. Choosing material that was enlivening, amid the upset  —   like the exuberant video of Fred Astaire and others dancing to Mark Ronson’s Uptown Funk  —   as well as rousing: a speech from a French revolutionary fighter from an early TV play he’d done in the 1980s. When I asked him how he felt about dying, he said  —   after a pause  —   “calm”. Perhaps that generosity of spirit had enabled him to get his house in order (he literally furnished a new house for Rima for her new life) say goodbye to as many people as he could, and hopefully feel a sense of pride at how much he had achieved in his life. In that cold January, when Alan died (in the same week as David Bowie) you realised  —   through his popular work on screen, particularly in the Harry Potter films  —   that Alan functioned as a kind of mythic uncle figure for a generation of young people who had grown up with him. He might have seemed, in retrospect, like an icon of the establishment, but let’s not forget that Alan came from a   family in   Acton. I’m sure these roots gave him this ability to find affinity with anyone who crossed his path  —   from starstruck autograph hunters to refugees in need of shelter. Alan deplored injustice, inequality and hypocrisy. He loved the industry he worked in, and the potential of art for everyone. His celebrity was irrelevant to him, except as a tool to help give light to all the things he believed in. That light still shines. Main photograph by Stephen

Nani: ‘United contract could have been best moment of my life – but it turned into the worst’
Nani could not understand it. His mind was scrambled and the situation would affect him physically. The Portugal winger had been given a new   contract at Manchester United in September 2013 by the manager, David Moyes, and, having joined from Sporting Lisbon in 2007, he felt wanted and ready to fire himself to higher levels. Then Moyes did not play him. Or at least he hardly did so. In   Nani would start only seven Premier League games. “It could have been the best moment of my life but it turned into the worst,” Nani says. “After you sign a contract like that, you think all the people will be behind you and help you. And you see the opposite. Then the stress comes. I was down and, when it’s like that, of course, the injuries come too. It was a bad moment. It was something that made me very down, very disappointed. ” There were fewer shades of grey at the beginning of the following season under Moyes’s successor, Louis van Gaal. “He told me that, if I wanted to stay to fight for a position, then good but I would not be his first option or maybe even the second,” Nani says. “I said: ‘No. I have been here for many years, I have been very important to this club and I think it’s time to decide.’ I wanted to play every game in the starting XI. ” And so Nani ended a fitful United career, marked by flashes of genius but defined by the feeling that he never delivered on his potential. He went on a   loan back to Sporting and then signed for Fenerbahce in July 2015 for £4. 25m. He took with him a reputation for flakiness and, if he had become trapped in a spiral of decline at United, there were few people in England to predict that he would rise again. Nani has risen again. In a rare interview, with the Guardian, the    can reflect on a £7. 2m transfer from Fenerbahce to Valencia and there is excitement before the start of La Liga. His new team kick off at home to Las Palmas on Monday night. But there is something else, something fundamental. The   Premier League champion and   Champions League winner describes it as the highlight of his career. He is now a European champion with Portugal. Nani enjoyed an outstanding tournament in France, scoring three and setting up one more. But there was particular resonance to a moment from the final against France. It came when Cristiano Ronaldo, the talisman and Nani’s     in Manchester, sat down on the turf with tears in his eyes. His game was over because of a knee injury and he looked for Nani to pass on the armband. It was the biggest game in Portuguese football history  —   never before had they won a major final  —   and from the 25th minute Nani would carry the captaincy and the responsibility for driving on the younger players like Raphaël Guerreiro, Renato Sanches and João Mario. Nani’s critics have said that he does not have the broadest of shoulders. Here, he led his country to glory. “It was a very strange feeling when Cristiano went off because I was very upset about losing our captain and our best player,” Nani says. “But very quickly I had to put my head up and try to help the team, try to give them the confidence and motivation to continue. I had to do my job. I had to do what captains have to do. “The thing that changed was that I was shouting to my players, to the younger players, giving them motivation. And it was fantastic. We deserved to win and it’s in history now. It’s something we’ll remember for ever. It’s    . ” After the substitute Eder’s   goal had secured the   win, Nani was overtaken by the emotion. The words tumble out now and there is hyperbole but the   impression is that the magnitude of the achievement has yet to sink in. The moments after the   whistle were a blur and Nani says he slept for “maybe one hour” that night, as he was so excited about getting back to Lisbon for the   bus parade. “It was the best thing of my career because it was for my country,” Nani adds. “Every player wants to win something for his country. It’s amazing how the Portuguese people lived this and the feeling that they gave to us when we got home was incredible. We proved a lot of doubters wrong. We drew our three group games but when it mattered the most, we were decisive. ” Nani has long been driven by the desire to prove people wrong from his childhood in Lisbon’s impoverished and   Amadora slum district, when he told his friends he would play for United and they were not convinced. “I remember watching United’s Champions League final win over Bayern Munich in 1999 and, of course, when you watch teams like that, your dream is to play for them,” he says. “I said to my friends: ‘One day, I will play there.’ And the dream came true. If you believe and work hard, you can achieve your dreams. ” Nani won the Champions League in his first season at Old Trafford, coming on as an   substitute in the 2008 final against Chelsea and scoring with the fifth kick of the penalty shootout, which United edged in sudden death. He was voted their best player in the     season and he can look back on a clutch of spectacular goals. The ones that stand out for him are the smart finish against Liverpool in 2008 and the firecracker against Chelsea in 2011. Nani says “United gave me all that I have in this life” and his affection for Sir Alex Ferguson endures. “I see him like a father, angry and shouting at you one minute but in the next, patting his hand on your head and saying: ‘Come on, son.’ “It was hard to deal with at first, because you don’t know him and his strong ways but when you know him, you learn it is for your benefit. If today I have a strong mentality, it’s a lot to do with him. ” Perhaps Nani was frustrating at Old Trafford because his potential was so rich and, consequently, the bar was set so high. It is also true that he was not helped by the comparisons with Ronaldo, who had arrived at United from Sporting in 2003. “They were expecting me to be the next Ronaldo but that’s unfair,” he says. “We are different players, different personalities. Maybe it was a mistake to compare us. ” Nani moved in with Ronaldo for a month or so when he first arrived in Manchester and, disappointingly, he is not willing to reveal any of his friend’s bad habits. “We just had great moments,” he adds. “I needed somebody to help me to deal with things in Manchester and he was very important to me. ” The appraisal of Nani’s time at United is coloured negatively by the statistic that shows he started, on average, only 16 league games a season over his seven years. In   Ferguson’s final campaign and the one before Moyes, he had only seven starts in the league. “Maybe I could have played more games but the routine at that club, especially under Ferguson, was to alternate the players,” Nani says. “Everyone was part of the team. I played in big games and I played in not so big games. I played in finals. I had fantastic performances and I had not so great performances. This is football. “What I have in my mind is just the great moments I had in Manchester the fantastic goals that I scored against top teams. It’s what my friends remember and it’s what the fans remember, when they write to me. They don’t remember the bad things. ” Valencia have been keen to hype their new signing and have shot an   documentary entitled El Fenémeno de Nani. It might seem a little    but in reality he is a decorated former United player who has just helped his country to the European Championship. After his moment of triumph at Stade de France Nani said he thought about his journey to the top  —   from Amadora and the days at junior level when Portugal’s leading clubs would overlook him for being too small and skinny. He eventually changed Sporting’s opinion of him at a trial when he was 16. “Where I grew up it was very difficult for kids,” Nani says. “Some of them would go the wrong way  —   stealing, smoking, drugs and everything, but I never wanted to go that way. My way was that I was their friend, I saw them do the wrong things but I was with them. And, after, I go to play football. We had nothing when I was young. We were very poor but all my life I have been a fighter. I think that’s why I am here, because I will fight until the end. ”

Mexicans gave Donald Trump the hostile welcome he deserved
Mexico was the focus of the global lens last week thanks to an unexpected and dreadful event: the visit of the most rude and unapologetic US presidential candidate in political history. Why did Donald Trump come here? It was the question that millions of Mexicans kept asking ourselves while saying, “You’re not welcome!” The Republican presidential candidate arrived in my country offering diplomacy as fake as a $3 bill. He knows that he’s not welcome and was aware of his rejection, by not just Mexico but all of Latin America, and the other countries and cultures he has offended. He has not only gathered the hate and distaste of the world, but with this visit to my country he has confirmed that he is without a doubt someone who cannot be trusted. You only have to look at the stunt that he pulled on his trip to Mexico: a charade to prove the unprovable  —   civility. Trump has built his campaign based on the saying “bad publicity is better than no publicity”. It is clear that Trump loves only ratings, not credibility. His campaign is a farce and he has been deceiving his followers since the beginning. But the biggest issue is that he handles information like a virus, which has sickened the American people. Trump has said that Mexican and Latin American migrants are the ones who bring guns, crime and drugs into the US, that we Mexicans are responsible for violence. But while he points with one hand to Mexico, with his other hand he encourages the American people to arm themselves  —   according to US government figures, seven out of 10 seized weapons in Mexico come from the United States. Trump proves with such statements that he doesn’t care about facts, he doesn’t care about reality. Instead he keeps spreading his distorted point of view, suggesting that he’s completely ignorant or he’s lying. Last Wednesday, in front of the cameras he didn’t have any choice but to recognise Mexico as a commercial partner, and the hard work Mexicans do in the US. Nevertheless, a few hours later, he came out again saying that Mexico would pay for the wall, when our President Enrique Peña Nieto had said otherwise. This vile act offended not only a free and sovereign country, but his own voters as well. A guy like Trump cannot and will not show the minimum respect for anything, instead making a huge display of selfishness. He used the president of Mexico and all of the country’s citizens to his own benefit. Lies continue to gather  —   such as his support for the war in Iraq and the fact that he’s paying for his own campaign  —   and his denigration of women continues unabated. In my opinion, when someone who calls himself a leader turns out to be deceitful, it is a very low move. And yet he has stooped even lower, using the needs of his followers to validate himself with a speech full of intolerance, racism and fear. There is no way a nation could grow and prosper with no hope, values or responsibilities. History has proved that “leaderships” based on fear and ignorance are doomed to failure. I know that Trump is witnessing his own demise he’s aware that every poll is against him. In the middle of all this, he chose to come to Mexico so he could stop his ship sinking, in order to return to his own country and push on with his dishonest campaign. Well, even though I’m against walls, I’d gladly build one around Trump, to spare the world from people like him. We don’t need you.

How to catch up on … Mr Robot
As a network, USA has traditionally been the home of “blue sky” procedurals where there’s no problem that can’t be overcome in the span of 60 minutes. That’s why Mr Robot was a shock last summer. The gritty story of a hacker with a drug problem and mental health issues trying to take down capitalism by forgiving the world’s debt didn’t really make sense alongside the likes of the relatively    Royal Pains and Burn Notice. Thanks to buzz from SXSW, great reviews and a series of plot twists that kept the message boards guessing, Mr Robot became a hit for USA, winning two Golden Globes and becoming one of the most exciting shows on television.  But what if you missed out on the first 10 episodes? Well, they’re all streaming on Amazon Prime, so you could go watch them or you can find out everything you need to know below. Or maybe you watched it and just need a refresher before the new season starts on 13 July at 10pm EST. And, of course, spoilers are ahead, so if you don’t want to know what happened, shut down your computer now.  Elliot Alderson (Rami Malek): The unreliable narrator of the show, Elliot is a master hacker who works for AllSafe, a computer security firm that helps corporations protect themselves from people like Elliot. He has a penchant for illegal drugs mostly to keep his social anxiety and dissociative personality disorder in check. On the side, he uses his computer skills as a vigilante to help people, especially those who are close to him, like when he scares a married man away from dating his therapist.  The shady Mr Robot recruits him into fsociety, a group of hackers that want to use their powers to bring about the end of capitalism and take down E Corp (or Evil Corp, as Elliot and the rest of the characters on the show call it) which is also AllSafe’s biggest client. Elliot doesn’t always know what is happening because he suffers from blackouts and sometimes does things without being conscious of them.  Mr Robot (Christian Slater): A powerful hacker who lives in an abandoned amusement park in Coney Island, Mr Robot runs fsociety and wants nothing more than for everyone to be free from the shackles of debt and capitalism so that he can restart a sort of anarchic paradise. However Mr Robot isn’t real. He’s an embodiment of Elliot’s late father that only he can see, sort of like Tyler Durden in Fight Club.  Darlene Alderson (Carly Chaikin): The lead hacker of fsociety with connections to a powerful Chinese hacker collective Dark Army. She’s also Elliot’s sister. He doesn’t remember that, however, and tries to make out with her. It is gross.  Angela Moss (Portia Doubleday): Elliot’s best friend since childhood, they both lost a parent because of Evil Corp’s malfeasance. Angela is a salesperson at AllSafe and got Elliot his job there. She is the one who takes care of him, makes sure he is employed, fed and takes his medication. Because of her work at AllSafe, she’s within the orbit of Evil Corp, even though it was responsible for the death of her mother. She is getting very close with its CEO, who thinks of her as a protégé.  Tyrell Wellick (Martin Wallström): The ambitious head of technology at Evil Corp with an equally ambitious wife. Tyrell will do anything (and anyone!) to get ahead, including murdering the CTO’s wife on the roof of Evil Corp during a company event. Because he is a suspect in her murder, he gets fired from the company and starts working with Elliot.  Elliot is recruited by Mr Robot to join fsociety and help bring down Evil Corp. They launch a DDoS attack that doesn’t destroy the company but frames Terry Colby, the CTO who was responsible for the deaths of Angela and Elliot’s parents.  Fsociety plans what they call the   Hack, a complicated operation that requires social engineering (aka breaking into Evil Corp headquarters) as well as a large number of hackers working in concert. Darlene gets in touch with the Dark Army, a group of Chinese cyberpunks, who help fsociety carry out the attack.  The problem is that Elliot doesn’t remember what happens in the days leading up to the attack. He wakes up in a car in a parking lot in Manhattan with no idea what happened during the previous three days. He does know that the hack was successful, that everyone’s debt has been erased, and the American markets are in complete chaos thanks to fsociety’s attack. Also Tyrell Wellick, who Elliot was working with, has disappeared in those three days and Elliot has no idea what happened to him.  The show has added a host of new characters to the lineup. Especially prominent will be Dominique DiPierro (Grace Gummer) an FBI agent on the hunt for the masterminds behind the   Hack. Phillip Price (Michael Cristofer) the imperious leader of Evil Corp and Angela’s new mentor, and Joanna Wellick (Stephanie Corneliussen) Tyrell’s scheming wife, have been upgraded from recurring characters to series regulars. That means Angela’s focus won’t be on Elliot, but her place in Evil Corp and whether she can affect change at the company from within. Creator Sam Esmail, who directed all 10 episodes of this season, said at the Television Critics Association meeting this winter that he wants season two to focus on Elliot’s emotional journey. “For me, the headline for season two is: how do these two guys [Elliot and Mr Robot] reconcile? How does Elliot reconcile with the fact that he’s been seeing a delusion, a fantasy?” he said. Does that mean we’re going to find out that all sorts of things were delusions all along and other outrageous twists? I bet it does.

Oscar Pistorius removes prosthetic legs to walk at sentencing hearing
Oscar Pistorius, the South African Paralympic and Olympic athlete, removed the prostheses he uses for walking and running in court on Wednesday in an effort to avoid a heavy jail sentence for killing his girlfriend with four shots from a 9mm handgun fired through a closed toilet door. Pistorius, whose lower legs were amputated when he was 11 months old, removed his prostheses and made his way unsteadily across the courtroom. On the third day of a sentencing hearing in the Gauteng high court in Pretoria, Barry Roux, who leads the former athlete’s defence team, said they wanted to show the court that Pistorius was not a “strong, ambitious man winning gold medals”. “I don’t want to overplay vulnerability   …     I don’t want to overplay disability   …     It doesn’t mean because he’s vulnerable that he can do what he likes. But please let’s understand   …     who is this man that you must sentence?” Roux said. The state prosecutor Gerry Nel told the trial judge Thokozile Masipa that it was her duty to impose at least the 15 years prescribed as a minimum sentence for murder in South Africa “despite any personal doubts” she might have. Pistorius was released on bail last year after serving 10 months of a   sentence for culpable homicide, the equivalent of manslaughter in English law. His conviction was subsequently upgraded to murder by the supreme court of appeal. Masipa will now sentence the former athlete for the more serious crime.  Nel said any sentence needed to consider the needs of the community and send a strong message to deter violent crime. South Africa has some of the highest levels of murder in the world. “I cannot think of a more excessive use of a firearm than   …    . firing four shots through that doorway,” said Nel, whose belligerent style has attracted both praise and criticism. “Murder remains the most reprehensible crime   …     Society demands that appropriate sentences be imposed. We argue for   imprisonment. ”   Pistorius won global fame and fortune by reaching the   of the 400m sprint in the London Olympics of 2012 and landing a series of lucrative sponsorship deals with major brands.  The    was nicknamed the “blade runner” a reference to the carbon fibre prosthetics he used to compete, and hailed as a role model for disabled people all over the world. He killed Reeva Steenkamp, a law graduate and model, in the early hours of 14 February 2013 at his home in Pretoria.  The subsequent trial showed a darker side to the athlete, revealing a taste for guns and fast cars. Pistorius remained slumped with his head in his hands through much of Wednesday’s hearings.  The case has gripped South Africa and prompted fierce global interest. Relatives of both Pistorius and Steenkamp have attended the court, sitting within metres of each other. Both sides have sought to sway Masipa with hours of legal arguments and testimony which have seen moments of intense emotion.  On Tuesday, the father of the victim wept as he told the court said that though, with great difficulty, he had forgiven Pistorius, the former athlete should “pay” for what he had done. In emotional testimony, Barry Steenkamp described how his family had been devastated by the murder.  “I think of her every day. I talk to her. It is difficult to explain. What happened devastated us. I wouldn’t wish that on anybody in the world,” Steenkamp, 73, said. Nel told the court on Wednesday that “forgiveness has more to do with the person who is forgiving than the person who committed the crime”. “There is still that need for a sentence according to the crime that is committed,” Nel said. Earlier in the week, the court heard from a psychologist who said Pistorius was suffering serious depression, anxiety and   stress syndrome.  Roux, appearing for Pistorius, told the court on Wednesday that the former athlete had already “punished himself”. “[He] will punish himself for the rest of his life far more than any court of law can punish him. He paid from the moment he fired the shot. He has lost his future, losing his loved one. He is a broken man. He has paid financially. He has paid socially   …     He is filled with  . He has paid constantly,” Roux said. State prosecutors initially accused Pistorius of killing his girlfriend in a fit of jealous rage after an argument at his luxurious home in a gated community in Pretoria. Roux said this “incorrect version” had been rejected during the trial and should not be allowed to influence any sentence. “The accused never intended to kill the deceased,” he told the court.  Much of the legal argument around the killing has centred on whether Pistorius should have foreseen the likelihood of the death of whoever was in the cubicle when he opened fire. The former athlete has repeatedly said he thought an intruder had broken into the home and was hiding there. Nel successfully applied for the removal of a court ban imposed on the publication of graphic images of the wounds inflicted on Steenkamp. He also said that an interview given by Pistorius to ITV, the British television network, due to be broadcast after legal proceedings end, was “disrespectful”. Legal experts say it is extremely unlikely that the former sportsman will be able to challenge the sentence he receives following this week’s hearing.  He might however be able to apply for medical parole, once sentenced.  Masipa said she would announce the sentence next month.

Architect, 52, falls to death from New York skyscraper
Authorities are investigating the death of an architect who fell after apparently becoming dizzy while working on the roof of a New York skyscraper. Bruno Travalja, 52, of Ridgewood, New Jersey, died on Thursday afternoon after falling from the roof of the   building in Manhattan, police said on Saturday. Travalja took off a harness and knelt down to take some measurements, then became dizzy and fell, they said. The New York Daily News, which reached his wife, reported that he was the owner of Crowne Architectural Systems in North Bergen, New Jersey. Alexis Travalja said she and her husband started the firm that builds windows and curtain walls in their basement 11 years ago. “He was the most honest,   truthful human being who ever walked the face of the planet. It was a tragic accident,” she said. No one could be reached at the firm, which was closed on Saturday. Alexis Travalja said her husband had attended Pratt Institute, a private college known for its architecture program, and that he had later worked on a building there. They had three children. Police said Travalja fell on a   landing between 52nd and 53rd streets and suffered severe trauma to his body. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Calls to the department of buildings were not answered on Saturday.

Kickers set NFL record with 11 missed extra-points on chaotic afternoon
NFL kickers missed like never before on Sunday, setting a record with 11 failed extra point attempts. Kickers missed left, right, had kicks blocked and hit the uprights. Kickers missed in the wind and indoors. With several games left, kickers already had the most misses in one week since the NFL merger. The NFL moved   attempts back before last season because the kicks had become routine, and professionals almost never missed. The   attempt became a  . In Week 13 of last season, kickers missed eight. That mark was eclipsed by   Sunday. Cincinnati’s Mike Nugent and Robbie Gould of the New York Giants each missed two   attempts. Chicago’s Connor Barth, Minnesota’s Kai Forbath, Jacksonville’s Jason Myers, Cleveland’s Cody Parkey and New England’s Stephen Gostkowski each missed one. Seattle’s Steven Hauschka and Detroit’s Matt Prater had kicks blocked. Barth and Gould were kicking in gusty winds in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Forbath, Myers and Prater all missed despite being indoors. “It was much windier than it usually is,” Giants long snapper Zak DeOssie said. “It was a   from our bench to theirs, then it switched toward the end of the game diagonal from our tunnel to the opposite tunnel. ” Forbath had just replaced the ineffective Blair Walsh as Minnesota’s kicker this week. In the   games, Nugent’s misses arguably had the biggest impact. The Bengals lost   to the Buffalo Bills and drove all the way to Buffalo’s   line in the closing seconds. If Nugent hadn’t missed those two   attempts, the Bengals could have attempted a   field goal at the end of the game rather than unsuccessfully trying to score a touchdown.

Would Zlatan Ibrahimovic ever choose Philadelphia Union over LA Galaxy?
If MLS was ever looking for a prospective new signing to herald as their very own LeBron James, trailing his decision over which team he will be taking his talents to next, they might have found one in Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The striker last week confirmed his exit from Paris   and clubs in England, Italy and China are presenting their cases to the Swede. But reports suggest he is instead on his way to North America. Ibrahimovic could milk this even more than James ever did. When linked with a player of Ibrahimovic’s stature certain MLS clubs tend to be named. The LA Galaxy are one such club, with Bruce Arena’s side demonstrating why they could use the former Barcelona striker in their   draw at PPL Park last week. It was somewhat fitting that at such a juncture of speculation that the Galaxy faced the Philadelphia Union on Wednesday night, because if they are to dare to go for Zlatan they must go through them. The Union confirmed following the emergence of an image on social media that at one point or another not so long ago they had held the discovery rights for the   . But will we ever see the Swede running out for Philly? Well, the short answer seems to be no   and that’s coming from the club. On Saturday, Union coach Jim Curtin admitted their interest in the Swede is tactical more than anything (ESPN reports that if Ibrahimovic does sign for another MLS team then Philly would be owed $50, 000). “Is there a strategic move to have him on there? Possibly,” Curtin said. “You look at different things and different mechanisms that our league has, different unique ways that players come into our league  —   [there are] ways you can be rewarded if you’re a little bit out in front of things. ” Of course, every team in MLS could use a player of Ibrahimovic’s quality, but Saturday’s   draw between the Union and Montreal at Stade Saputo showed why the Philadelphia Union  —   with CJ Sapong leading the line as an improvised and slightly out of sorts    —   need the striker more than most. Whether they sign him or not, the club are likely to be on the frontline in the fight. With the signing of Ibrahimovic the Galaxy would boast undoubtedly the most illustrious frontline in MLS history. Hurdles must be leapt over before they can make their move for the Swede, with Robbie Keane, Giovani Dos Santos and Steven Gerrard already signed to DP deals and Targeted Allocation money already used to sign Nigel De Jong and Jelle Van Damme. A space would have to be cleared. Wherever Ibrahimovic goes, a space needs to be cleared. GR, New York City FC are tied for first place in the Eastern Conference. The Portland Timbers are just one point away from the Western Conference cellar. No, this isn’t the beginning of a Rod Serling narrative. This is as real as NYC FC’s victory over the Timbers on Sunday. Now, your take on the match really depends on your point of view. For Caleb Porter, manager of the defending MLS Cup champions, it was a painful experience. “This is about as cruel a game as I have been a part of. We dominated the game, start to finish. The pressure, possession, chance creation   we dominated,” he said.  And he is right. As Patrick Vieira admitted post match, conceding possession was not part of his gameplan. The Portland Timbers were just that good. But the larger narrative emerging from Sunday night’s encounter is the complete turnaround of New York City FC under Vieira. Were NYC FC lucky? Sure. Just look at the blatant   on the handball that led to their first goal. However, if this match had been played in 2015, NYC FC would have lost. There is no reason NYC FC should have won on Sunday. Not the way Portland played. However, City’s dogged determination, disciplined performance and team unity has propelled them to their third straight victory  —   a feat the team has only achieved one other time in their brief history. Vieira plays a major part in that achievement, particularly in harnessing the club’s fighting mentality. “The first year will be hard for any team that comes in, but now we beat the defending champions,” Mix Diskerud said. “When you see this past month and see us as a team, [we are] a group that is willing to fight together, and do whatever it takes to get the W. ” That was a sentiment echoed by team captain, David Villa. “In any league in the world, you can play good, you can take quality players, good defense, good goalkeeping, but if you don’t fight for every ball, if minute by minute you are fighting with your   against your other teammates, you are dead,” he said. “The team understood this three to four games ago and [the results are] very nice for us. ” Are NYC FC for real? Only time will tell. But for now, one thing is certain  —   they are better. And that is on Vieira. The way the New York Red Bulls were talking prior to their match against DC United, you would think the denizens of the District were the most hated people on Earth. But following a thorough   loss at RFK, perhaps that talk was simply New York reminding themselves of how they should feel. While the New   rivalry is filled with rich history and contentious battles, the most heated of those encounters remain far in the past  —   particularly from the Red Bulls’ perspective. Recent history has been solidly on the side of New York, who have taken four of the past six “Atlantic Cup” trophies while eliminating DC from the playoffs in two consecutive seasons. That has created a noticable complacency in recent matches  —   a trend which became all the more apparent in contrast to the Red Bulls’   matches against New York City FC last season. The Red Bulls were sleep walking through their assignments to start the match on Friday, allowing DC to spring into action. Another   centerback pairing in Chris Duvall and Aurelien Collin was left exposed with a perfect through ball to the feet of Patrick Nyarko. With space and time on his side, the Ghanaian midfielder comfortably served the ball across the area to Red Bull killer Alvaro Saborio for the early lead. DC doubled the lead just shy of halftime, winning the ball off of lazy possession from Mike Grella, springing two uncontested passes that ended with a goal from Nyarko. One would think New York would find inspiration at the half, being down to their historic rivals in such inauspicious fashion. Instead, it was DC with a nose for goal in the final stanza. New York’s response? Well, that came in the form of apologies after the match. “I just need to apologize to the fans for that performance,” said Red Bulls skipper Dax McCarty. “It’s one of the most embarrassing performances I’ve been a part of since I’ve been at this club. There’s no excuse for it. It’s sad in a rivalry game, to let them off the hook like that and not be up for the challenge. Red Bull boss Jesse Marsch assumed “the load of responsibility” for the team’s listless performance as well. “We came into a rivalry game, one that we knew would require a team that was always up for the competition and for the night, and we came up zero for 11 on that. ” This isn’t meant to take away from the performance of DC. Ben Olsen  —   a veteran of the   wars  —   had his players prepared to take on their hated rival, and Travis Worra made some spectacular saves early in the match to keep his team ahead. But the motivation on both sides was clear. In other words, DC got it. “It’s a rivalry,” DC United’s Sean Franklin said after the match. “They’re a team that we hate and they hate us. ” On Friday night, only half of that statement rang true. DM, They say a week is a long time in soccer, and it’s an even longer time if you’re Kei Kamara. In that time the Sierra Leone forward managed to have a blazing   row with a   one Saturday, then secure a trade and start for his news side the following Saturday. Kamara’s possessions are probably still sitting in a   truck somewhere in Columbus, but he has already demonstrated the difference he will make for the New England Revolution. Of course, there was perhaps little surprise in the impact Kamara made for Jay Heaps’ side in the   home win over the Chicago Fire. He finished as MLS’s top goalscorer last season, finding the net 26 times as the Columbus Crew made a run all the way to MLS Cup. Had it not been for a certain Atomic Ant carrying an entire team, franchise and the CN Tower on his back, Kamara would have been 2015’s MVP.  Against Chicago Kamara demonstrated his quality from the start,   the Revolution’s ailing frontline and recording six shots on goal (no New England player has tallied that many shots in a match all season). There was an energy to the Revs’ performance that has been lacking for quite some time, and that was down to Kamara. His signing could be a   moment for his new team. Kamara has been painted as the pantomime villain in some quarters over his behaviour at Columbus this season, but he did have justifiable grounds for complaint. The Crew should have handed the forward a Designated Player deal much sooner than they did, with the relationship between the two parties already damaged by the time pen was put to paper. Maybe he was right to feel undervalued. Greg Berhalter and Columbus feel they got the better of the deal that sent Kamara to New England, but even at 32 he is a   and a  . “I want to thank Columbus, obviously,” Lee Nguyen joked after the win over Chicago. “[Kei’s a] great addition. He’s so smart, so athletic, and he wins everything. You’re going to have to watch him. It adds another dynamic to our attack. ” Indeed, the Revolution have a lot to thank Columbus for. Heaps should probably add Berhalter to his Christmas card list. GR, Glance at the standings in the Western Conference and one team stands out as the 2016 season’s surprise package so far   the Colorado Rapids. Often the league’s most tediously tragic side last season, the Rapids have become this year’s unlikely frontrunners, staying top of the table despite Saturday’s   road draw against the Columbus Crew. And yet at Mapfre Stadium there were fleeting signs for apprehension as far the visitors were concerned. Not so long ago Pablo Mastroeni was the subject for much criticism over his team selectios. They were seemingly made by pulling balls randomly out of a hat. The former USA international midfielder experienced some sort of realisation over the   though, and things have been very different this term. In a sense, perhaps a little too different. Mastroeni has stuck with the same starting lineup for much of the season, giving the Rapids a sense of stability and consistency that has been central to Colorado’s streak. However, that means squad rotation has been minimal, with the first signs of fatigue and stagnation coming in the draw against the Columbus Crew on Saturday evening. The Rapids looked completely sapped of energy late on at Columbus, with their frontline suffering most. They were slow in thought and action, with the Crew making the most of their opportunity to claim a point against the league leaders. There are a lot of players on Mastroeni’s team who have played a lot of minutes and it showed. Mastroeni should have seen this coming. Saturday’s fixture was the final leg of a stretch that saw the Colorado Rapids play three games over just eight days. They stuck with largely the same   for much of that run, with the Colorado boss also reluctant to use his substitutes to refresh his side even when they are so blatantly flagging. All this points to a coach with little   in what he has achieved this season, stumbling across something so successful he is now fearful of deviating from it. What’s more, the Rapids have options  —   like Dillon Powers and Dillion Serna  —   who Mastroeni is currently overlooking. The Colorado boss has enjoyed an unprecedented start to 2016, but now he must recognise what is needed to maintain it. GR

Soweto uprising 40 years on: the image that shocked the world
The sky above was dark with smoke. At the railway station, as Ntsiki Makhubo and her mother returned from a day in Johannesburg, they were met by an anxious crowd. As they stepped down from the train, they trod on shattered glass and heard the news. Your brother has been shot and killed, Makhubo was told. When South African police opened fire on marching schoolchildren in the township of Soweto on 16 June 1976, Makhubo’s neighbours had seen her older brother,    Mbuyisa Makhubo, drenched in blood and staggering to a clinic, carrying a limp boy in his arms. They assumed he had been gravely hurt. In fact, it was the    boy Mbuyisa had scooped up in the midst of the chaos who lost his life that day. His name was Hector Pieterson. A photograph of the two taken by a local journalist was printed first by a local newspaper, and then around the world. It would go on to have a huge impact, prompting global outrage at the police’s brutality, becoming an iconic image of the struggle against a hated racist system and prompting a new wave of protest that would eventually lead to the end of apartheid. Today, South Africa commemorates the 40th anniversary of the Soweto uprising, as that day is now known. No one knows exactly how many people died  —   estimates range from 150 to 700 during the months of subsequent violence. But the anniversary  —   like the famous photograph  —   will provoke a variety of reactions, not all of them easily reconciled. “The uprising means different things for different people,” says Khwezi Gule, chief curator of the Hector Pieterson museum and memorial in Soweto. “There are different generations and varying constituencies. Even those who were there in 1976 were affected differently: parents, students, leaders, people just caught in the crossfire. ”  Much attention has been focused on Pieterson and the screaming girl in the picture, his younger sister Antoinette. Both were pupils at local schools and were marching to protest against the introduction of compulsory tuition in Afrikaans, seen as just one more humiliation for students crammed into deliberately overcrowded,   schools designed to deny, rather than provide, education to South Africa’s black majority. There were deeper factors too. A new generation had lost faith in its political leaders, who were mostly in jail or exile, and many were contemptuous of parents who they thought had accepted apartheid’s humiliating restrictions.  Pieterson, although not particularly politically aware, had joined his school friends to march through the dirt streets of the sprawling township to a local stadium. Police blocked their way. A standoff followed. Stones began to fly. Teargas filled the air. Then the shooting started. “There was confusion. I saw people hiding themselves and then I hid myself too. I was afraid because I didn’t know where Hector had gone to . .. then I moved forward and I   …     saw Hector’s shoe,” Antoinette remembered 15 years later.  It was then that Mbuyisa Makhubo picked up the boy and began to run. There was little point  —   he was dead before he reached the nearest hospital. But if the Pieterson family were shattered by the events that day, the Makhubo family were soon to suffer too for Umbiswa’s impulsive act of kindness. The family had already paid a heavy price for their involvement in the   struggle. Key African National Congress (ANC) leaders such as Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu had been family friends before being jailed, and the Makhubos were well known to authorities. Mbuyisa, his other two brothers and sister Ntsiki were frequent visitors at Mandela’s Soweto home where Winnie, his second wife, sometimes cooked for them. “She also helped me register for college,” Ntsiki said. “We used to go over and eat there: spinach and pap [maize flour mash] or sometimes grilled meat. ” Mbuyisa’s father had joined the Umkhonto we Sizwe organisation (MK) which waged a campaign of sabotage and violence within South Africa in the early 1960s. Forced to flee to avoid prison, he lived in ANC camps in neighbouring countries before dying in 1973 in Kenya. Within days of the Soweto uprising of 16 June, it became clear that Mbuyisa would follow his father into uncertain exile. “I was very close to my brother. After that day, when he had carried the boy, he was disturbed, distressed. He was harassed all the time by police and journalists. Eventually he said, ‘I have to go’ and I packed him a small bag and he left for the border, to Botswana. He wrote for a while but after five years, the letters stopped. We never saw him again,” Ntsiki said.  Recently, there have been reports that Mbuyisa has been found in Canada, but no firm identification has been made and Ntsiki remains sceptical.  The family were to suffer more over the coming years as the government intensified its brutal efforts to maintain the apartheid system in the face of massive opposition, economic crisis and international opprobrium.  In 1985, it was the turn of another Makhubo son to flee: Ntsiki’s second brother. He also joined MK and left South Africa for training as a guerrilla fighter. He remained in exile until the ANC took power and Nelson Mandela became president in 1994, but died of Aids five years after returning to his homeland.  Since then, the fortunes of the Makhubo family have steadily improved  —   like those of their nation. Though Ntsiki herself still lives in the rundown   house on Litabe Street  —   from which her brother set out 40 years ago to join a march  —   her own children have grown up knowing relative peace. Two of them live in Cape Town, where one is a university student and the other is a supermarket manager. The third, Zongezile, a stylish    still lives in Soweto, where he runs a tourism  .  For Zongezile, the commemoration of 1976 sends an important message. “The memory of Hector Pieterson and my uncle means sacrifice and selflessness, but it also means change,” he said. Soweto itself is certainly transforming. There are car dealerships, new roads and bus stations, and shopping malls with major western brands. An influx of tourists to the area around the site of Hector Pieterson’s killing  —   now marked with a signboard  —   has prompted a   of souvenir shops and restaurants serving “authentic” Soweto cuisine. The Hector Pieterson museum opened in 2002 and now has 90, 000 visitors a year. Many are schoolchildren and students, who smile and pose in front of the picture of Mbuyisa carrying the dying boy. Few of these youngsters who visit know much of the uprising, nor are they particularly interested. “I’d say out of the 40 or 50 school kids I usually take round the museum in any one group, you’ll have three or four who either know something or engage,” said Liz Block, a lecturer and volunteer tour guide. Ntsiki is concerned by this lack of knowledge, and fears violence might return. She was horrified when dozens of protesting mineworkers were shot dead by police near Johannesburg in 2012, and by a series of recent brutal clearances of squatter camps. “Was the sacrifice worth it? There are a lot of positive things no doubt. A lot has been done. I am proud to be a South African. But I am still saddened. There is much that is wrong. People are still being gunned down in squatter camps when they protest. We didn’t fight for that,” she said.  In parts of Soweto too, deep poverty remains. In some areas families are crammed into   hostel housing. In others, poor immigrants from rural areas or neighbouring countries rent tin shacks for £25 a month. The contrast with the touristy areas of Orlando West, let alone the wealthy suburbs of Johannesburg only a   drive away, is striking.  In Kliptown, on the   fringe of the township, 45, 000 people live on dusty streets without access to schools or jobs. The area suffers from endemic drug abuse and violent crime. Angry community leaders talk of betrayal by their elected representatives.  “The government and politicians will come by for the celebration, do their campaign, host their events, but it has nothing to do with us,” said Bob Nameng, who runs a local community programme. But Zongezile Makhubo insists that, despite all the problems facing South Africa and Soweto 40 years after the uprising, he is hopeful. “Some here overlook the good we have achieved in the years of democracy and just look at the problems,” he said. “But we have shown that our country unites to face the challenges. Everyone comes together and says we must do what we can to help and that this is the country we love. ”

How are Clinton and Trump polling before the first debate?
In January, I wrote: “In the first 26 days of this year, 186 political polls were released. ” Since then, I’ve lost count.  New numbers are released every day by different organizations (some academic, some corporate and some media businesses themselves) and they all depict a slightly different political reality.  To state the obvious, in 2016 political reality is very different from that of previous presidential elections. And not just because the two remaining candidates are the least popular for more than 30 years. It’s also because polls, which have come to be the manna of political analysts, now offer less help in making sense of it all. In past elections, the polls had settled down by Labor Day. This year, they continue to point all over the place. On Sunday, a survey by the Economist and YouGov found that Hillary Clinton had a lead of 4%. Less than 24 hours later, a poll from the LA Times and USC Tracking put Donald Trump 4% ahead.  Both pollsters are considered credible, which makes this even more confusing.  This series is intended to help you make sense of the ceaseless onslaught of numbers by taking a closer look at just one poll. But to start us off, I want to talk about a crucial tool in polling analysis: the average.  The site Real Clear Politics (RCP) takes the average of all recent credible polls to create a moving average. Right now, RCP has Clinton with 45. 9% of the vote while Trump has 43. 8% meaning that the Democratic nominee is ahead by 2. 1%.  Notice how Democrats aren’t singing from the rooftops or gloating on Twitter? It’s because 2. 1% means nothing. It’s so small, it could be down to errors in the ways that polls are conducted. It’s so narrow, it could easily be reversed by individuals who change their mind or who are not honestly disclosing how they plan to vote.  The takeaway? Going into tonight’s debate, the two candidates are neck and neck.  But how much do debates matter? As my former colleague Lauren Leatherby has pointed out, they have hurt candidates in the polls (see Barack Obama in 2012 and George Bush in 2004). But ultimately those candidates have been able to recover by election day (see, uh, the same candidates).  So even if tonight produces a clear loser, the November vote is not a done deal.

Donald Trump’s latest trick: turning Mike Pence into media catnip
Donald Trump has done the impossible: he has made Mike Pence interesting. The governor of Indiana, a social conservative, looks like a politician from central casting, a   Hoosier who might sit silently behind any president through any State of the Union speech. In recent weeks, as the Trump veepstakes dragged on, he stayed relentlessly scripted, perpetually  . Next to the other finalists, the former House speaker Newt Gingrich and the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, he lacked star power. He lacked pizzazz. Then, with an existential crisis more worthy of a candidate for prince of Denmark than president of the United States, Trump changed all that. After news of Pence’s choice leaked on Thursday afternoon, first to Roll Call and then confirmed to at least a dozen other outlets including the Guardian, Trump suddenly insisted that it wasn’t a “final, final decision”. He prevaricated in TV interviews and canceled his scheduled VP announcement in order to pay tribute to the victims of the truck attack in Nice.  Through it all, and a round trip on a private jet from Indiana to New York on Thursday, Pence remained silent. The clock, however, was ticking. Pence had until noon on Friday to withdraw from his   campaign in Indiana, or else be ineligible to run for   under state law. Sensing this, his rivals for VP tossed out fiery rhetoric, in an attempt to convince Trump to change his mind.  Most strikingly, Gingrich went on Fox News to say: “We should, frankly, test every person here who is of a Muslim background and if they believe in sharia, they should be deported. ” This all added immense drama to what otherwise would have been a relatively dull process. Pence was the safe pick, but instead of a strategic leak the night before an announcement then safely confirmed by the campaign, there began a dramatic “he said, she said” news story, full of twists and turns.  Eventually, just before 11am on Friday, Trump tweeted that he had chosen Pence. The crisis was resolved. Apparently. But on Saturday morning at a midtown Manhattan hotel, Trump still delivered a strikingly unorthodox rollout. The billionaire took the stage just after 11am and delivered a nearly       monologue.  Pence was barely mentioned. Trump talked extensively about himself, bragging that “no one in the history of this country has known so much about infrastructure as Donald Trump” and even insisting that “school choice is where it’s at, folks”. He weighed in on the coup attempt in Turkey, saying: “As far as Turkey is concerned, so many friends in Turkey, great people, amazing people, we wish them well. It looks like they are resolving the difficulty but we wish them well, a lot of anguish last night but hopefully it will all work out. ”  He also attacked Hillary Clinton and bragged that he had predicted the result of the British referendum on whether to leave the European Union. “I think it was a win for them,” he said. It was bizarre  —   and, sure enough, it grabbed the media’s attention. Most presidential candidates introducing a running mate deliver a paean to their chosen one. Trump talked about every topic under the sun, occasionally mentioning Pence but then digressing.  Eventually, the Indiana governor took the stage. Trump quickly left it. There wasn’t even time for a decent picture of the two men embracing. Left on his own, Pence gave a solid but unspectacular speech. He hit all the right notes but with no flights of fancy, no moments of inspiration. Save for the comment that he received a phone call on Wednesday offering the VP position, a statement that ran contra to the narrative as reported, it was entirely forgettable. He had no need to say anything interesting. In the zigzagging drama of the past 48 hours, Trump had successfully created yet another unorthodox spectacle.

William Tyler: Modern Country review – Americana too sublime for words
American guitarist William Tyler’s excellent fourth album begins with an anxiety attack and ends with an interpolation of Dire Straits’ Sultans of Swing so subtle, I’m still not sure it’s there. The instrumental album strung between those two poles is of such eloquence it renders them superfluous. Context almost gets in the way. Modern Country is a beatific and expansive ambient record daubed in acoustic and electric guitars, analogue oscillations, some really scary bells and no words its meaning can be fluid. But, as Tyler tells it, the album came about when this former member of Lambchop and Silver Jews  —   latterly celebrated for his lyrical acoustic fingerpicking  —  had a panic attack on an interstate. Touring musicians can’t afford such phobias Tyler turned disaster into opportunity, taking the roads less travelled. It was an enforced slowdown soundtracked by country music and the German motorik of the 70s, the sine qua non of driving music. Both traditions, alongside   and Knopfler, find their way onto this lush study of Americana that thrums with a love of the South, a place not synonymous, Tyler argues, with the worst of its past. Kingdom of Jones, a roiling, bright fingerpicked raga, bears witness to Jones County, Mississippi, a historically   enclave. The vanishing America of truck stops and   towns is a cliche now, its bleakness long riffed on in films, photography and song. But Tyler’s parents come from small Southern places, and he returned to a cabin in their university town to write this set of spacious songs, where tradition and transcendence mix. Albion Moonlight reverberates with twang, but behind the guitars, it sounds like someone is working sheet metal next door. The Great Unwind  —   the album’s heroic closer  —   takes its name from New Yorker writer George Packer’s celebrated 2013 account of American inequality. You want to punch the air at the unexpected electric guitar solo. Midway through, there are roughly 30 seconds of undiluted birdsong. Highway Anxiety, meanwhile, betrays no fear, as though Tyler wrote it to soothe himself. The bittersweet melody, the   chord progressions, the sense of acceptance  —   it’s all succour, designed to make your blood pressure drop. Just shy of three minutes in, Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche’s kit rattles into life and Tyler’s awesome band (completed by bassist Darin Gray (Jim O’Rourke, Tweedy) and Justin Vernon associate Phil Cook on keyboards) slip into gear, the austere acoustic framework of Tyler’s previous album, 2013’s also excellent Impossible Truth, receding into the   mirror.

Syrian family’s journey from Isis jail to audience with the pope
Sitting in the hushed and ornately gilded lounge of a Rome hotel, Carolyn Tamras perches on the edge of a   pink velvet sofa. For three days last year, says Carolyn, she sat “like this” leaning forward and wrapping her arms around her knees, head bent, gently rocking. “Then I thought, I am no use to my family like this. This is my challenge. ” It is her husband Martin’s 49th birthday and the couple can scarcely believe that he has just been wished many happy returns by Pope Francis in a private audience. They are still glowing from the experience, as any fellow Catholics would be. But there is a unique dimension to their joy: on this date last year Martin, their two sons, then teenagers, and their daughter, were being held in an Islamic State torture centre. He was wearing an orange jumpsuit and waiting to be killed, having seen his cousin and two other men put to death in front of him. Syrian Christians, Martin and Carolyn lived with their three children in Tal Tamr, a little town 25 miles from the city of Hasakah, in the   of the country. On 23 February 2015 Isis arrived, bombing and burning homes and churches. Surrounding houses, the militants   exits with explosives, trapping people inside while they took out any armed resistance. They then returned to usher 97 men, women and children out of their temporary prisons and into trucks. By chance, Martin and Carolyn were away shopping in Hasakah that day and the couple had decided to stay the night rather than drive back. As they prepared to go to bed, Martin got a phone call from his son, Tommy. “Daesh are here! They have surrounded us!” Martin persuaded his wife to let him drive back to the village alone. “I lied to her,” said Martin. “I didn’t tell her what he said, I knew she would not stay in safety if I told her the truth. ” He arrived in time to be herded along with the others, Christian, Muslim and Hindu. They were held in brutal, overcrowded conditions, forced to witness electrocutions and beheadings, given water polluted with diesel and food that was infested with insects.  Although the father and sons were held together, with the other men from the town, their daughter was held separately in a group of women who were constantly taunted that they were to become Isis “brides”. For 12 months, Carolyn and religious groups were bombarded with demands for $16m (£12m) in ransom. A video of three men being killed was sent to them as a threat. Martin was in the video, clearly marked out for future death. As a desperate effort began to raise money, Carolyn had to endure the taunting contact of an Isis negotiator through the messaging service WhatsApp. “At first I was disgusted, but then I realised he was human and through this humanity I might help my family. He began to trust me, to tell me about his sick baby. I looked up what medicines might help and sent him back details. ” The couple believe this human contact between Carolyn and Isis is what kept Martin alive. “Because Isis founded their actions based on religion, this is a challenge,” said Carolyn. “Isis may be Islamic, but it is unfair to judge Muslims by Isis. We have to judge on human values, meet on human values. I saw humanity in that man,” she said. The family’s release came as unexpectedly as their capture. Hearing a rumour that buses had been seen arriving in Tal Tamr, Carolyn and other relatives rushed to the desolated village. More than $5m had been raised and handed over, some via Catholic clergy in Syria, some via the Assyrian church  —   the family do not know the details and the issue of the ransom is difficult. “Slaves, bought and sold,” Martin said. “I could not believe this. Going back 1, 000 years to slavery. This is painful for me. ” As a middleman handed over sacks of banknotes to the Isis fighters, the 93 hostages stepped off the buses. Carolyn remembers: “I was running, running, like a crazy woman! I saw Tommy first, then my youngest, and I had my arms around them both, hugging, hugging. I couldn’t believe it was real. ” Martin grins: “She forgot me! So I had to tap her on the shoulder and say, ‘Excuse me, madam, do you not recognise your husband? ’” The children had witnessed terrible barbarity  —   their daughter talked of decapitations where heads “were lined up like tomatoes” on walls for children to play football with  —   but they are, her mother says, coping. The hostages all now suffer from kidney and lung complaints, after a year of water fed through pipes used for diesel, and days on end in packed cells in which no one had the space to lie down. One of Martin’s first tasks after release was to talk to the families of the three dead. “The doctor, his sister, still will not believe it,” he says sadly. Another captive  —   a girl picked out to be raped by a judge in Raqqa who had looked among the hostages for a “wife”  —   is still missing. “And, of course, we are still trying to help the father of this girl to find her. ” Their homes razed, the hostages cannot return to Tal Tamr. Of the 45 families affected, only two remain in Syria. “I understand why,” says Carolyn. “Yes, we lost everything, our home, everything we owned. But if we leave Syria you cannot stand up for peace. We lose our power. I hope we give Syrians courage. “It is my dream to rebuild our home in Tal Tamr. To say, ‘we are here, we live here’. This is my dream. ” Their story is one they now hope to use. By coming forward as peace campaigners, the family hope to begin working to bring unity to Syria’s traumatised faiths even as the civil war rages on. “It’s an important opportunity for us to be here because the business of our faith is peace, and so we have a duty to witness this fundamental conviction and to share the story and the message of mercy and love with others,” says Martin. “Much is written in books about theology this is not theology, this is life. We have been forced to confront the worst and our role is now to be witnesses. It is a real test to believe in mercy,” he says. “Of course at first I want to kill these Daesh. I want revenge on those who take my children and who kill my cousin and my friend in front of me, and who taunt me that I am next. Those who mock my wife and destroy my home, who want to buy and sell human beings. “Yes, I want justice, I want them to be brought to justice, but I will not hate them, and I will not hate my Muslim neighbour. It’s important to think, to go back to family, to faith and to education . .. only forgiveness breeds peace. Only peace makes us comfortable. We will work together,” he says. “In Syria, we are not unique. This is universal. People across the world are living in such difficulties, what is important is how we confront it. ” On Martin’s big day at the Vatican, he received a congratulatory phone call from the family. Hasakah is relatively peaceful at the moment. “For the last two weeks at least we feel safe,” says Tommy, on his father’s mobile phone screen, his grinning little brother beside him. Their parents light up at the sight of their boys. “This is my only regret,” says Carolyn, “that the family could not all be here together. ” If all five had been in Italy together, would that mean she wouldn’t have gone back to Syria? “Oh no,” she said. “I want our message to be to those who harmed us: ‘We will stay here in this land to fight them, to fight them in peace.’ We are luckier than the refugees because our family is alive and still together in Syria. My daughter was not harmed by these men. We are lucky. ” Yesterday Carolyn gave a speech in Rome on her belief in mercy, on forgiveness and on peace. Today, as the bells ring out across St Peter’s Square, they will be going home, to the war zone where they have chosen to remain. The quality of mercy has been exalted by writers from Shakespeare to Voltaire. Pope Francis has made “blessed are the merciful” one of his key teachings. According to Fadi Daou, the chair of the   Adyan Foundation, a peace organisation that made their trip to Rome possible, mercy has found its perfect role models in Martin and Carolyn Tamras.

Against all odds: why Phil Collins’ comeback could save pop music
When news broke yesterday that Phil Collins was returning to live performance, some Guardian commenters reacted with utter horror. “As if we haven’t suffered enough this year,” wrote a miffed chrisf242. Lbonifacio also pulled no punches: “I thought it could not get worse. ”  Other commenters were more positive, but it’s clear that Collins’s return will be met in many musical quarters like the election of Donald Trump. You see, it’s hard to remember a time when Collins wasn’t a figure of   revulsion to a certain kind of music fan. That was truest in the 1980s and 90s, when he was selling a   100m records (one of only three artists to do so) and wearing some very bad jackets.  Back then, he was painfully unavoidable. Across the world, no chart was safe from his mushy AOR. No back seat of a taxi or supermarket aisle offered sanctuary from a sudden unexpected assault by Easy Lover or One More Night. For the multitudes of    —   who easily numbered as many the fans  —   Collins made “BMW music”.  When Bret Easton Ellis created the   stockbroker Patrick Bateman for American Psycho, his final horror de resistance was making the     sociopath an obsessive Phil fan: “Do you like Phil Collins? I’ve been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I really didn’t understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins’ presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch is the group’s undisputed masterpiece. It’s an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Christy, take off your robe. ” Nevertheless, these also serve as reasons why Phil Collins’ return is unutterably, wonderfully, brilliant news. In fact, it might be the best thing to happen to music this year. It’s been aeons since we had such a convincing musical bete noire. Even before Collins retired in 2011, pop had become mostly crushingly mediocre. Everything is nice, perfectly produced and marketed. We are all cool. But there’s been nothing to rail against. Only last week, when I asked some music journalism students if they had any desire to “barbecue the dinosaurs” (as the gunslinging NME critics of the 70s and 80s were fond of saying of the likes of Collins and Rod Stewart) the room fell strangely silent. Perhaps that reflects the fact that the dinosaurs were never cooked at all, and in fact most of them are still touring, and being fawned over in the monthlies and by young and old alike. “I’d quite like to destroy Coldplay,” someone offered eventually, but while poor Chris Martin’s quartet have replaced Phil as   name for anyone seeking an instant example of what’s wrong with music, their output and critical reputation is like that of the Sex Pistols compared with Phil Collins a couple of decades ago. On a human level, it’s hard to begrudge the man, now 65, a final day in the sun after what sound like some seriously dark times: a third divorce, all manner of   injuries, which left him unable to drum at all, a public image nosedive following the tabloid depiction of him as a Tory tax exile who dumped his wife by fax (which he has since explained was all untrue) and a descent into alcoholism. At least he seems to have regained his sense of humour  —   and desire to get back at the critics  —   with the title of the forthcoming tour, Not Dead Yet. And then there’s the    matter of his contribution to British music. Yes, we may sneer at the mopey divorce ballads (although Kiss’s     frontman Paul Stanley, of all people, has been known to praise the ostensibly gooey Against All Odds for its “stunning, desperate vulnerability”) but we shouldn’t forget that Collins, as    powered Genesis through four decades, from cult prog rock band to   adult pop sophisticates. He played on Brian Eno’s brilliantly trailblazing albums in the 70s, and with the likes of Robert Wyatt. He pioneered the innovative gated drum sound that can still be heard throughout pop. American RB types consider him pop royalty. I even play Phil Collins drum fills in my   band (giving the killer drum motif from In the Air Tonight a new home in an intense, Joy   angular rock stomper). Granted, none of Phil’s influence on obscure Yorkshire trios, or indeed any of his contributions to the more avant garde end of pop, are likely to feature in his five nights at the Royal Albert Hall, but maybe some of that   solo material is due a reappraisal. One could argue  —   and I will  —   that If Leaving Me Is Easy’s moving electronic minimalism paved the way for James Blake, that Sussudio audibly reveals a Prince influence, and that few mainstream pop smashes are as inventive as In the Air Tonight. Collins will always divide opinion, but there’s every chance that his   hits  —   freed from the shackles of Magic FM ubiquity  —   will make next year’s gigs a final triumph. And if not? Perhaps somewhere, whether in Surbiton or Scunthorpe, some kid will be infuriated enough by the return of the Great Satan to reach for the nearest instruments and invent the angry, new future of rock’n’roll. At face value, we’re all winners here. But seriously   …     Welcome back, Phil.

Clashtag: British Olympians ’steal’ #GBR from Nebraska Huskers football fans
On the   plains of Nebraska, the abbreviation “GBR” means a specific thing to supporters of the University of Nebraska football team.  The Cornhuskers, so named in honor of the home state’s agricultural heritage, have won five collegiate national titles and 880 games since being founded in 1890, the   of any   university in the United States. They’re a big deal in the land of cows, corn and college football. And when a fan of the team roars “Goooo Biiiig Reeeed”  —   on the way into Memorial Stadium on a fall Saturday, at a pancake breakfast in a church basement, at the gas station or really anywhere in or around Lincoln, the state’s capital  —   she expects to hear a quick “Go Big Red” in response.  This is the cadence of a football season in Nebraska, and on Twitter, in Cornhusker circles (fans refer to themselves as Huskers) that traditional chant gets shortened to #GBR. Lately, however, Nebraska football fans using the hashtag have noticed something new popping up in their social media feeds as the Olympics get under way in Brazil. A Union Jack.  That’s because #GBR is accompanying tweets about the British Olympic team at the games in Rio. Using #GBR on Twitter now conjures up a “hashflag” a small, emoji graphic deployed for big events. The Uefa Champions League final in May had a small depiction of the European Champions Clubs’ cup, and February’s Super Bowl had a tiny Vince Lombardi trophy. Understandably, the hashflag has ruffled the feathers of Cornhusker fans. As sports blogger Husker Mike lamented on Tuesday: “. .. all of a sudden, the #GBR now has the British Union Jack attached to it. Wait . .. didn’t we win two wars against the British so that we were free of England, her Majesty and that flag?” It has also caused some consternation as fans mourn the loss of beloved    kicker Sam Foltz, who died in a car accident on 23 July. Kyle Hobbs, a Lincoln resident, was at a nearby casino when he learned of Foltz’s death and tweeted out his support, only to see a British flag accompany his words. “I tweeted so fast I thought maybe I accidentally hit a flag emoji. ” Perhaps no one in America monitors the GBR hashtag as closely as Kelly Mosier, the University of Nebraska athletic department’s director of digital communications. One of his duties is to manage an official university Twitter account with more than 278, 000 followers. Mosier first recalled Cornhusker fans first noticing a British flair accompanying their tweets during the EuroVision Song Contest 2015. He wasn’t surprised when the flag popped up again this month.  “There’s literally nothing we can do. It’s the Olympics. It’s not like we’re going to call Twitter and say, ‘Hey, you’ve got to stop doing that,’” Mosier said. “It’s a big world. There are lots of people talking about lots of things. ” That hasn’t stopped Nebraska fans from proposing some   ideas as to how to handle the great #GBR conundrum of 2016.  Lance Knapple, an investigator for the state of Nebraska, tweeted at the official Nebraska athletics Twitter account that a football match should be organized between the Cornhuskers and Great Britain with the winner taking ownership of #GBR. An American football match. “If they want to cobble together a football team and bring it over here, we can get this set up right now,” Knapple said. “We can take care of it. ” Joking aside, Knapple admitted that he’s an Anglophile at heart. “It’s a great country full of wonderful music and writing,” he said. “BBC TV is by far better than American television. ” Mosier, who has made a few trips to London in his lifetime, also expressed his love for all things British, particularly the tiny,    image he’ll have no choice but to see thousands of times in the coming weeks as he monitors Nebraska’s social media feed. “It’s Britain,” Mosier said. “It’s a   flag. ” Still, sporting allegiances die hard.  But that, too, was said mostly in fun. Two days earlier the Huskers account sent out some qualified support to its hashtag mate of the next few weeks.

Moonlight review – devastating drama is vital portrait of black gay masculinity in America
It’s been a particularly horrifying year for minority groups in America. The increasingly documented inhumanity towards African American men by police and the brutal act of homophobia that took mostly Hispanic lives at a gay club in Orlando have awakened many to the bleak knowledge that progress is stalling and instead, regressive views on race and sexuality are still dangerously pervasive. Stories of LGBT people of colour have been largely ignored in film or at least relegated to the sidelines while instead, we’re offered up the whitewashed history of Roland Emmerich’s tone deaf Stonewall or   Oscarbait like The Danish Girl. But, in a festival season that’s too often populated by quite literally vanilla awards fare,   Barry Jenkins’ astonishing new film is both proudly black and refreshingly queer. It’s a thrilling, deeply necessary work that opens up a   and rarely approached   conversation about the nature of gay masculinity. Based on the play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue by Tarell Alvin McCraney, the film follows the life of a man in three key stages. Initially, we meet    Chiron as he runs through the streets of Miami, chased by his peers. He attracts the attention of local drug dealer Jean (Mahershala Ali) who comes to his aid and with the help of his girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Monae) he gets him to open up as they take care of him at their home. It becomes a refuge for him, away from his mother Paula (Naomie Harris, giving her best performance since 28 Days Later) a nurse with a crack addiction, who alternates between overbearing affection and cruel neglect. Chiron is withdrawn and lonely, a target for the boys at school who seem to recognise something within him that’s still a secret to Chiron himself. In one, unforgettably wrenching scene, he asks Jean and Teresa what a faggot is and how he knows if he might be one. By the time we see Chiron in the second chapter, he’s a teenager who’s learned to survive by hiding his sexuality from those around him, slowly developing a tough exterior. But his true identity still haunts him, he cries so much he worries he might “turn into drops” and he remains a bullied and physically abused outcast. In the final stretch, Chiron is a man with a fully developed guard against the world, a toxic masculinity that’s led him down dark and dangerous alleys to avoid facing who he really is. Despite the difficult subject matter at hand, Jenkins avoids drowning us in despair. There’s a remarkably unexpected focus on the beauty that surrounds Chiron with moments of soaring wonder so perfectly aligned that there’s something almost Malickian about his marriage of lush music and dreamy imagery. It’s an entirely unique vision and wrongfoots us from the start. Similarly, the script avoids cliche and refuses to paint these characters as the stereotypes they’re so often presented as. Chiron’s surrogate father of sorts, played with exceptional deftness by Ali, confounds our worst Hollywoodised expectations. Rather than training Chiron to run drugs for him or grooming him in a predatory manner, he’s giving swimming lessons and telling him that his sexuality is nothing to be ashamed of. It’s yet more levity that helps the film from becoming unrelentingly grim. But Jenkins doesn’t pull any punches in showing the crushing loneliness and horrific violence of being a gay man in a culture where homosexuality is seen as a weakness. We see the visible and invisible scars that develop from a lack of acceptance and by the time we finally meet adult Chiron, played with incredible nuance by   Trevante Rhodes, he’s trapped by his own desire, regulating his behaviour to remove anything that could be seen as “gay”. The third act sees him return home to reunite with a school friend (an exceptional performance from Andre Holland) with whom he had his one sexual encounter with during his teenage years. There’s a thrilling,   chemistry in these scenes as we see Chiron’s performed toughness fade in the face of a love he’s so sorely needed throughout his tortured life. It’s beautifully choreographed and easily the most believably intimate gay pairing since Andrew Haigh’s Weekend. Every single aching glance is a poignant reminder of what Chiron has endured to get here. Moonlight is a profoundly moving film about growing up as a gay man in disguise, a difficult and damaging journey that’s realised with staggering care and delicacy and one that will resonate with anyone who has had to do the same. We’re starved of these narratives and Jenkins’ electrifying drama showcases why they are so hugely important, providing an audience with a rarely seen portrait of what it really means to be a black gay man in America today. It’s a stunning achievement.

If at first you don’t succeed: how Hillary Clinton came back from the brink
Radiant in white, Hillary Clinton greeted the cheering mob at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, most of whom had waited hours in the wilting June heat to see history made. Inside what used to be a giant greenhouse, fathers held up their daughters to catch a glimpse of the stage where, they fervently hoped, stood the first American woman to be elected president. There were plenty of   women who had worked as volunteers in Clinton’s unsuccessful 2008 presidential campaign, enjoying sweet vindication. “I’ve waited my whole life for this,” one told me. “I wouldn’t have missed it for the world. ” In her second quest for the Democratic nomination, Clinton has been much bolder in emphasizing her gender. Her entrance was preceded by a short film featuring the suffragettes, who won the right to vote in 1919, on the very day Clinton’s mother, Dorothy Rodham, had been born. “It may be hard to see tonight,” Clinton began her speech, “but we’re all standing under a glass ceiling right now. ” The line echoed a sadder day in 2008, when a vanquished Clinton endorsed Barack Obama. In defeat, she told her supporters: “Although we weren’t able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it’s got about 18 million cracks in it. ” She was warm and human, and many in the crowd were left musing, “If only she had been like that in the campaign. ” In the intervening eight years, Clinton replayed the mistakes of 2008: her many failings as a politician (the critique that she was too brittle and unemotional) the constant infighting between her staff the fact she misjudged the delegate math and the lack of a coherent strategy or message. One of her aides described the 2008 campaign to me as “totally dysfunctional” adding “it was often unclear who was actually in charge”. Perhaps the most dysfunctional moment came right before that   concession speech. Some of Clinton’s current advisers still talk about the melodrama that played out until almost dawn. It deserves a full recounting, because it explains much about what went wrong, and Clinton’s disciplined course correction for 2016. A battle royale over the concession speech dragged on for days, so long that one aide compared it to the cold   Strategic Arms Limitation talks. As in other fights, this one pitted her male strategists, including pollster Geoff Garin and Howard Wolfson, her bulldog of a communications director, against some of the women, including campaign manager Maggie Williams, brought in late to restore order and bring some humanity. Williams was a close friend of Clinton’s who had worked for her when she was first lady, and even earlier, when she was a young attorney at the Children’s Defense Fund. Bill Clinton, Hillary’s most trusted strategist, had his usual role as   . The main issues of contention were how heartily Clinton should endorse Obama, and how much of a focus there should be on her gender, something she had not emphasized in the campaign: her advisers were fearful that voters would see a female candidate as too soft, and question whether a woman could be entrusted with national security. A draft went back and forth between the two camps, leaving it uncertain whether the     line, contributed by staffer Jim Kennedy, would survive (the outcome supported by the women) or be killed (the outcome preferred by the men). But Clinton loved it and approved a draft that night. Enter her husband, who fancied himself as a good editor. He jumped in, made some changes and his draft went back to Clinton hours later. “What’s this?” an annoyed Hillary asked. Told that it came from her husband, she replied: “It’s my speech. ” It was important to Clinton that she directly address her female supporters, who had desperately wanted, for history’s sake, to see her nomination at the Democratic convention. So she and one of her speechwriters hammered out a final version. When she stood inside the marble, cavernous ballroom of the National Building Museum the next day, barely a mile east of the White House, she uttered the glass ceiling line and the crowd went wild. ••• I have watched Hillary Clinton in her various political roles since she became first lady of Arkansas in 1979. Back then, she was still Hillary Rodham and I was a freelance copywriter for a political consulting firm, one that created advertising for her husband’s first campaign for the governor’s office. When I became a political and legal reporter, I spoke to her every now and then on matters involving case law, and the status of women in the law. At the Wall Street Journal, I was an investigative reporter covering money and politics I was told by a senior White House staffer that Clinton took offense at an article I had written in 1992 about the “FOBs” the Friends of Bill, an impressive network of donors that the Clintons had built. Apparently, Bill liked the piece Hillary thought it made them look as if they were using their friends. When I left the Journal to do investigative work at the New York Times, I wrote articles that were critical of Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who led the investigation that triggered the unsuccessful drive to impeach Bill Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Nonetheless, when I held the most senior editing jobs at the Times, I was told by two of Clinton’s press aides, and by reporters who covered her, that she thought I was biased against her. She blamed me for the Times’ tough coverage of the Clinton Foundation, scrutinising the murky conflicts of interest as international donors and old contacts backed pet projects, as well as other stories, including one about her marriage that said Bill and Hillary’s schedules rarely put them in the same location. This history reflects Clinton’s wariness of the press (bordering on loathing) and what some friends describe as a streak of paranoia. She did not agree to an interview for this article, and while some of her closest allies agreed to be quoted, none would go on the record saying anything even mildly critical. I found the same dynamic back in 1992: people close to her feared banishment from Hillaryland if they talked to the press. This account is based on interviews done over the past months, and on my own observations from watching Clinton on the campaign trail, from Arkansas to now. When I met Clinton in 1978, she did not seem like a politician, especially compared with her exuberant husband, who was always running late and couldn’t stand to leave a hand unshaken. He was the most likable candidate I had ever met. She was smart, on point, and didn’t like to have her time wasted. She was considerably less warm, though I have since spent time around the charming, funny Hillary. Almost everyone around her today admires Clinton’s resilience, and tells me she has improved her political skills, up to a point but they also share her own assessment  —   that she will never be a political natural like her husband. ••• Rather than wallow in the mistakes of 2008, Clinton went to school on everything Barack Obama had done right, meeting and grilling some of his top strategists, including Jim Messina, who went on to deliver a second Obama win, and a UK general election victory for David Cameron. In September 2014, she had a long meeting at her home with David Plouffe, Obama’s campaign strategist, who told her she had to have a   data analytics team, a key advantage for Obama in 2008. In her second presidential campaign, there has been little infighting and no hesitation to stress gender (“Deal me in!” was her memorable reaction to Donald Trump accusing her of “playing the woman card”). She has taken more direct control, including the tactical decision to give her dogged rival Bernie Sanders almost everything he wants in order to unify the party. She has ignored the lingering criticism that she is a boring egghead, and instead embraced her policy wonk tendencies. While Trump has confounded with his superficial and often contradictory statements, Clinton has been prosecuting the argument that testing times demand a leader with grip and knowledge. “Doing policy is smart,” Richard Billmire, a longtime Republican consultant who is no fan of Clinton’s, told me. “She’s projecting the    thing well. ” She leans hard on her adviser Jake Sullivan, a former Rhodes scholar who served as her director of policy when she was secretary of state, and then as   Joe Biden’s chief of policy. Sullivan has long been her “  guy” and was a favorite to be national security adviser in a Hillary Clinton White House this is now complicated by the fact he sent some of the emails at the heart of the investigation into her use of a private server. On the 2016 trail, it was Clinton’s call to attack Trump early and hard. Her cogent diatribe against the Republican candidate’s ignorance of foreign policy in San Diego, right before the California primary, was by far her best speech this year, reflecting her comfort with portraying her opponent as dangerous for America. This time, no one is asking whether Clinton is tough enough. She has grown surer of her own judgment, a certainty that is both her greatest strength and weakness. Once Clinton has made up her mind, it is extremely difficult to change it. Dissent isn’t welcome, one former White House official told me he doesn’t think she would be a good president, because she “can’t stand hearing people say she’s wrong”. It’s not that she’s   (one of her criticisms of Trump) or uncollaborative (she was known for working well with Republicans in the Senate, and with generals at the Pentagon) she just knows that she’s right. ••• Right after the concession speech in 2008, Clinton left the Great Hall to meet and thank her staff. She began sending out   notes from an office she set up in downtown Washington DC. There, she focused on putting a dent in her campaign’s $22m debt. According to HRC, a book about this period by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, Clinton and her aides kept a master list of every major Democrat who had supported her, and those who had endorsed Obama. Missouri senator Claire McCaskill, in the Obama column, was marked down as the worst traitor of all for a nasty quip about Bill (she said publicly that she wouldn’t trust him around her daughter). Then came the call from Obama, within days of his election, to ask Clinton to be his secretary of state. “She did not make the decision to say yes easily,” a   aide recalled. “It was a hard transition to go to work for the man that beat her. ” Clinton said no the first two times. “She wanted Obama to grovel a bit,” another former White House aide told me. The third time Obama offered her the job, she accepted. Her main concern was her freedom to hire, and she brought over many members of Hillaryland, including former White House lawyer Cheryl Mills and former chief of staff Melanne Verveer. She also kept in touch with her aides, instructing them not to brood over how it ended. “There’s too much work to do,” she’d tell them. For the most part, Clinton and Obama had a cordial but somewhat distant relationship. A loyalty nut herself, Clinton was determined not to undermine the president. On a few occasions, she got annoyed at White House staff, especially when they tried to block her pick, Capricia Marshall, for an important state department post. Obama overruled them and approved the appointment. Still, Clinton planned to stay for only one Obama term. No one I interviewed said Clinton spoke to them about whether she planned to run again. She keeps her political cards very close and confides in few people about her career or her personal life. “I am not the type of person who routinely pours out her deepest feelings, even to my closest friends,” she wrote in her first book, Living History. “My mother is the same way. We have a tendency to keep our own counsel. ” Once she joined the Obama cabinet, Clinton talked little of politics at all. “She has a great ability to compartmentalize,” said a friend. If she confided in anyone besides her husband and daughter, several friends told me, it was her mother, who lived with her in Washington DC while she was secretary of state. The two enjoyed watching television together, especially Dancing With The Stars. Her mother’s death at 92, in 2011, hit Clinton hard, because Dorothy was the one who always reminded her of the importance of resilience. In one of her speeches, Clinton said: “I can still hear her saying, ‘Life’s not about what happens to you, it’s about what you do with what happens to you  —   so get back out there. ’” As secretary of state, Clinton’s poll numbers shot up. Rebecca Traister, author of Big Girls Don’t Cry, a fascinating study of sexism in the 2008 campaign, observed: “It was easier to embrace this woman in a state of diminished power, once she had lost the big prize. Her favorability ratings were above Obama’s. Gallup found her the most admired woman in America. ” Clinton became the most travelled secretary in history  —   almost 1m miles  —   as she tried to restore America’s international reputation following the Bush years, but the pace was exhausting, and constantly being on planes hurt her health. At the end of 2012, a stomach bug left her dehydrated and Clinton fainted the resulting concussion left her with vision problems for weeks. Her health recovered, and towards the end of her tenure at Foggy Bottom, as the state department is known, Madam Secretary purposely projected a hipper, funnier image, opening a Twitter profile that at the time said: “Wife, mom, lawyer, women  kids advocate, FLOTUS, US Senator, SecState, author, dog owner, hair icon, pantsuit aficionado, glass ceiling cracker, TBD  …    ” Clinton was enjoying the benefits of a more approachable image, although the events of those final months in post would cast a shadow all the way to election year. The deadly attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, in which the US ambasssador to Libya and three other Americans died, triggered many subsequent investigations and hearings, and led directly to the revelations about Clinton’s use of a private email server. An investigation into the mishandling of classified information ended earlier this month without charges, but there was a stinging rebuke from the head of the FBI, who called Clinton and her staff “extremely careless”. It was only after she left office in early 2013 that she started thinking seriously about another run. “She began meeting with important Democrats,” said one of her current staffers, people such as Bill’s former chief of staff John Podesta and Jim Messina. There had been other, earlier indicators: on the night of Obama’s   in November 2012, an exploratory political action committee was established, called Ready For Hillary, made up of strategists and close friends. Somewhat surprisingly, Senator McCaskill of Missouri  —   deemed treacherous in 2008  —   became its lead spokeswoman and one of the first lawmakers to endorse Clinton. She had been allowed   to Hillaryland despite her disloyalty, a rare occurrence indeed. ••• “Beaches and speeches. ” That was Clinton’s stock answer to people who badgered her about her plans in 2013. She insisted she hadn’t made a decision, a claim that left her loyalists and the press corps skeptical. In December 2013, she and her husband flew to Oscar de la Renta’s palatial home in Punta Cana, a swank area of the Dominican Republic where the couple went every year. That was the beach part. She signed on with the Harry Walker Agency, a   speakers’ bureau in Washington DC. A few of her advisers thought it was a bad idea to become a “buckraker” but she justified it, pointing out that her predecessor Colin Powell earned   fees for the same thing. Why should she have to be the exception? Clinton often bristles over what she views as an unfair, sexist double standard that requires her to be cleaner than Caesar’s wife. It’s a resentment that also fuels her natural tendency zealously to protect a zone of privacy. Clinton’s bent towards secrecy has repeatedly gotten her into political trouble. First, the early scandals, such as an investment in the Whitewater land deal in Arkansas, only really remembered by the most implacable   obsessives. Then there was her refusal to reveal billings for her clients at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock when Bill was Arkansas governor. She would not reveal the names of lobbyists and others who met with her when she was crafting the Clinton healthcare plan, known as Hillarycare, when asked by journalists or Republicans in Congress. Most recently, she has refused Bernie Sanders’ demands to release the text of her   speeches to Wall Street banks. Money is another area where Clinton can be  . One lifelong friend told me that Hillary is haunted by her time in Arkansas, when she was the breadwinner (her husband’s salary as governor was only $35, 000). After he unexpectedly lost a bid for   in 1980, the couple had to leave the governor’s mansion for a small, drab place. Although I don’t buy it, this friend said fear over sudden “poverty” explained her lust for the speaking fees, for which she and her husband have earned an astonishing $139m over the last eight years. The home they bought in Chappaqua, New York, after leaving the White House cost $1. 7m, while Whitehaven in Washington DC cost nearly $3m. Her description of being “dead broke” after they left the White House made her look out of touch. Clinton’s pledge to relax more and tend to her health left advisers such as Cheryl Mills and Maggie Williams free to tell her that she should simply retire from politics, at the top of her game, and enjoy time with her new granddaughter, Charlotte, who was born in September 2014. “She wanted a grandchild more than anything,” one of her close advisers told me. On the road in 2016, now 68 years old, Clinton has Skype calls with daughter Chelsea and her grandchildren (Chelsea gave birth to a son in June). Because Bill and Hillary used to Skype with Charlotte before the campaign, the toddler’s eyes sometimes wander off during the calls, looking for her grandad. Whatever temptation there was for a slower pace, however, has clashed with Clinton’s belief, bordering on missionary zeal, that she has been called to public service. (An early New York Times magazine profile of her in 1993 when she was first lady was headlined “Saint Hillary” and captured her faith in “a politics of virtue”.) James Carville, who masterminded Bill’s 1992 presidential campaign and starred in a documentary about it, The War Room, told me he was certain she would run again. So were many others. The lack of a strong rival (or so Clinton thought, until Sanders came along) made another bid enticing. So no one was terribly surprised when, on 12 April 2015, Clinton announced, via video, that she was running. The next month, surrounded by her family, she held a rally on Roosevelt Island in New York. At the end of May, Sanders launched his own bid, but was soon overshadowed by fevered speculation over whether Senator Elizabeth Warren, another liberal firebrand, might jump in.  Clinton focused on hiring her campaign staff. As well as the Obama campaign, she had spent a great deal of time studying another, her friend Terry McAuliffe’s successful bid in 2013 to be governor of Virginia  —   a win in a swing state where Republicans had held the governor’s mansion. Clinton hired many from McAuliffe’s team, selecting his campaign manager, Robby Mook, as her own. Mook, 36, is less showy than Bill Clinton’s Carville, or Obama’s Rahm Emanuel, but he is viewed as a talented tactician who understands data while still in his 20s, he helped orchestrate some primary wins for Clinton in 2008. Clinton hired Obama’s pollster Joel Benenson, and others who had worked against her in 2008. Gone were Clintonites such as Mark Penn, a controversial pollster whose private business interests became an issue in 2008. Mandy Grunwald, a talented   was one of the few longtime loyalists advising her. Very soon, she had a large paid staff that would balloon to more than 700 by the end of the primaries. (Trump, who claims to have mostly   his quest for the Republican nomination, has about 70.) When I visited Clinton’s Brooklyn headquarters in May, I was surprised to see how much younger her campaign aides were compared with the previous team. A poster of her in profile, looking like Joan of Arc on the 2008 trail, seemed to be everywhere. The campaign occupies two floors of an office building near the courts, and the most important advisers are among the few to have private offices: chairman John Podesta, known for his grip of issues (Obama brought Bill Clinton’s former chief of staff back into the White House to drive through his second term climate change agenda in the face of a recalcitrant Congress) Jake Sullivan, and communications chief, Jennifer Palmieri (also plucked from Obama’s White House operation). The rest of Clinton’s staff sits mostly in the open until recently, everyone was crammed on to one floor. ••• In 2008, Clinton was criticized for acting like “the anointed one” on her campaign. Cold water was splashed on that notion very early in the race, when she came in a rather pitiful third in the earliest caucus state, Iowa, behind Obama and John Edwards. The biggest lesson she learned, she often said, was that she must “organize, organize, organize”. But 2016’s huge early Bernie Sanders rallies, filled with younger voters, tipped off her aides that she faced another tough climb in mostly white states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, and later in the midwestern Rust Belt. Stylistically, Clinton was rusty. In the snows of New Hampshire in February, there was poignancy to Clinton’s losing effort. I watched her campaign her heart out in Manchester, in Dover and in smaller towns. She was trying hard to forge an emotional connection with the voters she met. A lifelong Methodist, she confided that she tries to read a piece of Scripture at dawn each day, emailed to her by a minister friend. In one televised debate, she was asked a philosophical question about how she retains some semblance of humanity while at the centre of the political fray. She quoted a line from a parable that she called her “lifeline”: “Practice the discipline of gratitude. ” In the appearances I witnessed, Clinton drew smaller crowds than Sanders, her events often held in   gymnasiums. I noticed that she was raising her voice louder and louder, something others falsely reported as screaming. She seemed to get louder when she wanted to energize her audiences, to get them to applaud and shout her name. At the packed Sanders events, the adoration came naturally. The wobbly start hurt. Clinton was especially stung by the rejection from some younger women who didn’t seem that excited about the prospect of electing the first female president. She had devoted so much of her life to championing the welfare of women and children, and was now openly brandishing her feminism it was hard for her to understand why young women were so stirred by the    Sanders. The Clinton playbook was to do the opposite of 2008. But a member of her communications staff conceded to me that there remains one unfortunate similarity: a lack of narrative or clear message that sums up why she is running for president and where she will take the country. In 1992, her husband, advised by Carville and George Stephanopoulos, ran on: “It’s the economy, stupid. ” Barack Obama, advised by David Axelrod, ran on “hope and change”. While Mook and Podesta are extremely able, they are not political gurus, and Clinton has struggled to articulate her vision in a handful of words. “We don’t have an Axelrod,” the aide told me. It’s unclear if anyone might yet be found to fill that gap. Of course, Clinton’s main adviser, her husband, thinks he is that person. Another campaign official told me that the two speak on the phone at least once a day. But Bill has been less visible than in 2008, when he marred the campaign (and his own reputation) by calling Obama’s message a “fairytale” and drew criticism for suggesting “white Americans” were turning away from his campaign. More recently, Bill inflamed the email controversy when it was reported that he had met the attorney general, Loretta Lynch, in an Arizona airport just days before a decision was made on whether to prosecute Hillary. Lynch was forced to say she would follow the recommendation of the prosecutors and FBI officials working on the investigation. According to the 2007 book Her Way, by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, the Clintons have what they call “a   pact” from their Yale law school days. They both expected to be elected president, even if that dream took decades to achieve. Connie Bruck, who wrote an insightful profile of Hillary Clinton in the New Yorker in 1994, had a   White House interview with Bill, where he gushed over what a great president his wife would make. The idea was dismissed at the time. It doesn’t seem   now. ••• Clinton’s best political moment this year was in San Diego, right before the California primary. Flanked by more than a dozen American flags, she looked very much the   . Her speech clearly outlined her foreign policy goals: a strong, confident America engaged with the world, “to keep our country safe and our economy growing”. But the speech will be remembered for her scrupulously factual and devastating recitation of Trump’s most ignorant and outrageous statements about global issues. “They’re not even really ideas,” she said, “just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and outright lies. This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes  —   because it’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin. ” The speech took 10 days to craft, with Clinton involved. When she read aloud the litany of Trump’s statements, she turned to her speechwriters and asked in mock disbelief, “Can he really have said all these things?” At subsequent California campaign events, every time she mentioned the San Diego speech, the crowd spontaneously erupted in applause and cheers. This time, she did not need to raise her voice. In New Hampshire earlier this month, after a tetchy campaign season, Sanders and Clinton finally joined forces as he endorsed her  —   they even hugged  —   speaking from a lectern decorated with a “Stronger Together” logo. On the trail, Sanders had questioned her judgment and fitness for office, but in endorsing Clinton, he called her a first lady who had broken precedent, a leader in the fight for universal healthcare, “a fierce advocate for the rights of our children” and declared her “one of the most intelligent people that we have ever met”. Thumping the lectern, he proclaimed: “Hillary Clinton would make an outstanding president, and I am proud to stand with her today. ” It wasn’t picked for this reason, but at Balboa Park, where Clinton spoke in San Diego, there is a large statue of a Mayan woman. That ancient culture records women among its most powerful leaders. Next week at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, it is finally Clinton’s turn, with two past presidents  —   her husband and Obama  —   appearing in service of her nomination as the party’s presidential candidate. She will tell Americans she is ready to lead and, in November, hopes finally to take a hammer to that last glass ceiling.

Jon Jones stripped of UFC title after one-year doping ban upheld
Jon Jones has been stripped of the UFC interim light heavyweight championship after an arbitration panel denied his appeal of a positive test and upheld a doping ban that will run through July. Widely considered the world’s best    fighter, Jones was pulled from a July bout against Daniel Cormier at UFC 200 shortly after news about the positive drug test. Jones claimed to have taken a   pill but ended up testing positive for two banned   agents. “Jon Jones has blown it in every way shape and form a guy with that much talent can blow it,” UFC president Dana White told ESPN. “Greatest talent ever and the biggest   ever. ” The    won the newly created interim title in April when he defeated Ovince St Preux at UFC 197.  The US   Agency, which handles UFC testing, declared Jones ineligible. He took the case to arbitration and that panel delivered the maximum   suspension, saying Jones’ “degree of fault verged on the reckless”. Jones is eligible again on 7 July 2017. UFC issued a statement saying it was aware of the   ban, which began on 6 July. “While the decision indicates no evidence of Jones’ intentional use of banned substances, it does highlight the care and diligence that is required by athletes competing in the UFC to ensure that no prohibited substances enter their system,” the UFC statement says.

Dominican woman jailed as a man in Miami prison files $5m lawsuit
A Dominican woman who says she was wrongly classified as a man and held with male inmates for 10 hours in a Miami prison has filed a US federal lawsuit alleging negligence and civil rights violations. The filing comes three years after Fiordaliza Pichardo was arrested at Miami’s international airport on what attorneys say was a   drug trafficking charge that was later dismissed. The $5m suit names the   corrections department as a defendant. Pichardo’s lawyers say she was initially booked as a female at the Metro West detention center but medical staff examined her and reclassified her as a man because they determined she had “  male characteristics”. Lawyers say Pichardo was then placed with 40 male inmates in an open cell where she was allegedly taunted and sexually harassed.   corrections spokeswoman Chandra Gavin said the department does not comment on pending litigation. Pichardo, who is married and has three children, was 50 years old at the time of the incident in November 2013. “She was humiliated,” attorney David Kubiliun told the Associated Press. “The officials acted with deliberate indifference by failing to protect her rights. ” Kubiliun said he did not know what the prison’s medical staff meant by “  male characteristics”. “We believe that those words were used as a   to their unlawful actions,” he said. “We are in the process of finding out what those motivations were. ” Pichardo is a former government official who was elected in 2010 as city council member in Bonao, a town north of the capital of Santo Domingo. Kubiliun said she traveled to Miami in 2013 for the birth of her third grandchild and had previously visited the United States without incident.

Walmart ordered to pay truck drivers $54m in minimum wage suit
Walmart intentionally failed to pay hundreds of truck drivers in California the minimum wage, a federal jury decided on Wednesday, awarding the drivers $54m in damages and opening up the retail giant to penalties. The seven jurors returned the verdict in a lawsuit accusing the company of not properly paying drivers in accordance with California law for activities that included inspecting and washing their trucks and for layovers. Civil penalties will be determined by a judge.  The company argued that the drivers were paid for activities that include those tasks and that they were not working during layovers. A lawyer for Walmart did not immediately return calls seeking comment on the verdict.  Attorneys for the more than 800 drivers who worked for Walmart between October 2005 and October 2015 were seeking $72m in damages, the bulk of it for layovers. They said during the trial that additional damages and penalties could push the total amount Walmart owed to more than $150m.    Walmart Stores Inc, the nation’s largest private employer, has faced other criticism over its pay and treatment of US employees.  The company announced last year that it was giving a raise to about a   US workers. The raises were part of a $1bn investment that the retailer said was also intended to give workers more opportunities to advance and more consistent schedules.  Walmart drivers are not paid by the hour. Wages are based on mileage and specified activities.  The drivers’ attorneys pointed to a ruling in their favor from US district judge Susan Illston, who said last year that Walmart would be in violation of California law if it enforced its driver pay manuals because they say no pay is earned for certain tasks.  “There’s nothing in any of those three manuals that covered 10 years of time that show the drivers were paid for any of these tasks that are on your verdict form,” attorney Butch Wagner said during closing arguments.  Drivers were also not paid minimum wage for layovers even though Walmart controlled their time by requiring them to stay with their trucks, the plaintiffs’ attorneys said.  The company argued that it paid drivers for activities that included other, smaller tasks and could not have a separate payment designation for everything they did, some of which took just minutes.  Walmart attorney Scott Edelman likened what the plaintiffs were asking for to a baker who charges a flat fee for a cake, not the individual tasks of buying the eggs, putting the cake in the oven or cleaning the dishes after.  “When you pay a baker $20 to bake a cake, what are you paying that baker to do?” Walmart attorney Scott Edelman said during his closing argument. “Is it just to put the cake in the oven for however long? Because that’s essentially what the plaintiffs are arguing. ”  Walmart pays drivers $42 for   overnight layovers as an extra benefit, but it does not control their time during that period, Edelman said. Drivers are free to go to the movies, exercise or do other activities, he said.  The company has said its drivers are among the   in the industry, with some making more than $100, 000 a year.

So what if Malia Obama wants to dance and Melania Trump once posed nude?
Stop the press. Hold the front page. An    girl likes to dance! If this doesn’t sound particularly newsworthy, it’s because it isn’t. Or, at least, it shouldn’t be. But when you are a young black woman and your father is the president of the United States, all the usual rules about privacy, respect and general common sense apparently disappear. So Malia Obama, who has shown extraordinary grace while growing up in the media spotlight, found herself plastered across the internet for the cardinal sin of dancing at a concert. Less than a month after her 18th birthday, as Malia hung out at a festival with friends, she gave the briefest of shimmies, which was immediately captured on video and translated into: “Malia Obama Caught on Video Twerking and Flashing the Crowd” and “President Obama’s daughter flashes her undies at a camera”. Taking the public shaming one step further, social media users were quick to complain that Malia’s trip to the Lollapalooza festival coincided with the Democratic national convention, a major event in the political calendar that, of course, as an unelected citizen, she had absolutely no responsibility to attend.  It wasn’t the first time that Obama’s daughters have experienced   public attacks. In 2014, Elizabeth Lauten, a spokesperson for a Republican congressman, resigned after comments she made on Facebook about Sasha and Malia Obama went viral. Criticising the girls for apparently not looking enthusiastic enough when they appeared alongside their father at a televised event, Lauten suggested they: “try showing a little class. At least respect the part you play. ” It was a casual occasion (the annual Thanksgiving turkey “pardon” ceremony) but Lauten castigated the Obama girls for wearing skirts she deemed too short, writing: “Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar. ”  Perhaps the most insidious aspect of these attacks is that the real target is never the “shamed” woman or girl, but the political man to whom they are related. Lauten’s true intent was revealed when her post continued: “Then again, your mother and father don’t respect their positions very much, or the nation for that matter   …     So I’m guessing you’re coming up a little short in the ‘good role model’ department. ” Her mean and inappropriate public derision of two teenage girls was a veil for the real mark: their political parents. This week, Melania Trump, wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald, was   in order to criticise her husband.   nude photographs of her were splashed across the front pages of the New York Post. Under the headline “Melania Trump’s    photos from racy shoot revealed” they reprinted a number of images from a 1995 photoshoot, which had featured in a   French magazine. To dig up ancient “racy” photographs of Trump’s wife adds absolutely nothing to the political conversation other than the heavy implication that such conduct is   of a first lady, and might therefore reflect poorly on Trump’s candidacy. Women whose fathers, brothers or husbands happen to have political careers are treated as mere appendages of their male relatives  —   to be judged, critiqued and shamed for the sole purpose of reflecting embarrassment back on to the male politician. Just consider the media treatment of Justine Miliband, who was torn down for not having a homely enough kitchen, or Samantha Cameron, who was eviscerated for wearing a sleeveless dress to a church service.  Malia and Sasha Obama have not only experienced this suffocating scrutiny throughout eight years of their childhood and teenage years, but have also endured horrifying racist abuse  —   from accusations that Malia only won her place at university because she is black, to commentators describing her with racial slurs online. The same kind of abuse has dogged Michelle Obama throughout two terms as first lady, most recently in a repugnant cartoon comparing her unfavourably to Melania Trump.  Of course, some public comment comes with the territory for adult women who choose to become involved in their husbands’ political careers. It was right that Melania Trump’s Republican convention speech was criticised for its plagiarism, for example, just as it is reasonable to discuss and critique any political speech made by Michelle Obama. But the criticism should focus on their politics and views. Neither racism,   nor moral policing have any place in the political arena. Nor should any such criticism focus on children who have made no attempt to step into the political spotlight. To tear down wives and daughters as if they are empty vessels of family honour is dangerous and demeaning. But it also distracts us from the real issues. Most political men offer ample opportunities for criticism, all by themselves.

Chris Evans quits BBC Top Gear after just one series
Chris Evans has quit Top Gear after just one series in charge of the BBC2 motoring show amid falling ratings, unrelenting newspaper criticism and a breakdown of his relationship with   Matt LeBlanc. The BBC is understood to be negotiating with former Friends star LeBlanc  —   thought to be keen to remain on the show  —   for a second series. Last month, it was reported LeBlanc threatened to quit if Evans did not go.  The BBC confirmed that it had “no plans to replace Chris” and that it did not expect to make any changes to the presenting  . However, it described rumours that LeBlanc had made an ultimatum as “categorically untrue”. In a surprise tweet announcing his departure, Evans said: “Gave it my best shot but sometimes that’s not enough. ” The audience for the Sunday night show has more than halved since Evans took over in May with Sunday’s night’s closing episode watched by just 1. 9m viewers, down from 4. 3m for the opening show. Before its relaunch, Evans told the Guardian he would be disappointed if the show had fewer than 5 million viewers. When it was presented by Jeremy Clarkson, the programme attracted 8m viewers at its height  —   notably in the wake of   Richard Hammond’s   highspeed crash  —   and always reached more than 2m.  BBC management was concerned about falling ratings for its most valuable show, which was worth an estimated £50m in worldwide sales before Clarkson left last year after assaulting a member of staff. The decision to leave was made by Evans, but one television executive said that Evans had “jumped before he was pushed”. With other broadcast commitments including hosting the Radio 2 breakfast show, Evans struggled with a barrage of newspaper stories alleging poor behaviour, most recently one alleging sexual harassment in the 1990s. The presenter could be questioned by officers from London’s Metropolitan police in the next few days. Evans has denied the claims and previously said the reports were a “ ” and that allegations of bullying were ridiculous. But Evans is understood to have buckled under the relentless onslaught of negative coverage. “Chris isn’t Jeremy Corbyn. He knows when it’s time to go,” said someone close to the show. “He now feels a real weight off his shoulders. ” LeBlanc, who, in contrast to Evans, has been widely praised for his onscreen performance, is understood to have told BBC bosses during negotiations over his contract that the partnership was not working. One source said LeBlanc disliked his  ’s behaviour on set, though the BBC would not confirm this. Reports that LeBlanc had vowed to leave the show unless Evans was sacked emerged eight days ago in the Sun, an almost constant critic of Evans over the past year. Describing Top Gear  —   which has been hit by a string of staff departures  —   as “ ” the newspaper reported that LeBlanc had “grown increasingly frustrated with his  ’s rudeness and frosty attitude towards the team”. Evans met Mark Linsey, the director of the BBC’s   production team, BBC Studios, last week to discuss the future. In a statement on Monday, Linsey pointed out that the show had been sold to 130 territories worldwide and said: “[Chris] firmly believes that the right people remain, on both the production team and presenting team, to take the show forward and make it the hit we want it to be. ” Evans is expected to receive just one third of his   fee to produce Top Gear, estimated at almost £6m for three years once all his other BBC commitments are included. He will not receive any payoff. Evans said: “I have never worked with a more committed and driven team than the team I have worked with over the last 12 months. I feel like my standing aside is the single best thing I can now do to help the cause. “I remain a huge fan of the show, always have been, always will be. I will continue to focus on my radio show and the allied events that it encompasses. ” Linseysaid: “Chris is stepping down from his duties on Top Gear. He says he gave it his best shot doing everything he could to make the show a success. “He firmly believes that the right people remain, on both the production team and presenting team, to take the show forward and make it the hit we want it to be. The new series has so far notched up over 30m views in the UK alone and has already been sold to 130 territories worldwide. ” The appointment of Evans was controversial from the start after he had repeatedly denied he had been approached to host the show following Clarkson’s departure after he assaulted a member of staff. The then BBC2 controller Kim Shillinglaw said Evans’s “knowledge of and passion for cars are   and combined with his sheer inventiveness and cheeky unpredictability, he is the perfect choice to take our   show into the future”. But Shillinglaw lost her job before the programme went on air, the first of a string of senior departures to hit the show. Most notably, executive producer and   Evans collaborator Lisa Clark left before Christmas, essentially leaving him in charge. The BBC made Clare Pizey responsible for the show in March, just two months before it aired to generally bad reviews. The Mail was scathing, described the revamp as “so bad you could practically hear the champagne corks popping at Amazon HQ”   a reference to Clarkson’s new car show. Andrew Billen in the Times picked on the lack of rapport between Evans and LeBlanc: “Chemistry was what we were looking for here, but their badinage was no more than passable offcuts from an unmade transatlantic buddy movie. ” As well as the lack of chemistry on and off screen, one source close to the show blamed a lack of preparation because of Evans’s “endless list of other commitments” such as Channel 4’s TFI Friday, the Radio 2 show and Children in Need. Evans hit back at tabloid claims of bullying that he was “out of control” as “nonsensical and facile and fictitious”. But the show also suffered a PR disaster when LeBlanc was filmed in a car with rally driver Ken Block doing “doughnuts” near the Cenotaph war memorial in London. Evans apologised “unreservedly” for the stunt and the scenes were never transmitted. The next series is already in   with filming set to start in September, without Evans.

Russia’s athletes escape blanket IOC ban for Rio Olympic Games
The International Olympic Committee faces an unprecedented backlash from   groups and athletes after it decided not to impose a blanket ban on the Russian team competing in next’s month’s Rio Games. Instead it ruled the 28 individual sports federations which make up the summer Olympics were free to decide the fate of Russians on a    basis. Dick Pound, the former World   Agency president who authored a damning report into   doping in Russia last November, claimed the IOC’s decision had revealed there “was zero tolerance for doping, unless it’s Russia”. “The IOC had a huge opportunity to make a statement. It’s been squandered,” he said. The   Institute of National   Organisations called the news “a sad day for clean sport‚” adding: “The IOC has ignored the calls of clean athletes, a multitude of athlete organisations, and of leading National   Organisations, to do the right thing by excluding Russia. ” Meanwhile, Great Britain’s Olympic long jump champion, Greg Rutherford, said the IOC’s decision to pass the buck to its individual federations was “a spineless attempt to appear as the nice guy to both sides”. “I had a terrible feeling that this would be the case, that pressure would be bowed to, that arms would be twisted,” he told the Guardian. “The IOC were presented with an opportunity here to make a clear and concise statement of intent that the Olympic movement is to be believed in, to be supported, championed and enjoyed. “Unfortunately what we’ve been given is the absolute worst of all worlds. ” The British javelin thrower Goldie Sayers, who looks set to be awarded a bronze medal from the 2008 Beijing Olympics after being beaten into fourth by a Russian whose sample from the event was recently found to be positive, was just as scathing. “The IOC is effectively saying it is OK to run a   doping programme,” she told the Guardian. “It goes against the value of the Olympic movement and everything that clean athletes believe in. ” The Canadian law professor Richard McLaren had also been damning in his report on doping in Russia last week. However, the IOC president, Thomas Bach, insisted it was important to respect the rights of individual athletes. When Bach was asked whether he would be happy to compete against Russians, he said: “I would feel absolutely comfortable and fine because the protection of clean athletes is what I have always fought for. An athlete should not suffer and be sanctioned for a system in which he was not implicated and where he can show that he was not implicated. I am really convinced of this decision and fine with it. ” Under the IOC’s ruling each federation will be required to produce a list of Russian athletes they believe are clean   which will be checked by an arbitrator from the IOC and court of arbitration for sport. Any Russian with a doping conviction will be automatically barred. Many were quick to point out the inconsistency in that ruling, given that other countries are able to send previously banned athletes. In a statement the IOC said each sport would be required to “carry out an individual analysis of each Russian athlete’s   record, taking into account only reliable, adequate international tests, and the specificities of the athlete’s sport and its rules, in order to ensure a level playing field. ” With less than two weeks before the Olympics start vetting more than 300 Russians will not be an easy task. Sayers warned of another problem. “When it comes to making decisions about which Russians to let in, there’s going to be a huge lack of consistency between governing bodies,” she said. “I just believe the IOC have passed the buck and not shown decisive leadership. ” Within hours of the decision the International Tennis Federation had cleared all seven Russian tennis players to compete at the Games. “The seven Russian tennis players who have been nominated to compete in Rio have been subject to a rigorous   testing programme outside Russia,” it said in a statement. “The ITF believes that this is sufficient to meet the relevant requirement of the IOC Executive Board. ” Other sports hope to follow suit. Last week Marius Vizer, the president of the International Judo Federation, said: “The presence of Russian athletes is very important as the Russian Judo Federation is a prominent member of the International Judo Federation, with Russian judo playing a great role in the history of sport. ” Fencing is another sport likely to admitmost Russian competitors. But the International Weightlifting Federation may be forced to issue a ban on Russian weightlifters because of the country’s large numbers of positive tests in that sport. The IOC decision comes after months of agonising in the corridors of international sport about how to deal with the cascade of revelations of   doping in Russia. Last month the IAAF, athletics’ governing body, banned all Russian track and field athletes from international competition unless they could prove they had been comprehensively tested outside the Russian system. Only two athletes, Darya Klishina, who trains in Miami, and the whistleblower Yuliya Stepanova were given permission to go to the Games if they competed under a neutral flag. However, in another controversial decision, the IOC decided against allowing Stepanova  —   whose revelations of widespread   doping were a vital part of the Pound report  —   to compete in Rio because it claimed its rules do not recognise neutral athletes and because she had previously doped. The United States   Agency slammed the IOC’s decision, calling it “incomprehensible” and adding that it would “undoubtedly deter whistleblowers in the future from coming forward”. It said the IOC’s decision not to act decisively over Russia was a “significant blow” to the rights of clean athletes. “The IOC believes   should be wholly independent, and that is in part why it is so frustrating that in this incredibly important moment, they would pass the baton to sports federations who may lack the adequate expertise or collective will to appropriately address the situation within the short window prior to the Games. The conflict of interest is glaring. ” The prominent sports lawyer Gregory Ioannidis warned the IOC’s decision to pass the buck would stretch the resources of international federations and Cas in the coming days and would lead to procedural chaos and legal uncertainty. “Bach is acting like a Pontius Pilate figure in all of this, putting the responsibility elsewhere and letting them decide,” he said.

Pride and Prejudice and Zombies author sued by publisher
Pride and Prejudice and Zombies author Seth   is being sued by his publisher for delivering a manuscript that Hachette claims is “an appropriation of a      work”.   who unleashed the zombie mashup on the world with the surprise 2009 hit Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, and went on to write the bestseller Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, is being taken to court by Hachette for breach of contract. The complaint, which was posted online by Publishers Marketplace, says that the author and publisher made a $4m (£3m) deal in 2010 for   to deliver two new works, with an initial instalment of $1m paid to the author.   delivered the first book, The Last American Vampire, a sequel to Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter that was published in January 2015. But according to Hachette, the deadline for delivery of the second was extended from June 2013 to April 2016. The complaint says the   delivered the second manuscript in June 2016, but alleges that the work was “not original to Smith, but instead is in large part an appropriation of a      work” that it “materially varies from the 000 word limit” agreed on, and that it “is not comparable in style and quality to Smith’s wholly original bestseller Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter”. That novel imagined the 16th US president as the nemesis of the forces of the undead during the civil war. Hachette is suing   and his company Baby Gorilla for at least $500, 000  —   half of the advance it paid him six years ago, plus interest  —   saying that “by delivering a manuscript that varied so materially and substantially from that described in the agreement” he is in breach of contract.

Student debt made the domestic violence against me worse
Amount of debt: $85, 000, Source of debt: College, Estimated time till debt free: Decades, Debt wasn’t something I could talk to my boyfriend about. In fact, there were many topics that were too dangerous to broach  —   that was just one of them. The red flags had been popping up all over the place. A healthy person doesn’t snap at someone for chewing too loudly or too fast. Getting your hand slapped for trying to show a funny YouTube clip isn’t normal. And being in debt shouldn’t result in bruises. But it did. The first time my   got violent, we were both graduate students living in Britain and had been together for less than a year. He violently shoved me and then acted like he didn’t mean it and that it couldn’t have hurt. Moments later he did it again. Nearly yanking my arm out of the socket, he threw me down the hallway.  I yelled at him that I would tell everyone, surely someone in the building had heard. He said it wasn’t a big deal and somehow convinced me that I had concocted the story in the midst of a panic attack. Being in this relationship was hard, and debt made it all the more difficult.  I had accrued over $85, 000 in debt over the course of six years. Around $5, 000 of that was credit card debt, and the rest was entirely education debt from undergraduate and graduate school. I had scholarships, but they barely scratched the surface of reducing the financial burden.  He was from Europe and didn’t have to pay a dime for his undergraduate degree. But I couldn’t talk about my debt because my boyfriend would berate me for going to college when I didn’t have the money to pay for it outright. He would yell and blame everything on me and my financial instability. That’s when I created filters to block emails from my student loans and credit cards, because my economic woes were too dangerous a topic to risk breaching. One of the worst fights broke out when I purchased tomatoes from a slightly more expensive store than the one he told me to go to. He stood in the doorway of the living room, repeating the same phrase over and over: “I pay your life! Why didn’t you learn the first or second time?”  I attempted to respond, but he barked at me to stop ranting and pulled me towards the kitchen. I tried to plant my feet and stand outside the door. I was crying out to leave me alone, to let me go, to just stop. Half of what I said was to him, begging him to stop, the other half was to myself, trying to wake myself from the nightmare, trying to convince myself that it wasn’t really happening. He grabbed my shoulders, to drag me closer. I struggled free. His hands left dark splotchy bruises up and down my arms. He shoved me violently against a closet door before disappearing into the kitchen. When he emerged, his demeanor was as if I was the one acting irrationally and he was there to calm me down. I landed a job at a prestigious university after working as a   childcare worker for several months. My new gig was also   but the pay was better and the future brighter. After my first day, I was brimming with excitement and had a reinvigorated sense of determination. It was a blistering cold evening so I decided to spend an additional $8 to take the train home. I was on the tail end of a nasty cold and didn’t want to make it worse with a long bumpy bus ride. When I got home, I let it slip that I took the train. He had given me $8 that morning to help me pay for my ride, and he gave me explicit instructions to not take the train home. He allowed me to take the train to work, because it was over an hour faster. The fury unleashed on me for misappropriating the money was horrific. “You bought expensive train tickets when you didn’t have to, then expected me to pay for your travel. ” “How stupid was I to help you?” “You repay my kindness by being selfish and you are blind to it. ” “Why do you have a degree? A lot of good that’s done you. ” “You are always miserable!” “Oh, great, you’re on another rant. ” “You’re just lazy and pathetic. ” Things were so bad that I downloaded an app to track my emotions. I encrypted journal entries and pictures of my bruises, locked behind a passcode. I stacked up evidence to fight my denial. The physical violence seemed to happen on a schedule, just enough bodily harm to keep me fearfully in check during the frequent emotional abuse. It took two years, but a day came when I had nothing left in me. I laid out the data and I could no longer convince myself that I was to blame for the flood. He was drowning me. I was fighting against a rip tide and couldn’t keep my head above water. I called my mom and asked for help. Without hesitation she said: “We will not let you sink. You are loved and you are coming home. ” Today, my debt continues to follow me. Talking about money problems can trigger terrifying flashbacks, but they lessen as time goes on. The fear of my debt feels like chump change compared to the fear I used to live in.

NAACP considers role alongside Black Lives Matter at annual convention
In its   history, few National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) conventions have arrived at as charged a moment as this.  After   police killings of black men in Baton Rouge and Minneapolis and two targeted killings of police officers, the US is being forced to stare down its perennial struggles with race and justice. So as 5, 000 NAACP members, volunteers and leaders descend on Cincinnati, Ohio, one natural question that presents itself is: where does the venerable association sit in relation to the relatively nascent Black Lives Matter movement that has captured the nation’s attention with its loud, urgent protests against police violence? On paper, it does not seem much of a question at all. Founded in 1909 by the black sociologist, author and activist WEB DuBois, along with several liberal white activists, the NAACP has had a hand in all of the nation’s major race issues since then. It was instrumental in the fight against lynching in the first half of the 20th century, and the battles against Jim Crow segregation that defined the 1950s and 60s. “In the last century it had to do with lynching, ropes and sheets,” NAACP president Cornell Brooks told the Guardian. “This century we’re grappling with a form of racialized violence called police misconduct having everything to do with badges and uniforms. ” This comparison is one Black Lives Matter activists commonly cite, and the BLM rallying cry has even been incorporated into the NAACP’s convention theme for 2016: “Our Lives Matter, Our Votes Count. ” But this apparent congruence obscures fault lines which run through the relationship between BLM and the NAACP. In the minds of many activists, the NAACP is decidedly   both in its approach and its values. To many in the   driven BLM movement the NAACP’s institutional credibility is its weakness, suggesting it is too married to the existing political system. The respect the association commands in corporate and political circles is to many activists a fatal kowtow to the politics of “respectability” which stifles the dynamic range of blackness that exists. While the NAACP rarely directs critiques at younger activists, the points of divergence are clear. “We don’t hyperventilate in the streets,” Brooks said. “We have a clear, cogent message that we often lift up bodily with our presence in our streets, but we lift up that same message strategically and thoughtfully in state and federal legislatures. ” Brooks continued: “What we say to this woke generation is that you gotta be conscious and aware of not just the power of shutting things down, but also opening things up. ”  Citing voter suppression legislation introduced throughout the country, designed to make voting more difficult, he added: “And we say to millennials that your power is so important, that there is a well orchestrated plan to make sure you don’t vote. ”  Often, NAACP members and leaders frame their efforts as the real world actuation of BLM’s justifiable outrage. Carlton Mayers, policy counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund’s Policing Reform Campaign, said activists making noise is critical to keep national attention on issues of racial injustice.  “You also need to have the people who are in the backdrop litigating these cases before the courts,” Mayers said. “They are the ones who are going to work to enact the policies that are needed to keep law enforcement accountable. ”  He pointed to the LDF’s sustained work in New York City, Baltimore, Charleston and Ferguson, all locations of   police killings, as examples. As Brooks put it: “We’re there before the cameras arrive and we’re there long after they leave. ” One of the major differences between the Black Lives Matter movement and the NAACP is generational. The NAACP skews much older. But with 30, 000 youth and college members on its rolls, its younger members have an increasingly strong voice. If they have a say, the melding of BLM and NAACP may come before long. “We keep the association honest and we keep them true to its mission and values,” said Stephen Green, national director of the NAACP Youth and College Division. Green is no stranger to BLM style direct action and believes wholeheartedly in its efficacy, but also in the NAACP’s   strategy. “We need to be engaged in the streets, we need to continue to resist. We need to continue to block bridges and disrupt highways,” Green said. “But also focus our agenda on the polls. Registering voters and disrupting the status quo is what i think our mission should be until [election day]. ” Green said that when he was in college, he became so frustrated with the NAACP that he nearly left with a mind to start a new organization. A former chairman convinced him otherwise.  “We have an association and it’s a democracy  —   just take over it, run it,” then chairman Julian Bond said to Green, an argument he found convincing.  “There is something to be said for those five letters that have been a framework and a groundwork,” he said. Unlike the diffuse Black Lives Matter, the NAACP has a rigid and traditional governing structure. The convention brings together thousands of voting delegates every year, much like a political party. They decide priorities and positions. “Black Lives Matter” also serves as a general slogan and rallying cry for people of all affiliations sympathetic to the cause of reducing racialized police violence, further complicating the question of leadership and structure. In the NAACP, the delegates and the leaders they elect, decide the mission and the tone. Green says there is a push from younger members to direct the association towards the ground BLM has staked. But he doesn’t see the two worlds as so far apart either. “There’s no difference between the BLM movement and the NAACP,” he said. “They may have a different vehicle but we’re all going in the same direction and I think that’s the key, that we’re all here fighting for democracy. ” The Cincinnati NAACP convention kicked off the same week that the Republican national convention began it’s coronation of Donald Trump across the state in Cleveland. Trump, whose campaign has been widely decried as racist, refused an invitation to speak to the nation’s oldest civil rights organization, just the third time a Republican nominee has spurned the group in the last nine presidential elections. Bob Dole in 1996 and George W Bush in 2004 also did not speak. The Democratic presumptive nominee, Hillary Clinton, was scheduled to address the convention on Monday. Her remarks were expected to touch on police violence, the Baton Rouge shooting that left thee officers dead on Sunday and voter registration.

Protest and prayer: Donald Trump visits black church in Detroit
Donald Trump’s visit to a black church in Detroit met with disgust among protesters and activists on Saturday, but won praise from parishioners who attended the service at the Great Faith Ministries church on the city’s west side. A sea of protesters and a heavy police presence surrounded the church, as local residents along Grand River Avenue looked on. Chants of “No Trump, go home Trump” were raised by about 75 people in a march organized by local pastors and activists. The visit by the Republican presidential nominee came just two weeks after a speech to business tycoons in downtown Detroit was nearly derailed by activists who continually interrupted him.  Tony Minetee, who grew up near the church, called the scene on Saturday a “circus”. “Trump is an idiot, and he’s pandering,” said Minetee, 48. After months of harsh campaign rhetoric from the former reality TV star, Minetee said his effort to court the African American vote was almost incredible. “You can’t just talk to people like that and think it’s going to just smooth over,” he said. Rick McGowan, 62, carried a sign with a caricature of Trump that deemed him “unstable in all his ways”. “I disagree with Donald Trump on everything that he says,” he said. The Trump campaign would not allow the Guardian inside the church, as different aides said it was a “closed event” or said no press would be permitted at all. Events inside the church were, however, broadcast on television. As the service began, shortly after 11am, Trump shook hands with members of the congregation, then took a seat in the church’s front row, swaying back and forth to music.  To mild applause, Bishop Wayne T Jackson noted that the Republican nominee was in the crowd. “This is his first African American church he’s been in, y’all,” said Jackson, laughing and noting that the service would be a “little different” to those of the Presbyterian church to which Trump is accustomed. After Jackson spoke about the need for love and called on parishioners to hug and love each other, Trump could be seen hugging and greeting churchgoers himself. He posed for selfies and held up a baby. Trump had not been expected to address the congregation, having sat beforehand for a privately taped interview with Jackson that was due to be edited and published later on Saturday. In the event, he said he would read some remarks he had written several days earlier. Trump is not known for his strong Christianity: asked last year at an evangelical event in Iowa if he had ever sought God’s forgiveness, he said that he had not. Accordingly, he has struggled among white evangelical voters. In Detroit, his speech was heavily focused on faith and the importance of black churches through US history. Reading from a script and adopting a milder tone than that familiar from campaign rallies and debates, the billionaire businessman said: “We’re all brothers and sisters and we’re all created by the same God. We must love each other and support each other and we’re in this all together. “I fully understand that the African American community is suffering from discrimination and there are many wrongs that must still be made right. They will be made right. I want to make them right. “It’s from the pews and pulpits [and] Christian teachings of black churches all across this land that the civil rights movement lifted up its soul and lifted up the soul of our nation.  “There is perhaps no action our leaders can take that would do more to heal our country and support our people than to provide a greater platform to the black churches and churchgoers. ” Trump also noted that the Republican party was the party of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president, who defeated the   Confederacy in the civil war and signed the emancipation proclamation. “Becoming the nominee of the party of Abe Lincoln has been the greatest honor of my life,” said Trump. “It is on his legacy that I hope to build the future of the party, but more importantly the future of the nation. ” Trump did not focus on crime and law and order, as he has done when speaking to white audiences, or touch on police violence against the black community, gun violence or mass incarceration  —   major African American issues that the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, has discussed on the campaign trail. Instead, he focused on jobs. “I’m here today to learn so that we can together remedy injustice in any form and so that we can remedy economics so that the African American community can benefit economically through jobs and income and many different ways,” he said. Outside, protests continued. A group of clergy from across metropolitan Detroit denounced Trump’s visit. The Rev Lawrence Glass said Trump’s message to the black community and minorities  —   asking “what do you have to lose” through a vote for the Republican  —   was not genuine. “What do we have to lose?” Glass said. “How about voting rights, civil rights, human rights?”  The mayor of Detroit, Mike Duggan, also criticised Trump’s decision to speak in his city and attacked the businessman on economic lines. At a press conference, in a restatement of remarks at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July, Duggan said: “The difference between Donald Trump and Detroit is Detroit’s only gone through bankruptcy once. ”  The city is attempting to leave behind the largest municipal bankruptcy in US history. In his speech to the Detroit Economic Club last month, Trump sought to use the city as an illustration of Democratic party policies that he said produced “silenced victims”. Duggan noted key improvements, particularly falling rates of homicide and unemployment.  Detroit’s police chief, James Craig, told reporters at the church he had spoken to Trump for about 30 seconds, and said the Republican nominee told him: “Thanks for making us safe. ” As of 11. 45am no arrests had been made, Craig said. Activists claimed a woman’s shoulder was broken by a police officer during a brief confrontation prior to the service. When events inside the church were over, attendees said Trump had received a warm welcome. Frank Bailey, 69, had driven in from Farmington Hills, a suburb about 20 miles   of the city. He said he enjoyed the service, having been concerned about how Trump would be received, due to his low polling among African Americans. “I think at the beginning [of the service] it was slow, but the more he talks and the more he said and the more genuine he seemed to become, I guess, I felt that they really warmed up to him,” he said.  Jacquelyn Rhodes, a pastor at New Light Christian Ministries in Detroit, said Trump offered substantive remarks. A lifelong independent, Rhodes said the visit had bolstered her support for the Republican.  “He wasn’t my first choice during the primaries,” Rhodes said, “but I do support Donald Trump. I think he will have a plan for jobs. I think that’s what we need most of all in the city of Detroit. The economy needs to be improved, and the city has been run by mostly Democrats over the years, and I feel that the policies that have been enacted have not helped the residents in the city. ” Others were not swayed. Cynthia Price, a Detroit resident, said that as a Christian she was “supposed to receive everybody in love  —   whether we agree with them or not” adding: “I mean, nobody had any animosity toward him, because we’re all Christians. ”  Still, Trump’s comments had not moved her much. “For voting for him?” she said. “No. I’ve never been a Republican  —   that’s probably a poor excuse  —   but I haven’t decided who I’m voting for. ” Latonya White, another Detroit resident, said Trump’s cool demeanor before the congregation had “shocked” her. She had no plans to vote for him either.  “I was expecting to hear his view on what’s going on in the black community and I was open to hear what he had to say,” White told reporters. “And some of the things that he did say, as far as just coming out in the black community, kind of shocked me, I’m gonna be honest. “It didn’t change my mind, but it did give me an open mindset concerning Donald Trump. ” The organisation of the event was somewhat chaotic. The service was publicized as open to the public on a     basis, but upon arrival some parishioners found that tickets were needed. On Wednesday, the New York Times obtained a copy of scripted answers for Trump’s taped interview Bishop Jackson, prompting Jackson to say he would change his questions.  Duggan, a Democrat, said Trump’s decision to use scripted answers contrasted with his customary portrayal of himself as a maverick. The mayor highlighted one question Jackson intended to ask  —   “Are you a Christian and do you believe the Bible is an inspired word of God?”  —   and said: “Donald Trump can’t answer that question to a minister without going through scriptwriters and consultants. “This is the most phony major party candidate I’ve seen in my lifetime. ” After Trump’s address, Jackson presented him with a Jewish Heritage Study Bible, a prayer shawl and a pin. Wrapping Trump in the shawl, Jackson said it was from Israel and added that he had prayed and fasted over it. Thanking the presidential candidate for his speech, Jackson declared that he had another title for Trump: “Preacher. ”

’Sanctions won’t stop our space race’: North Korea sets sights on the moon
North Korean space officials say they are hard at work on a   plan to launch more advanced satellites into orbit by 2020. But they don’t intend to stop there: they’re also apparently aiming to plant a flag on the moon. A senior official at North Korea’s version of Nasa said that he hopes to see the DPRK’s flag in space “within 10 years”. “Even though the US and its allies try to block our space development, our aerospace scientists will conquer space,” said Hyon   director of the scientific research department of North Korea’s National Aerospace Development Administration. According to experts, an unmanned North Korean moon mission isn’t that  . While the US is the only country to have conducted manned lunar missions, other countries have sent up unmanned spacecraft, and have in that sense “planted” their flags. Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist and expert on international satellites and satellite launches, said “it would be a significant increase in technology, not one that is beyond them. ”  Hyon said the current   plan, drawn up at the behest of the leader Kim   focuses on launching more Earth observation satellites and its first geostationary communications satellite which, technologically, would be a major step forward. He said universities are also expanding programmes to train rocket scientists. “All of this work will be the basis for the flight to the moon,” Hyon said, adding that he would like to see that happen “within 10 years”. North Korea has marked a number of successes in its space programme and its development of incresingly sophisticated   missiles for military use.  On Wednesday, it   what was believed to be a   ballistic missile into the seas off Japan, the fourth reported weapons launch in two weeks. It launched its latest satellite the Kwangmyongsong 4, or Brilliant Star 4 into orbit in February, just one month after conducting what it claims was its first successful hydrogen bomb test. The launches brought new international sanctions as nuclear tests and rocket launches, which can have military applications, are banned under United Nations resolutions. Hyon branded the sanctions as “ridiculous” adding: “Our country has started to accomplish our plan and we have started to gain a lot of successes. No matter what anyone thinks, our country will launch more satellites. ” He claimed that North Korea’s   target is to use its satellites to provide data for crop and forestry assessments and improved communications.  The US made its first lunar flyby in 1959, only six months after its first satellite, Explorer 1, though it took eight more years and several failed attempts to succeed with a lunar orbiter. The USSR made its first moon shot after only three successful Sputnik satellites. Its probe just a year and a half after Sputnik 1 reached the moon, but missed its orbit. “So it’s not ridiculous to attempt a moon mission early in your space programme,” McDowell said. “Given their low flight rate of one mission every few years, I think it is hard to see them succeeding in this in the next five years, but possible to see them attempting it,” he added. North Korea currently has two satellites in orbit,    and  . It put its first satellite in orbit in 2012, a feat few other countries have achieved. Its sworn enemy, South Korea, has yet to do so. Hyon said that as of 27 July    had completed 2, 513 orbits, and that within one day after its launch it transmitted 700 photographic images back to Earth. He said it is still working properly and sending data whenever it passes over North Korea, which is four times a day. Foreign experts have yet to confirm any communications from the satellite. “There’s been no independent evidence that   sent data back, but no evidence that it didn’t, either,” McDowell said. German analyst Markus Schiller, an expert on North Korea’s missiles and rockets, said a geostationary satellite might be a more ambitious goal for the country than a lunar flyby or  . “Hitting the moon hard would require less performance power, rocket size than getting into GEO [geostationary equatorial orbit] but it will still be quite a challenge,” he said. “Judging from what I have seen so far with their space programme, it will take North Korea about a decade or more to get to lunar orbit at best if they really pursue this mission,” he said. “My personal guess, however, is that they might try but they will fail, and we will not see a successful North Korea lunar orbiter for at least two decades, if ever. ” Hyon said claims that North Korea’s space plan is a military programme in disguise are hypocritical, considering the history of space exploration. The US Russia and China all built their space programs out of military technology. “It is the US that militarised space,” he said.

Archaeologists identify oldest Muslim graves ever found in Europe
Archaeologists working in southern France have identified three graves that are believed to represent the oldest Muslim burials ever found in Europe, dating to the eighth century. The skeletons at medieval site at Nîmes were found facing Mecca, and a genetic analysis showed their paternal lineage was North African, said the study in the journal Plos One. Furthermore, radiocarbon dating shows the bones likely date from the seventh to ninth centuries, suggesting they came from the Muslim conquests of Europe during that period. “Given all of these data, we propose that the skeletons from the Nîmes burials belonged to Berbers integrated into the Umayyad army during the Arab expansion in North Africa,” said the study. The findings add a new dimension to knowledge about the era, which had been limited to history books and rare bits of archeological data. “We knew that Muslims came to France in the eighth century but until now we did not have any material evidence of their passage,” Yves Gleize, an anthropologist with the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research and lead author of the study, told AFP. The graves were first discovered in 2006 near a major roadway in Nîmes as construction workers were digging an underground parking garage. A careful analysis in the years since has shown that the men were all laid on their sides, facing in the direction of Mecca, according to traditional Muslim burial rites. One was in his 20s when he died, another in his 30s and the third was older than 50. Their bones showed no sign of injury in combat. Another Muslim grave site has been found in Marseimulle, but it dates to the 13th century. One found in Montpellier may date to the 12th century.

Britain allowed its populist right to rise. America should heed the warning
Donald Trump landed in Scotland on Friday in a typically confused state of mind. Not because he was promoting his private business instead of, you know, running for president. But because  —   God bless him  —   he couldn’t figure out what just happened. It turns out that foreign affairs can be even more complicated than running a golf course. “Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote,” he tweeted. “They took their country back, just like we will take America back. No games!” If he had any aides or policy advisers, beyond his own brain watching cable news, someone might have told him that Scotland voted decisively to stay inside the European Union. And that Scotland will likely now vote to leave the United Kingdom and   the EU on its own. Such things might matter to an international businessman running a company in a foreign country. Or to a wannabe leader of the free world. But Trump told reporters on Friday that he wasn’t traveling with foreign policy aides because “there’s nothing to talk about”. That should calm the markets, if nothing else does. For the last few months, the snooty Brits have rather enjoyed the reality TV show known as the 2016 elections. It has been quite entertaining  —   although at times a little unsettling  —   to wonder if the American voter was truly reckless enough to nominate a strangely coiffed carnival barker with a casual disregard for the facts, running on a xenophobic and incoherent platform. Now the UK has voted to leave the European Union after a campaign led by their own strangely coiffed carnival barker with a similar hostility to the facts and to foreigners. But before Americans begin to chuckle at Boris Johnson and Britain’s   they should try to learn the lessons of what just happened in the old country. Otherwise they will be preparing for a Trump inaugural parade that rolls past a new Trump hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in seven short months. First, the rise of charismatic,   leaders can only happen when the weak leaders of the   surrender to them. This is what happened to the British Tories as they struggled through two decades of a rising and rebellious   faction. We’ve been watching the Republican party do the same with the emerging Tea Partiers and Trumpers over the same period. In London, Conservative leaders tried to   extremists instead of pushing their   Euro rebels to join the UK Independence Party. David Cameron’s   promise to hold an EU referendum was a colossal miscalculation designed to appease his own extremists. That   tactic led his own country to economic crisis and ended his career. In Washington, congressional Republicans thought the Tea Party’s   and   spirit was fine to ignore as long they helped undermine President Obama. Instead of ejecting them to join a third party, they embraced them, including their conspiracy theories about the president’s birth and religion. Now, after alternately ignoring and ridiculing Trump, they are shocked that the leader of the birther conspiracy is their nominee. The GOP’s   appeasement has imperiled its own future. This weakness was summed up with more graphic eloquence by Sir Nicholas Soames, a senior Conservative MP and the grandson of Winston Churchill, who knew a thing or two about appeasement. “If you have an Alsatian sitting in front of you, and it growls at you and bares its teeth, there are two ways of dealing with it,” he told the ConservativeHome website. “You can pat it on the head, in which case it’ll bite you. Or you can kick it really hard in the balls, in which case it’ll run away. ” Conservative leaders on both sides of the Atlantic have lacked the courage to kick anyone in the balls. Except, perhaps, themselves. The second lesson is about the siren call of nationalism. In an age of fractured media and financial crisis, it is refreshingly simple to attract a hard core of passionate voters with a nationalist message. Nationalism is a unifying force that exploits the resentment of economic and demographic upheaval. It is much easier to blame shadowy foreign powers and immigrants than it is to help older workers adapt to new skills in new industries. But the forces of nationalism, once unleashed, are not easily contained. David Cameron’s response to a Scottish independence vote was to stoke his own nationalism with a policy of “English votes for English laws”. Less than a year later, English nationalism destroyed his hold on power. The   nativism among the conservative base of the Republican party is no less mortal a threat to the GOP. After pandering to the   and   crowd for years, Republican leaders are now rightly fretting they will lose an entire generation of Latino voters. Like Cameron, they only have themselves to blame. The third lesson is a generational one. British voters under 34 were overwhelmingly supportive of staying inside the EU, but they were also the least likely to vote. That poor turnout meant the economic fate of millennials was decided by their parents and grandparents. Like his nationalist friends in England, Trump draws his electoral strength from older, whiter voters. To date, Hillary Clinton has underwhelmed younger voters who were drawn to the radical promises of her socialist rival, Bernie Sanders. Clinton cannot stop Trump without turning out younger voters in ways the Remain campaign failed to do in England and Wales. The fourth lesson is that voters don’t seem to care about the hypocrisy and inconsistency of the   politicians. Never mind that   politicians were railing against the elites and the EU. Never mind that Trump loves outsourcing and immigrant labor in his struggling businesses, while campaigning against, um, outsourcing businesses and immigrant labor. The sense of betrayal by and distrust of the elites is so rampant, it doesn’t matter who says it. “I think people in this country have had enough of experts,” said Michael Gove, the   justice secretary, who also compared   economists to Nazi scientists. The final lesson is that protest votes are not, in fact, a token gesture. They have a very real impact in the real world. For the next two years, as the UK negotiates its departure from the EU  —   and Scotland’s likely breakup from England  —   the protest voters will come to understand that the experts’ warnings of jobs leaving for Europe were real. Those warnings are also true across the Atlantic. If the US wants to end its status as the world’s only true superpower, it should close its borders to a billion Muslims, launch a trade war with China, build a giant wall to keep out Mexicans, and kick out 11 million residents. It won’t make America great, but it will be one hell of a protest.

Canada military survey finds 960 victims of sexual assault in a year
About 960 members of the Canadian military reported being victims of sexual assault in the past year, and 27% of women in the armed forces have been sexually assaulted during their career, according to the country’s national statistics agency.  The landmark survey, commissioned by the military, found 1. 7% of regular force members of the military had been sexually assaulted in the past 12 months, nearly double the 0. 9% rate of sexual assault among working Canadians. According to the Statistics Canada survey, which was released on Monday, 840 military members reported unwanted sexual touching, 150 reported sexual attack, and 110 sexual activity without consent in the 12 months before the survey was conducted.  The survey, which received more than 43, 000 responses and a 61% response rate among regular force members, found that women were four times more likely than men to report being sexually assaulted in the past year.  Women make up about 15% of Canada’s armed forces.  The chief of defence staff, Gen Jonathan Vance, said the results of the survey were both expected and sobering.  “Harmful sexual behaviour is a real problem in our institution. We know it, and we are trying to tackle it head on,” Vance told a news conference.  “I’m more motivated than ever to eliminate this behaviour and the perpetrators from our ranks. ”  Vance launched Operation Honour, a military programme to address sexual offences, in 2015 after an external investigation said the Canadian armed forces had an underlying sexualised culture hostile to women and gays. Western militaries are increasingly coming under scrutiny for their handling of sexual offences. A Pentagon report in May said sexual assaults in the US military are still underreported.  The Canadian survey showed female victims were far more likely to be sexually assaulted by someone in authority, with 49% of women assaulted in the past 12 months identifying a supervisor or someone in a higher rank as the perpetrator. In contrast, 56% of male victims identified a peer as the perpetrator, the report showed.  Eight in 10 respondents reported seeing or hearing inappropriate sexual or discriminatory behaviour, including jokes, unwanted comments, sexually explicit material being shared or displayed, insults, or pressure for dates or relationships, the report found.

Brexit vote puts Britain’s rising competitiveness at risk, says WEF
Britain’s sharp rise up the league table for global competitiveness to its highest place in a decade risks being reversed by the vote for Brexit, according to the World Economic Forum. The body that runs the annual Davos event said Britain had risen three places in the past year to rank seventh, but said the analysis for its Global Competitiveness report had used data collected before the 23 June referendum. Noting that the UK was currently one of the most competitive economies in the world, the WEF said: “Although the process and the conditions of Brexit are still unknown, it is likely to have a negative impact on the United Kingdom’s competitiveness through goods and financial markets as well as market size and, potentially, innovation”. The WEF study chimes with reports from other global institutions   including the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development   which said ahead of the referendum that Brexit would have a   impact on the UK in terms of weaker inward investment and less trade. The studies have been challenged by Brexit supporters, who say the UK will be able to forge closer trade links with countries outside the EU and will benefit from a reduction in the red tape generated in Brussels. The WEF’s report is published at a time when the government is mulling over its exit strategy from the EU. Some ministers favour a soft Brexit under which the UK would prioritise access to the single market, while others back a hard Brexit that would make immigration control the priority in negotiations. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: “Today’s report demonstrates our ability to sharpen our edge and improve our competitiveness. This government will build on that progress, as we demonstrate to the world that Britain continues to be highly competitive and open for business. ”  Speaking at the World Trade Organisation in Geneva on Tuesday, the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, said the UK would push for more trade liberalisation after Brexit. “The decision of the British people to leave the EU is not symptomatic of looking inwards, but a people who want to take more control over our laws, our money and our borders,” Fox said. “We are a proud and   trading nation. ” The WEF said the UK’s competitiveness relied on highly efficient goods and labour markets, in which it ranked 9th and 5th respectively out of the 138 countries assessed. The UK was third for technological readiness and scored more highly than the EU as a whole in11 of the 12 categories covered. Britain scored less well than the EU for its   environment, largely because of its large budget deficit, high debt ratio and weak performance in savings. Despite a rise of 23 places in the category, the UK still ranks only 85th in the world.  The three top countries in the league table  —   Switzerland, Singapore and the US  —   remain unchanged from 2015, with the rest of the top 10 made up of the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, the UK, Japan, Hong Kong and Finland. European countries made up half of the top 10, but the WEF said there was a marked divide between the north and south of the continent. Spain was up one place to 32nd, Italy dropped a spot to 44th and Greece dropped five places to 86th. France, the second biggest country in eurozone rose one position to 21st. “For all economies in Europe, maintaining and improving prosperity levels will depend heavily on their ability to harness innovation and the talents of their workforces” the WEF said. The report also noted an increase in both the developed and developing world in   barriers to trade, more burdensome customs procedures and tighter rules affecting both foreign direct investment and foreign ownership. The trend was most evident in high and upper   countries. Klaus Schwab, the WEF’s founder and executive chairman, said: “Declining openness in the global economy is harming competitiveness and making it harder for leaders to drive sustainable, inclusive growth. ”

South Koreans flock to remote northern area to play Pokémon Go
South Korean Pokémon Go players have been forced to leave their home towns and flock to a remote city close to the North Korean border in order to play because of the country’s mapping restrictions. As a   game augmented reality game, Pokémon Go relies on data from Google Maps to function, but South Korean security restrictions on mapping data have blocked Google from providing map features across a significant proportion of the country, including realtime information, 3D maps, personal transport directions and indoor maps. “Due to government restrictions on maps data, it’s impossible for Pokémon Go to work properly using Google Maps service in South Korea,” a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. Local map providers use   maps that have sensitive areas excluded, but a law that prevents export of   mapping data stops Google from using it, despite having been seeking a license for the data since 2008. Google recently publicly challenged the law. However, a city close to the border with North Korea, called Sokcho, has not been classified as a South Korean territory and therefore has the mapping data required to make Pokémon Go function. One user posted on an internet message board: “I didn’t go to some big tourist attraction all I did was walk around for tens of kilometres to play a game. But I’m more satisfied with this than any other trip. I would still be in Sokcho had it not been for an urgent issue. ” Bus tickets from the capital, Seoul, to the city have sold out, according to reports.  Sokcho, which sits on the eastern coast adjacent to the Seoraksan National Park, has been quick to capitalise on its unusual status, sharing maps of free   areas and advertising itself on social media as “the only Pokémon Go holy land on the peninsula”. South Korea is the world’s   gaming market after China, the US and Japan, according to research firm Newzoo, potentially representing a big opportunity loss for Niantic and the Pokémon Company. The   game has yet to be officially launched outside of Australia, New Zealand and the US, with Niantic struggling to meet the server demands of existing players, but plays across the world have resorted to circumventing the region lock by sideloading the app on Android or downloading it with a US iTunes account on an iPhone. It has been downloaded between 10m and 50m times from the Google Play Store alone, while the app has been downloaded from a   Android app hosting service over 5m times.

Donald Trump is alienating his own party? That’s practically American tradition
Is the Republican party trying to ditch Donald Trump? With each of his    outbursts, more Republicans fall off the Trump bandwagon. But this wouldn’t be the first time a major party has repudiated its top figurehead. In fact,   warfare is as old as America itself. When George Washington stepped down after two terms as America’s first president, the country elected   John Adams to succeed him. While Washington was nominally a founder and member of the Federalist party, it was the 1796 presidential campaign  —   waged between Adams and former secretary of state Thomas Jefferson  —   that gave rise to factional party politics. The Adams presidency also introduced America to its first taste of how political parties, designed to promote common cause, could also turn against themselves. When Adams stood for reelection in 1800, his only major ally in the Federalist party, Alexander Hamilton, repudiated him. Writing in a public pamphlet, Hamilton argued that Adams “does not possess the talents adapted to the administration of government, and that there are great and intrinsic defects in his character, which unfit him for the office of chief magistrate”. Without Hamilton’s endorsement, Adams came in a poor third to Jefferson and Aaron Burr. In 1840, war hero William Henry Harrison and running mate John Tyler were elected on the Whig ticket. A month later, Harrison was dead, and despite the fact the constitution did not clearly spell out the duties of a   in this situation, Tyler immediately assumed the presidency. In response, Harrison’s entire cabinet  —   with the exception of the secretary of state, Daniel Webster  —   resigned in protest, and the Whigs kicked Tyler out of the party. Sometimes referred to as “His Accidency” (during his presidency and to his face) Tyler essentially served as an independent, fighting both Democrats and Whigs on most issues, including two stonewalled supreme court nominations. Two decades later,   Andrew Johnson found himself in the same situation. In 1864, Abraham Lincoln selected Johnson  —   the only southern Democratic senator who’d remained loyal to the Union  —   as his running mate on a fusion “National Union” ticket designed to thwart challenger George McClellan. When Johnson became president after Lincoln’s assassination, he faced hostility on every front: southern Democrats viewed him as a traitor northern Democrats didn’t trust him Republicans opposed his lenient Reconstruction policies. This   loathing for Johnson ultimately led to the first presidential impeachment, though the Senate found him not guilty. Perhaps to erase the memory of their marriage of convenience to Johnson, the Republicans ran war hero Ulysses S Grant in 1868. He was such a beloved figure  —   what could go wrong? By the end of Grant’s first term, the Republican party was coming apart at the seams. Grant’s administration was so   that party stalwarts put up newspaper editor Horace Greeley  —   one of the party’s founders  —   as an alternative on the Liberal Republican ticket. The Democrats, also in disarray, pinned their hopes to Greeley too, though he ended up losing badly to Grant, whose popularity far outweighed any scandal in voters’ minds. It’s tempting to see parallels between Grant and Donald Trump: candidates with no political experience with campaigns bolstered by their name recognition. In the same way Trump supporters believe that his expertise in real estate will somehow translate to the Oval Office, so too did Grant’s admirers figure that what the White House needed was the brilliance of a military tactician. Grant failed, just as Trump will surely fail, too, if he’s elected.  In more recent history, the Republican candidate most closely associated with party disunity is Barry Goldwater, who ran in 1964 on a platform that aimed to cut social programs, roll back advances in civil rights and even nuke Vietnam if necessary. Despite attempts by both the liberal and moderate wings of the party to mount opposition campaigns, Goldwater won the 1964 Republican nomination, telling his supporters in his acceptance speech: “I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice! And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue!” Democrats seized on the word “extremism”  —   and the views behind it  —   and Lyndon B Johnson was elected with the widest margin in US history.  Is 2016 shaping up to be another 1964? Will Trump’s extremism drive more and more Republican boosters away from him  —   and toward pulling the lever for Hillary Clinton?  Though some have already written obituaries for the Republican party, I wouldn’t be so quick to call the undertaker. With the exception of John Adams  —   whose Federalist party never truly came together before he and Hamilton killed it  —   every other case of political repudiation has ended up strengthening the party, not weakening it. If more Republicans abandon Trump, and he goes down in flames in November, expect to see a leaner, stronger, smarter Republican party rise from the ashes.

Little Men review – Ira Sachs’ achingly humane family drama soars
Ira Sachs’ dramas are so understated in their ambition, they’re easy to take for granted. Love is Strange, his 2014 film about a married gay couple’s lives capsizing after they’re forced to move out of their New York apartment, argued for marriage equality with   stealth and power. His latest film, Little Men, uses a story about two young boys whose friendship is threatened by their warring parents to offer a piercing examination of gentrification in America. Sachs’ approach is so humane, and his characters so fully rendered, that an agenda never announces itself instead, Sachs’ worldview seeps into you. He’s that skilled a  .  Theo Taplitz is a remarkable discovery as    Jake, an artistic loner who strikes up an unlikely friendship with Tony (Michael Barbieri, equally impressive) after Jake’s grandfather dies. The death results in Jake’s father, Brian (Greg Kinnear) inheriting the building in which Tony’s mother, Leonor (Paulina Garcia) operates a quaint clothing store. Unbeknownst to the two boys, Brian and his wife, Kathy (Jennifer Ehle) have intentions to raise the rent significantly for Leonor as Brian’s sister (Talia Balsam) firmly relays to her brother, the property is worth $4, 000 more per month than Leonor pays. The resulting tensions this stirs up gradually come to affect the children’s lives. The bond struck by Jake and Tony forms the heart of the picture  —   and to watch that connection come under fire from circumstances that are out of their control is deeply moving. The parents, unsurprisingly, lash out horribly at one another when an agreement fails to be made, with Leonor at one point suggesting to Brian that his late father favored her over his own son. But no matter how heated matters get, Sachs and his terrific cast keep the proceedings grounded via a naturalistic approach that is endlessly absorbing and empathetic. No character’s predicament is entirely unsympathetic. The humanity Sachs and his actors depict is profound and leaves a mark. Dickon Hinchliffe’s perfectly judged score percolates throughout. The cumulative effect of the film is  .

Police officer suspended for Confederate flag display near anti-Trump protest
A northern Michigan police officer has been suspended with pay after he was seen   driving a pickup truck bearing a Confederate flag around a group protesting against the election of Donald Trump as president. There have been numerous reports of threats, intimidation and racially charged violence around the country since Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton on Tuesday. Officer Michael Peters’ suspension was announced on Sunday by Traverse City police chief Jeff O’Brien, who earlier said an internal investigation would start on Monday to see whether Peters broke any departmental rules. “He is not working as a police officer,” O’Brien told the Traverse City  . “I do not condone his actions. ” O’Brien confirmed that Peters was in a photo taken at Friday’s rally. The newspaper could not reach Peters for comment, and the Associated Press was unable to find a telephone number for Peters. The Confederate battle flag is seen by many people as a symbol of hatred and intimidation of African Americans following the civil war and the end of slavery. Its official use in southern states came under pressure in 2015, after a shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina in which nine African American members of a bible study group were killed by a gunman who was later found to have posed for photographs with the flag. The flag was flown from the rear bed of a pickup near a “Love Trumps Hate” rally in the city. The truck was then parked near the rally where the driver was seen drinking a beer. O’Brien said the behavior was intimidating and not a reflection of the police department’s mission, according to the newspaper. “We will get through this,” O’Brien said. “The community will get through this. ” Protests over the election of Trump have continued across the US, with violent confrontations with police in some cities. In New York on Saturday, more than 10, 000 protesters marched to Trump Tower. In Portland, Oregon, on Saturday night, 17 demonstrators were arrested. On Sunday, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway reacted angrily to a statement by the retiring Nevada senator Harry Reid which accused Trump of fuelling his “campaign with bigotry and hate”. Conway said Reid should be “very careful about characterizing somebody in a legal sense”. In response, a Reid spokesman said: “Trump owes the nation leadership, not petty attempts to silence his critics. ”

Time’s person of the year shouldn’t be Donald Trump – it’s clearly Vladimir Putin
Donald Trump should not have been named Time magazine’s Person of the Year. That’s not to make the schoolboy error of presuming the award to be a badge of moral approval: I know it merely recognises the individual who has dominated the previous 12 months, for good or ill. (It’s why Time has no reason to regret handing the 1938 accolade to Adolf Hitler.) Even so, and even though Trump was clearly the biggest news story of 2016, he still should not have won. For there is another figure who looms larger over this annus horribilis, albeit from the shadows. He ends this year with a wolfish grin, content that almost all his dreams have come true. That man is Vladimir Putin. He surveys the global landscape and sees almost every sign pointing his way. From Aleppo to the White House, from   to Brexit, this is the year the world was reshaped in his image. He may not have been the guiding hand behind every shift, though he certainly gave several of them a nudge, but together they made him 2016’s biggest winner. Start with Syria, which even in this year of horrors surely merits a special infamy of its own. The leaders of western nations ritually condemn the catastrophe that has been visited upon the people of Aleppo, eloquently denouncing the bombing of hospitals, including makeshift clinics hidden in basements, the flattening of civilian areas, the killing of children, the denial of food and medicine. And yet Putin knows he need not listen. Because the important fact is the one on the ground: no one has stopped him or his Syrian vassal, Bashar   from continuing the slaughter. Plenty have warned that Aleppo will be the Guernica of our generation, remembered among the greatest crimes against humanity. Future historians will ask all the same shaming questions. Why was there not more outrage? Did people not know  —   or just not care? Why did they not act? But there is another comparison. For Aleppo has received the treatment Putin once meted out to Grozny, when Chechnya dared rebel against Moscow. In 1999 it too was bombed into what the UN called a “devastated wasteland” an act of destruction tolerated because it was deemed to be taking place on Russia’s turf. But the de facto permission granted to Putin’s smashing of Syria counts as an even greater victory for the Russian dictator. Not only has he advanced his narrow, strategic interests, maintaining a presence in the Middle East and, in Tartus, a   port with access to the Mediterranean. He has won a less tangible but more valuable prize. He has proved that it is possible to kill or dispossess millions of civilians with impunity. Of course, some will say George W Bush proved that with his invasion of Iraq in 2003. But until now, Moscow might have felt constrained by the precedent of Slobodan Milošević, fearing that there were limits to how much blood you could shed before, eventually, the west or the US or Nato would act. Now Putin has established beyond doubt that there are no limits. Partly because of Iraq, and the fatigue it left behind, he has seen that   international talk of a “responsibility to protect” endangered civilians is a dead letter. You can kill hundreds of thousands and no one will do a thing. But 2016 has provided Putin with other reasons to be cheerful. He now has friends in high places, or in places about to get higher. The most obvious is Trump, but there are others, both near and far. Indeed, November was a banner month for the Russian leader, bringing   candidates to power in Moldova, Bulgaria and Estonia, as well as teeing up a   French presidential contest in 2017. There is a good chance the final round will pit two Putin fans against each other: François Fillon v Marine Le Pen. Like most on the European far right, Le Pen has long revered Putin as a nationalist strongman and was happy to take a €9m (£8m) loan from a   bank. Less predictably Fillon, who will be the standard bearer of the   also gazes   at Putin. Fillon wants to see the lifting of sanctions imposed on Moscow over Ukraine and believes Putin, the conqueror of Crimea, is the injured party, since it was all the western powers’ fault that Russia invaded in the first place. Wherever he looks, Putin can see allies  —   whether it’s Nigel Farage on the right or US Green party presidential candidate Jill Stein on the left. (Stein boasted during the campaign that she had dined with Russia’s leader, even sitting at the same table.) Indeed, given the regimes now ruling Hungary and Poland, Putin can smile at the emergence of what political scientist Yascha Mounk calls “the illiberal international” an arc of states led by people who, like him, regard the free press or an independent judiciary as unnecessary irritants. Yet democratic votes have been good to Putin this year. Brexit was an early gift to a man who has long seen the weakening of the European Union as a strategic goal. Ideally, he’d like to see the EU break up: then he could make a series of bilateral deals with Europe’s nations, picking them off one by one. That’s the long game but just to have the EU weakened, distracted and destabilised will do for now. And with Britain’s departure, the EU will lose one of its loudest   voices. But of course the sweetest victory came on 8 November. Donald Trump veered wildly during the campaign, but one of the few stances he maintained with iron consistency was his admiration for Putin. The autocrat certainly did all he could to return the favour. As one Kremlin ally puts it, “Maybe we helped a bit with WikiLeaks. ” They certainly did. Few credible sources doubt that Russia was behind the hacking of internal Democratic party emails, whose release by Julian Assange was timed to cause maximum pain to Hillary Clinton and pleasure for Trump. As a former KGB man, Putin must be proud of what is surely the most successful espionage operation in history, one that succeeded beyond even Moscow’s expectations  —   installing an admirer and sycophant in the White House. The benefits are obvious. Given Trump’s lukewarm commitment to Nato and the defence of its members, Putin will now have all but a free hand. As one Russia expert observes: “Seen from Moscow, the west has not been in such inviting disarray since the Suez crisis of 1956. Whatever constraints Putin may now feel upon his   instincts, Nato is no longer one of them. ” As the year closes, each day brings new delights for the master of the Kremlin. The US is about to be led by a serial, if not compulsive liar the public conversation of the west is polluted by fake news. This new,   world is pure Putinism. For years his propaganda effort, typified by his TV channel Russia Today, has been aimed not so much at pushing a single message as sowing confusion, making even solid facts seem unsteady. As a mission, it once seemed futile when pitted against the solid framework of fact and reason, carefully constructed during the two centuries since the enlightenment. But those timbers have proved alarmingly easy to rot. He may not have done all this himself. But it counts as a historic achievement nonetheless. If 2016 has been an awful year, and it has, then its true face belongs to Vladimir Putin.

Rewriting the Qur’an: Kader Abdolah and his controversial interpretation of Islam’s holy book
“It is impossible to translate the Qur’an,” writes Kader Abdolah, at the start of his translation of the Qur’an. Prior to   Abdolah  —   then a popular émigré Iranian novelist in the Netherlands  —   had never even read the Qur’an, despite being raised in a Muslim family. But with the fall of the twin towers came the necessity to do so the new focus on Islamic extremism in the West meant that suddenly everyone had opinions about the book, although most had not read it. As a leading voice in the liberal Netherlands, Abdolah was expected to have a view. When Abdolah read the Qur’an for the first time, he read it as a novelist: in it he recognised not only a text of faith, but also a work of literature of such elegance and style that it had the potential to speak to writers all over the world. His Dutch translation was published in 2008 alongside The Messenger, a novelisation of Muhammad’s life intended to be read before tackling the holy book the pair were immediate bestsellers. Eight years on, they can now be read in English, thanks to translators Nouri and Niusha Nighting. So how does one tackle a task as weighty as translating a religious text? Something must be lost in the transition from Qur’anic Arabic to first Dutch and now English. Abdolah laments the loss of “the beauty” “the flavour, smell and feelings” of Muhammad’s language: in his introduction, he declares that he “knows nothing” and that he has made many mistakes. On first impression, these statements could suggest an understandable fear of backlash Abdolah’s translation, which alters, cuts and adds to the original text, could appear sacrilegious. However, Abdolah’s statements reflect not fear, but reverence  —   his respect for Muhammad’s original prose. Abdolah sees himself not as a translator but as an interpreter. Prioritising accessibility over religious mystery, Abdolah makes several weighty, and perhaps controversial, changes. The original compilers of the Qur’an ordered the suras   or chapters  —   by length, making the text difficult to navigate, in order to reflect something of the unfathomable nature of Allah. Instead, Abdolah reorders the suras into a chronological order, allowing for Muhammad’s journey to be traced alongside the story explained in The Messenger.  In his most bold move, Abdolah also adds an extra sura  —   number 115  —   in which Muhammad’s death is described. This addition, Abdolah explained in a recent interview with the Guardian, emphasises the importance of Muhammad in the Qur’an, a book usually attributed solely to Allah. Abdolah wished to bring into focus the “writer” of the Qur’an, a man who was a “dreamer” and “poet”. This addition, however, was also for Abdolah himself: “The last chapter is mine. Three people have written this book: Allah, Muhammad and Kader Abdolah. ” The frequent repetition, intended for the mostly illiterate audience of Muhammad’s time, is omitted in Abdolah’s translation. He also omits the Arabic alphabet letters that begin some of the suras, believed by some to be part of the Qur’an’s “sacred code” a mathematical structure that proves it was not written by humans. But if the Qur’an has lost anything in this rewriting, The Messenger provides new context, enabling   readers to approach the Qur’an with an otherwise impossible level of familiarity. The Messenger’s narrator is Zayd ibn Thalith, Muhammad’s adopted son, who sets out to chronicle the life of his father. Zayd’s unique position in Muhammad’s life humanises him we read of Muhammad’s illiteracy, his messy handwriting (“Hard to decipher. Like the scribbles of a child”) and his   when waiting to receive messages from Allah (“Who was Muhammad anyway? He was an orphan nobody wanted”). Muhammad becomes someone we can sympathise with and relate to.  The two books work in tandem, The Messenger providing context and story the Qur’an, poetry and mystery. But The Messenger also allows for discussion of Muhammad’s more problematic behaviour  —   like the episode in the Qur’an where, at the height of his power, he burns the trees and fields of the Jews and exiles them from Medina. In The Messenger, Zayd speaks to a rabbi who angrily exclaims, “no prophet ever used as much violence as your Muhammad [  …    ] he ravished young women and thought up suras to justify eliminating us. ” As time passes, Muhammad the prophet becomes a politician, a warlord, a conqueror. Abdolah does not deny Muhammad’s violence, instead arguing that such violence is inherent to political leadership. “[Muhammad] has done the same thing many leaders do. The same as Bush, [  …    ] Obama, [  …    ] Churchill,” he told the Guardian. “Even if they are good people, they have [started] big, big wars and they have used violence. ” The controversies of Abdolah’s project cannot be denied and have not been: in many countries, publishers have published The Messenger but rejected Abdolah’s Qur’an, for fear of a backlash. But considering the increase of Islamophobia in the West, there has arguably never been a more important time for moderate, analytical Islamic voices to be heard. Abdolah says he is “not afraid” of reprisals by extremists: “If those crazy people want to kill me, let them kill me. It is an honour to be killed for literature. ” Abdolah believes that the Qur’an, like other holy books, is not inherently violent or dangerous. “It is a dangerous book if you use it as [a set of] rules,” Abdolah says, but as literature, it is “beautiful. ”

Refugees on Nauru and Manus Island may be resettled in US
The Turnbull government has given its strongest signal yet that a deal is in the wind with the United States to settle 1, 800 refugees from Nauru and Manus Island. The Australian newspaper reported Australia and the US were expected to announce the resettlement arrangement within days. Speculation has been mounting about a deal since Australia announced at Barack Obama’s global migration summit in New York in September that it would take refugees from camps in Costa Rica. Since then, the Coalition government has introduced legislation to place a lifetime ban on asylum seekers who have arrived by boat from ever travelling to Australia once they are resettled in other countries.  The defence industry minister, Christopher Pyne, would not confirm the deal but he said if it did happen it would be a win for the government. “If it’s the case, it will be another great achievement from the Turnbull government,” he said on Channel Nine. Pyne said there was plenty of time to make an announcement before the inauguration of Donald Trump as US president on 20 January.  Trump said he would put a blanket ban on Muslim immigration and then “suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe, or our allies”. Among those on Manus and Nauru are people from Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Iraq. There are some who are stateless. Some refugees and asylum seekers expressed their support for the potential deal. Many have spent years in the offshore processing system and, unless they have family in Australia, no longer desire to come to Australia. They still say they cannot go home, but because of the treatment they have received  —   for which they blame the Australian government  —   many are asking for refuge from any other   signatory. Behrouz Boochani, an Iranian journalist detained on Manus Island, told Guardian Australia he was sceptical of the reports but most other detainees he had spoken to would be happy to go to the US. “Be sure that most people would love to go to America, but some people need to join their families in Australia,” he said. “I think Australia has to respect them because they want to join their families. ” Hundreds of men are currently involved in court action in Papua New Guinea, seeking compensation for their detention which the PNG supreme court ruled illegal and unconstitutional this year. “For me it’s hard to accept to go to America because [the Australian government] has tortured me for about four years, and now to say ‘go to America’ I question the Australian government,” Boochani said. “How can I get what’s right from a country like Australia that violated my human rights?” Another said he would like to go to the US, but not before he was compensated for his treatment. The Iranian refugee, who did not wish to be named, has been physically assaulted twice since being detained on Manus Island. “They took my past three years of life. I was born in 1992 and when I arrived here I was almost 21 years,” he said. “Now I’m 24. I missed best days of my life to go and have fun or go to university or play sport. The Australian government keep me in indefinite detention. They have to pay for this. ” A young man held on Nauru said he had dreamed of coming to Australia and joining the defence forces, but he believed the US was a good option.  Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese said a deal would be a good thing. “These are people who are refugees, who have been found to be refugees, who, if they are settled in a country like the United States, that will be a good thing,” he said. Kon Karapanagiotidis, the chief executive of the asylum seeker resource centre, said the deal sounded positive but he was waiting for details on whether it would include all refugees on the island, and how quickly the transfer would happen. “From day one it’s always been about safely resettling people who are seeking safety,” he told Guardian Australia. “We know that’s not possible on Nauru and we know that’s not possible in PNG. ” Karapanagiotidis said their preference had been to have people settled in Australia because they were Australia’s responsibility, but “if there is a deal to resettle all of them safely, quickly, in America, in a country where they will in fact be safe and settled, that’s our priority. ” “The most important thing is that it’s done quickly and urgently given the imminent danger and risk and the extreme poor state of physical and mental health of so many of them. ” He said he wasn’t interested in politics, but all credit for any deal would go to groups and individuals who had campaigned against the camps for years rather than to the government, which he feared may use the deal as a Senate bargaining chip for its visa ban legislation. The Coalition has refused to comment or speculate on potential   negotiations to resettle the refugees. On Melbourne radio station 3AW on Friday, the prime minister maintained his silence on the issue. “There’s always speculation about these things . .. and we never comment on them,” he said. The Coalition’s latest migration bill, which would impose a lifetime ban on an estimated 3, 100 people, has passed the lower house of parliament but is yet to clear the Senate.  Labor, Andrew Wilkie, Cathy McGowan, Greens MP Adam Bandt and Nick Xenophon Team MP  Rebekha Sharkie voted against the bill in the lower house. The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said the government had support for the bill amongst the Senate crossbench. He would need eight of the 10 remaining crossbenchers to pass the bill.

Erdoğan refuses to rule out execution of failed Turkey coup leaders
The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has refused to rule out executing the ringleaders of last week’s failed coup, despite repeated warnings from western leaders who said the use of the death penalty would end Turkish hopes of joining the European Union. “The people have the opinion that these terrorists should be killed,” Erdoğan said in interview for CNN on Monday night. “Why should I keep them and feed them in prisons for years to come? That’s what the people say. ” Erdoğan said the final decision lay with parliament and that “as the president, I will approve any decision to come out of the parliament”. Some fear that Erdoğan may be using the backlash against the plot’s architects as a smokescreen for a wider crackdown on other political opponents. Erdoğan’s allies said measures taken by the government were a necessary and justified response to a coup attempt that had almost toppled an elected administration, left the parliament badly damaged and killed hundreds of civilians. Erdoğan was nevertheless accused of mission creep, with almost 9, 000 policemen, 30 regional governors and more than 50 senior civil servants dismissed since Friday and more than 7, 500 people arrested.  The detainees included more than 6, 000 soldiers and 103 generals and admirals  —   just under a third of the military’s high command. Arrest warrants were still out for 2, 700 judges, and all 3 million civil servants have been given travel bans amid government fears that some plotters within the deep state might attempt to flee. One journalist was listed for arrest, and by some estimates 20 news websites critical of the government had been shut down. Responding to the widening crackdown, the US secretary of state, John Kerry, urged the Turkish government to “uphold the highest standards of respect for the nation’s democratic institutions and the rule of law. We will certainly support bringing the perpetrators of the coup to justice, but we also caution against a reach that goes well beyond that. ” Speaking in Brussels, where he met European foreign ministers including the UK’s new foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, Kerry said Turkey would have to provide evidence that “withstands scrutiny” if it requested the extradition of the   cleric Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdoğan has blamed for the attempted coup. As Turkish authorities consider restoring the death penalty  —   outlawed in 2004  —   in response to the coup attempt, the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, stressed that such a move would rule out EU membership. “No country can become an EU member state if it introduces the death penalty,” she said, noting that Turkey was a member of the Council of Europe and a signatory to the European convention on human rights, which bans capital punishment. A spokeman for German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said the EU was a “community of values, therefore the institution of the death penalty can only mean that such a country could not be a member. We categorically reject the death penalty and an institution of the death penalty would mean an end to the negotiations to join the EU. ” he said. A statement from EU foreign ministers called for “the full observance of Turkey’s constitutional order” but missing was any mention of a refugee pact struck between Turkey and the EU this year. That agreement hinges on   access for Turks to Europe’s     zone, but has run into trouble as Erdoğan has refused to change Turkey’s   laws, a key condition of joining the EU. The French foreign minister,   Ayrault, said Turkey was a “strategic partner” but had to respect fundamental liberties. “After the failure of the attempted military coup, the response must not be less democracy in Turkey but more democracy,” he said. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, in an unusually sharply worded statement, said it was “essential for Turkey, like all other allies, to ensure full respect for democracy and its institutions, the constitutional order, the rule of law and fundamental freedoms”. While Erdoğan and his allies have amplified the sense of an authoritarian crackdown by publicly using language such as “purge” and “cleansing” to describe the government reaction, Turkish officials on Monday expressed frustration at western criticism. They view the crackdown as a legitimate response. One Turkish official said those arrested or fired either were clearly involved in the coup or had known ties with those who led it. “I understand that the numbers seem excessive, but right now this is about preventing the next wave of attacks against civilians and government buildings,” he said. “Obviously, the courts will consider evidence and reach their verdicts. ” He added: “I am starting to feel that we are ignoring the fact that the parliament was hit 11 times by hijacked F16s. ” Elsewhere in Turkey, some argued that the crackdown was expanding far beyond its acceptable remit. Among Turkish journalists, who were already the subject of a backlash prior to the coup attempt, there were rumours of an imminent series of arrests. At least one arrest warrant was formally issued  —   for Haberdar’s Ankara correspondent, Arzu Yıldız.  In an online statement, Yıldız said she had no connection to the coup attempt. “I do not even know the names of these soldiers and generals,” she wrote. Andrew Finkel, the   of P24, an initiative that supports independent Turkish media, said the pressure on journalists had “obviously gone up a notch since the [failed] coup”.  He added: “It’s basically because they can. There are all these dissident news sites that have been very critical of the government, and they want to shut them. ” Other analysts were less certain about the scope of the crackdown. Aslı Aydıntaşbaş, Turkey analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations and a former columnist in the Turkish media, said: “They’re paranoid and they’re cracking down on people they think were affiliated with Gülenists. But I don’t think they’re going to go after leftwing unionists that traditionally oppose AKP [Erdogan’s party] or Kurds. ” Aydıntaşbaş added: “That’s not to say that the crackdown is based on the rule of law, but as widespread as it looks, I think it is still linked to people who are presumed to be  . ” Life has continued relatively normally in Turkey since Saturday morning, but the country is still on edge. The government has called for its supporters to remain in the streets in a show of strength to deter conspirators who remain at large. Searches for suspects continued in several cities, and on Monday a man was killed outside an Ankara courthouse after reportedly firing on security forces. In Istanbul, the deputy mayor of a central district was shot in his office.

Macaulay Culkin: ‘No, I was not pounding six grand of heroin a month’
Of all modern myths, it is the fall of the child star that most compels us. Whether they’re embarking on   marriages, throwing bongs out of windows or abandoning monkeys at customs, we can’t seem to get enough. There’s something pathological in our need to tear down our icons of innocence, which might explain the overprotective nature of Macaulay Culkin’s US publicist, who wants to see all my questions upfront. I refuse. I thought we could just . .. have a chat? The interview, Culkin’s biggest in 10 years, is supposed to focus on his comeback. I’m instructed to avoid anything negative. I ask if I can ask if he has any regrets. “Regrets sounds too negative,” is the response. When we meet, in the lobby of a hotel in Spain, I’m still trying to figure out what exactly this comeback consists of. Culkin’s filming an advert for Compare the Market, which is obviously not a passion project. “It was fun, and we hammered that sucker out pretty quickly. The biggest scene was me sitting on a bench eating  . ” Is he doing this to fund an exciting new venture? “No, not necessarily. ” He’s dressed grungily, long hair   back, boots   blazer  . He doesn’t project the focused careerism of most actors. “People feel they have to be in perpetual motion, or drown. I’ve never had a problem saying I’ve got nothing lined up. Maybe I’ll take the next year off. ” It sounds as if he’s not particularly drawn to acting at all. “I’m not much active,” he concedes. “If I knew what I wanted to do, I’d be writing it myself. ” The trajectory of Culkin’s life feels like fallout from an atomic blast. By the age of 12, Uncle Buck, two Home Alone films, My Girl and (to a lesser extent) Richie Rich had made him the most successful child actor of all time. At 14, he became legally emancipated from his parents both had been trying to gain control of his $17m fortune in their divorce. Culkin married at 17, and separated two years later. Sleepovers with Michael Jackson became public knowledge when he was called as a defence witness at the singer’s molestation trial. I’m ghoulishly fascinated by this alien childhood. I’d like to ask about Michael Jackson. “I think it’s best you don’t,” interjects his manager. She is one of three people sitting with us. “It’s not that it’s a painful topic . .. ” begins Culkin. His manager insists we move on, the PR next to her agrees. Culkin clearly wants to say something, but six eyes are telling him not to. I suspect we’re both wondering why we’re here    Culkin doesn’t do this sort of thing any more, having turned his back on the spotlight. “I don’t just turn my back, I actively don’t want it. The paps go after me because I don’t whore myself out. ” He has spent a decade turning down interviews, and mostly lives in France, where the aloof Parisians leave him alone. (It’s also where Kevin McCallister’s family were headed when they left him Home Alone, but we can’t talk about that.) I get the impression he’s as eager to talk about a price comparison website as I am to ask about one. Instead, I ask why people are still fascinated by him. “I have no idea. I was thinking about this the other day  —   I’d crossed the wrong street, picked up a tail, suddenly there’s a crush of 20 paparazzi. Then people with cameraphones get involved. I don’t think I’m worthy of that. ” Has it got better with time? “It’s been like that my whole adult life. You take on a   attitude, always scanning the horizon. It’s strange on dates, as it looks like you’re not paying attention. But I’ve stopped trying to think of myself in the third person, because that’s just gonna drive me nuts. ” You had to think about yourself in the third person? “Exactly. Macaulay Culkin is out there, and I’m Mac. You guys can play with the first one. ” He’s not averse to a bit of playing himself, for Culkin is the celebrity’s  . You may remember the   a few years back when Ryan Gosling was pictured wearing a   of Kevin McCallister. Culkin responded by creating a   that pictured Gosling wearing the shirt, before Gosling responded in kind, being photographed wearing a   of Culkin wearing a   of Gosling wearing a   of Culkin. They may still be at it for all we know. Culkin’s previous ads, for the likes of Orange (and, in a Partridge move, the rebranding of Norwich Union) trade in      . For Compare the Market, he plays a hitchhiker picked up by the lovable meerkats, who see him as a child, buying him   and making him ride    he’s too big for. In 2006, Culkin wrote an experimental novel, Junior, from the perspective of a certifiable child star with father issues. In web comedy :DRYVRS, he’s a   sadist, unhinged by the childhood trauma of parental abandonment, and defending himself against home invaders. Is all this   what he’s drawn to, or just what he gets offered? “A bit of both. It suits my personality and sense of humour. But I would be game for something   . ” Given this dilemma  —   constantly returning to a past he wants distance from  —   where does his sense of self come from? “From me. I try to figure out what makes me happy  —   and not in a superficial way. I keep my soul fit. ” Is he spiritual? “I know enough to know I don’t know. I was raised Catholic, so there’s a lot of guilt. We’re born with original sin. ” He veers off into a joke. “Since I was told that, I’ve been trying to come up with even more original sins, that’ll really blow my priest away at confession. Like, here’s one you haven’t heard  —   it involves a pitching wedge, a donkey and a bucket of ice. ” And two meerkats? “Yeah! You might wanna record this one!” He reflects. “Actually, I’m very much at peace lately. I can debate with people, and my heart rate never changes. ” And Culkin is witty and affable. Funny, but distant. He offers confrontational figures of speech amiably. “If you want to get into an argument with an artist, ask them what art is,” he says. “If you want to make an actor feel uncomfortable, ask them what they’re doing next. ” (I hastily scribble out one of the few questions I’ve written down.) Are his debates political? “I have leanings, but I’m the definition of a disenfranchised voter  —   I think the system is ugly. This whole Trump thing is amazing. ” (Trump cameos in Home Alone 2, showing our hero the way to the Plaza Hotel lobby, although we can’t talk about it.) Culkin doesn’t want to be drawn further. “Discussing politics is the quickest way to alienate people, so I don’t wanna go into it. ” And Trump has enough column inches? “Exactly! He’s like the Candyman, we have to stop saying his name. ” Culkin was acting at four, an age at which no one knows what they want beyond watching cartoons and eating oversugared cereal. Having described himself as “effectively retired” he works occasionally (voices for Seth Green’s Robot Chicken, cameoing as himself in Zoolander 2) but: “I’m much more proactive with visual arts and writing, my notebook and little projects. ” Of the projects that reach the public, most could charitably be classed as divisive. There are paintings: one of the cast of Seinfeld on the set of Wheel of Fortune, being painted, nude, by  . There’s The Wrong Ferrari, a Dadaist knockabout written on ketamine with Adam Green of the Moldy Peaches, shot entirely on iPhones. Most notorious is the Pizza Underground, his Velvet Underground tribute act that replaces the original lyrics with pizza puns (I’m Waiting for Delivery Man, Take a Bite of the Wild Slice). At Nottingham Rock City, the band were pelted with beer and booed off stage as he played a kazoo solo. They cancelled their European dates, citing a “cheesemergency”. My question about all this is: what the hell? “It’s one of those good ideas you have when you’re drunk, and you wake up and forget about it. But we’re taking it to the end of the joke. We have an album coming out, a vinyl pressing with a children’s choir, a symphony orchestra. We’re giving it away, our gift to the world. ” Does he still find it funny? “Of course I find it funny! We rhyme mushrooms with mushrooms, come on. It’s the same joke, relentlessly. Like, they’re really doing this?” Culkin enjoys the absurdity his fame bestows. But scrutiny has its downside. In New York, he takes walks at 4am to avoid harassment. On YouTube, one can find clips of him being harassed by   with smartphones. In 2012, photographs of him looking gaunt, almost transparent, set tabloids aflame with stories he was addicted to heroin and oxycodone, following the breakdown of his relationship with Mila Kunis. Given his friendship with Adam Green and Pete Doherty  —   as well as a previous arrest for possession of marijuana, Xanax and clonazepam  —   it seemed plausible. Were people right to be worried? “Not necessarily. Of course, when silly stuff is going on  —   but no, I was not pounding six grand of heroin every month or whatever. The thing that bugged me was tabloids wrapping it all in this weird guise of concern. No, you’re trying to shift papers. ” Is there a story there he might want to tell one day, on his own terms? “Perhaps. ” Whatever his recreational habits, I’m surprised by how   Macaulay Culkin is. Plans for the summer mainly involve roadying for Har Mar Superstar and Green (with whom he has another   film out, Aladdin). “Home is where my boots are. I’m a big fan of jumping on people’s tourbuses, making myself useful, doing   and outs. I do everything except the merch table. I tried that, but . .. we didn’t sell anything. ” He has directionless days. He sleeps in, stays up late, indulges immature humour, bounces around with   friends. In short, he’s enjoying the adolescence that celebrity stole from him. Ironically, his personal problems and turbulent relationship with the media have also given him a pretty   perspective. Not a bad epilogue for a child star. “It’s allowed me to become the person I am, and I like me, so I wouldn’t change a thing. Not having to do anything for my dinner, financially, lets me treat every gig like it’s the last. ” He laughs, and this time addresses himself in the second person. “If it is, I’d think: Culkin, you had a good run. ”

Will Wonder Woman be the movies’ first major queer superhero?
The Twitter campaign to alter Captain America’s traditional sexuality was always going to be a struggle. In May, the hashtag #GiveCaptainAmericaaBoyfriend was trending like a Kardashian selfie on the social network. But given Chris Evans’ patriotic superhero has been shown to have feelings for both Hayley Atwell’s Peggy Carter and her   Sharon during his time in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, such a major canonical shift always looked about as likely as Hulk agreeing to attend anger management sessions. And yet we’re certainly about due a queer superhero on the big screen. In the comics, Marvel has brought us gay   Mystique and Northstar, while DC gave one version of Green Lantern a boyfriend in 2012 and even introduced a transexual character in Gail Simone’s groundbreaking Batgirl run  —   though the publisher rather ruined its LGBTQ cred when a different writer later introduced, and was forced to apologise for, the deeply offensive trans villain Dagger Type. Of the above, only Jennifer Lawrence’s Mystique is currently appearing in comic book movies, and there has been little indication the   take on the shapeshifting mutant has queer leanings. But for those hoping to see a little more diversity in superhero films, there is now a sliver of hope. For the writer of Wonder Woman’s current comic book adventures has confirmed what we pretty much all knew, that Princess Diana of Themyscira is bisexual. “Yes,” replied Greg Rucka when asked whether his revamped version of the Amazonian warrior was queer. “I think it’s more complicated though,” he said. “This is inherently the problem with Diana: we’ve had a long history of people  —   for a variety of reasons, including sometimes pure titillation, which I think is the worst reason  —   say, ‘Ooo. Look. It’s the Amazons. They’re gay!’ “And when you start to think about giving the concept of Themyscira its due, the answer is, ‘How can they not all be in same sex relationships?’ Right? It makes no logical sense otherwise. “It’s supposed to be paradise. You’re supposed to be able to live happily. You’re supposed to be able  —   in a context where one can live happily, and part of what an individual needs for that happiness is to have a partner  —   to have a fulfilling, romantic and sexual relationship. And the only options are women. But an Amazon doesn’t look at another Amazon and say, ‘You’re gay.’ They don’t. The concept doesn’t exist. ” Rucka’s right. No one should be too surprised that Wonder Woman likes women when she lives in a   feminist utopia. But there are also strong historical reasons why the superhero should be considered proudly queer. Wonder Woman was created in 1941 by the American psychologist and writer William Moulton Marston, a famously leftfield, not to mention rather creepy, thinker on matters of sexuality and feminism who, as documented in Jill Lepore’s 2014 book The Secret History of Wonder Woman, lived in a menage a trois (and sometimes more) with his wife Elizabeth Holloway Marston (often considered the superhero’s  ) and their lover and cohabitant Olive Byrne. Both women have been cited as inspirations for the character, with Elizabeth believed to have contributed her famous phrase “Suffering Sappho!” and Olive her looks. Will Monster director Patty Jenkins, who’s overseeing the new Wonder Woman movie, be brave enough to incorporate her subject’s queer identity, thereby making her the first major   gay superhero? No one’s suggesting (and Rucka seems to be fiercely against) a   “I’m transexual, Barbara” moment, in the vein of Simone’s Batgirl run, but there are other more subtle ways to offer a sly nod to recent developments. Although Jenkins’ film wrapped in May, it surely wouldn’t require   reshoots for the   to shoehorn in, say, an early flashback scene hinting at the superhero’s youthful dalliances on Themyscira. Early trailers for Wonder Woman, along with Israeli actor Gal Gadot’s debut appearance as the Amazonian superhero in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, have given fans confidence that Jenkins’ take cleaves tightly to the character’s roots as a strong, empowered, independent woman. But it remains to be seen if Warner has the guts to really push the envelope, especially as the studio has cast Star Trek hunk Chris Pine as Diana’s traditional mortal love interest, Steve Trevor. One imagines the suits who helped ruin Suicide Squad (by handing the movie’s final edit to the guys behind the film’s startling trailers) might begin to get severely itchy fingers once again if Jenkins turns in a version in which Pine doesn’t get so much as a snog. Warner Bros got nothing but bad publicity from leering all over Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad, but you have to wonder if the studio figured that it would add five   teenage boys for every fan who objected to all the shallow objectification. Likewise, celebrating Wonder Woman’s queer identity might seem like a risky marketing manoeuvre for a film that will be aiming to pick up the widest audience possible. On the other hand, there’s an argument that it makes no sense for   relationships to remain taboo for superhero movies in 2016 when the   children’s film franchise of   Harry Potter, achieved some its best box office results following JK Rowling’s 2007 revelation that Hogwarts headmaster Dumbledore was gay. More recently, we learned that Gobber, the amputee viking from the How to Train Your Dragon movies also prefers men, without any real associated fuss.  By celebrating Diana of Themyscira’s bisexuality, DC would in one fell stroke leap ahead of rivals Marvel in the diversity stakes and guarantee itself a whopping share of the pink pound come opening weekend next June. There is an opportunity here, beyond doing the right thing and offering acolytes a sly nod to the superhero’s famously unorthodox gestation. And perhaps the Amazonian princess needs a little something extra to shout about, a genuine distinguishing mark, for us to hear her voice through the cacophony of   superheroes heading to screens over the next few years.  Never mind the lasso of truth, or her frickin’ invisible plane, as she prepares to hit the multiplexes for the first time in her own movie next year, a queer identity could end up being Wonder Woman’s new secret weapon.

USA and Mexico soccer fans get on just fine, despite the awkward politics
The atmosphere and aura surrounding Mexico’s quadrennial trip to Columbus for World Cup qualifying are storied among American soccer fans. Columbus has been considered a fortress by US goalkeeper Tim Howard, who on Friday devoted a Players’ Tribune piece to describe just how much mystique surrounds the place when it comes to soccer.  The qualifiers in Columbus come with a mystique of their own, as each of the games  —   before Friday’s   win by Mexico, that is  —   had an identical   scoreline in favor of the US, prompting American fans to adopt the phrase Dos a Cero whenever they played Mexico. That Dos a Cero chant was audible on the way to the stadium as the American Outlaws marched through the narrow Columbus streets on the way to the stadium, banged on cars and got people to come out of their houses. That excitement carried on in the parking lot, where dozens of tailgates started up. Everyone seemed to be getting along. Despite the obvious disagreements over the election of Donald Trump, the mood inside and out of the stadium was carefree. American fans welcomed Mexican fans and took pictures with them. One Mexican family began randomly passing a ball with Americans fans they had just met. Vicente Tlahuextl, who said he traveled five hours from Indiana to watch the game, said the game was about soccer, not politics. “This is my first time in Columbus, first time here  —   I hope it’s a warm welcome by everyone,” he said. “Everyone loves each other, they call it the beautiful game for a reason. ” Inside Mapfre Stadium there was   joking among both sets of fans, but nothing of the kind that has popped up on previous occasions between these two teams. When Rafa Marquez buried the   header, the groupings of Mexican fans quickly let the Americans know it. But instead of hate or fighting breaking out, the stadium mostly just fell silente. No arrests, no incidents, just a meeting of two devout fan bases supporting their teams. Most Americans waded out of the stadium crestfallen after the loss but a few stuck around in the parking lot trying to wait out the traffic or just trying to take a little more in. Joe Crawford and his friend Chris, Columbus Crew   holders, have been to every incarnation of Dos a Cero in Columbus, but neither was impressed with Friday’s atmosphere. “This is the worst atmosphere I’ve ever been here for. It was terrible. It was bad,” Chris said. “This is the biggest sporting event in America in four years and you’re just going to sit here and golf clap? It’s unbelievable, and I don’t understand it. ” Crawford criticized the lottery system, and how Crew   holders were promised tickets to the   game at the beginning of the season  —   but it only entered them in lottery for tickets, which he believes made tickets easier to get for   fans. He also said that hardcore fans should have an advantage for games like this in order to provide a proper atmosphere for the team to be played in. “Clearly we are USA fans, we’re soccer fans. We’re Columbus Crew fans. We don’t have priority over these tickets?” Crawford said. “We get out in some sort of lottery? OK, we understand that, whatever. ” Most fans in attendance seemed to enjoy themselves despite the result and no violence has been reported. Perhaps the most telling moment came before the game, when the announcer gave the crowd the usual message of tolerance and acceptance, and no one person stood up to object. At least in the realm of this rivalry, acceptance and unity are truly being understood.

You thought TTIP was dead? With Brexit we’ll get the same thing, on steroids
It was a fallacy that withdrawing from the EU would save us from the corporate power grab symbolised by TTIP. This week we’ve discovered that not only might another massive EU trade deal be imposed on us before we Brexit, but our whole trade strategy could be handed over to big finance, egged on by true believers in the free market within the Tory party. TTIP is short for the Transatlantic Trade  Investment Partnership, a   trade pact that declares war on environmental protection, workers’ rights and public services, and would allow big business to sue governments in secret tribunals for taking reasonable policy decisions such as putting cigarettes in plain packages. Thanks to one of the biggest   campaigns in history, TTIP is facing a very uncertain future. Supported by nearly 3. 5 million Europeans, the campaign has made TTIP “the most toxic acronym in Europe”. Negotiations have stalled, while politicians on both sides of the Atlantic lob verbal   at the agreement to shore up their domestic support. But what we definitely haven’t managed to do is kill off TTIP’s sister agreement known as CETA  —   a deal between the EU and Canada. CETA does everything TTIP threatens to do, giving big Canadian corporations (and US subsidiaries in Canada) huge power to take on European governments when they fail to toe the line. Unfortunately CETA is well progressed and could pass into law before Britain exits the EU. You might assume that when we Brexit we leave that all behind us, but according to advice from the legal expert Sam Fowles this week, CETA would remain in force for 20 years after we leave the EU. That’s 20 years of corporations taking British governments to task for passing laws and regulations designed to protect people and the planet. What’s more, our government has been working away behind the scenes to push CETA into effect before parliament has even had a chance to discuss the pact. No need to worry about the Brussels bureaucrats when you’re ruled by the most extreme   government in Europe. We now need to keep fighting to make sure they don’t get their way. CETA needs to be halted now  —   for our own sake and for our friends throughout Europe and Canada. But life gets scarier still. Newspapers and the airwaves are now filled by   fundamentalists who have waited decades to design a trade system unhindered by government: a true free market. If TTIP as a thing is close to death, TTIP as a way of thinking is alive and well and residing in England. Why grow food when they can grow it for us more cheaply in Africa? Why keep all these consumer and environmental protections when they simply obstruct the functioning of the market? A bonfire of regulation and taxes can begin  . It will be TTIP on steroids. It’s even being floated that we don’t need to worry about TTIP  —   we should just join straight up to   deals such as Nafta, which has seen Canada sued dozens of times in   secret courts for daring to enact environmental or health protection. Britain doesn’t have the trade officials to take forward this agenda  —   having only 20 trade negotiators compared with the EU’s 600. Not a problem  —   the government is reported to be considering paying top dollar to financial sector consultants such as PwC, Deloitte and KPMG to do it for us. The ultimate “contracting out” the privatisation of government decisions. The result is unlikely to be anything that resembles the British people “taking back control” of their country. Of course trade could be made to work to create a more equal world  —   supporting small producers, incentivising   products, facilitating a transfer of technology and skills necessary to meet human needs and fulfil human rights. But the only way to do this is ditch the   ideology that the market knows best, and embrace a world that exists for the maximisation of human welfare, recognising that this is the 21st century, not the 19th. But that won’t happen without one hell of a fight, and we are starting on the back foot. So let’s not put the TTIP placards in the storeroom just yet. The campaign against TTIP was just a dress rehearsal.

Guardian Canada Week: what it is and how you can be involved
Last week, Barack Obama declared: “The world needs more Canada”. We couldn’t agree more  —   but what exactly is Canada? Robin Williams once responded in an online chat to a Canadian who asked him for a hug: “You are the kindest country in the world. You are like a really nice apartment over a meth lab. ” And so goes the country’s image  —   a settled oasis of clean streets and firm handshakes and shirts buttoned to the neck, as America seethes underneath in a maelstrom of gun violence, pollution and garbage strikes. But a closer look reveals that Vancouver is buzzing with barely disguised fury against an influx of hot Chinese cash. Calgary is locked in a struggle against the very thing that made it rich, the car. Montreal is still reeling from the corruption fiasco that was the 1976 Olympics. In Toronto the former mayor’s popularity only went up after he admitted that the footage his drug dealer snuck of him smoking crack in the dealer’s basement was not, in fact, fake. And let’s not forget the gun violence, pollution and garbage strikes. So to unearth the contradictions and get under the skin of this complicated place, Guardian Cities is focusing on Canada for a week of   reporting. Oui! We’re looking hard at five Canadian cities over five days, starting today by examining why Toronto will be to the 21st century what Chicago was to the 20th, and continuing throughout the week with   reporting on the stories gripping the country’s cities. We’ll also look at some ideas currently resonating across the nation, from multiculturalism to the death of street hockey, and the struggle of First Nations to find their place in Canada’s urban environment. Jay Baruchel reports on the sibling rivalry with the US, Cadence Weapon bares how he feels about how   killed guitars when it comes to Canada’s urban musical identity, Karen Geier has delineated the psychological tribes of Canada’s cities, our Instagrammers have shot the surprisingly unique graffiti of St John’s   …     and we’ll have a deceptively difficult urban quiz.   No matter where you are or how big or small your community, we want you to share your perspectives with us. What are the best  —   and worst  —   things about Canadian city life? How do you feel about Canada’s future? Bust some myths for us, lift the lid, celebrate, criticise, poke fun, praise: it’s over to you. Here’s how to get involved   …     • To keep up with our latest stories, watch the Guardian Cities homepage every day from Monday 4 July to Friday 8 July, • Follow us on Twitter and Instagram @guardiancities and share your stories, thoughts, and pictures of your city with #GuardianCanada, • Check out Guardian Cities on Facebook, • Share your stories in the comments below Canada Week articles, • If email is easier, message the team at cities@theguardian. com or myself at chris. michael@theguardian. com

Migrants break through Italian police barriers to enter France
More than 100 migrants have broken through police barriers at the Italian border town of Ventimiglia and made their way into France, the local Italian police chief said.  They stopped on rocks near the port at the French Riviera town of Menton after breaking through on Friday afternoon and were still there in the evening under the surveillance of French police, said the Ventimiglia police commander, Giorgio Marenco.  “Both the Italian and French forces at the border were taken by surprise,” Marenco told Reuters. The French interior ministry and representatives of the   region around Menton were not available for comment.  A video posted on the website of Nice Matin newspaper showed a stream of people picking their way across rocks, followed by police in riot gear. A few started to walk into the sea.  It was not immediately clear how they got past police cordons. Many of the hundreds of migrants who arrive in Italy by boat every day aim for northern Europe. Ventimiglia’s craggy seashore became the site of a temporary migrant camp last year, which was later cleared away by police. Most of the estimated 94, 000 people who have arrived in Italy by boat this year travelled from   Africa to Libya where people smugglers, who have taken advantage of the breakdown of order there, charged them hundreds of dollars for the passage, often in unseaworthy boats.  The city of about 24, 000 residents opened a reception centre to house the hundreds of migrants who had been sleeping rough under a bridge. About 150 migrants left the centre shortly after midnight on Thursday and walked to the shore, where they remained for hours before heading for France.  “The migrants who have reached Ventimiglia over the past three years have one aim: to pass into France,” Marenco said.

Young Thug’s airport rant reveals a misogynist in a dress
Last week, a video surfaced of Young Thug berating two black female airline workers for not allowing him to board a flight he was late for. In the footage, he calls the women “bum ass hoes” “ants” and “peasants”. As they turn their backs to the camera he chuckles, informing the viewer that their hair is “nappy as a motherfucker” and that they looked like “Africans” that had “been deported”. Later on, he clarified in a tweet that his comments hadn’t been an indictment on all black women, rather just those “two black, burnt” ones. The backlash was swift and incongruously culminated in a brief interview with Paper on 12 December in which he spoke about “the fight against poverty”. But amid the anger was an overriding sense of disappointment. It was as if it was a surprise to find Young Thug reverting to the egotistical, misogynistic braggadocio present in his entire discography. For some time now, Young Thug has been posited as the poster child for progression within rap. His “carefree black boy” aesthetic made him a   darling and a mascot for an emerging wave of renaissance rappers. Gushing profiles rattled on about his services to   with little mention of anything else besides his outfits. It’s troubling how the bar is set so low that he has been lauded for changing rap without really changing anything other than his clothes. It’s as if critics couldn’t hear the tired misogyny and hypermasculinity in his music over the sound of their own applause for his breaking of barriers. “I got 50 foreign hoes on my dick   I’m a nut in all ’em hoes” “She ain’t gettin’ shit unless she suckin’ dick” “She suck on that dick on the   And I just called her airhead” among other equally demeaning lines, come from a man apparently changing the game for the better.  In a recent Calvin Klein campaign, the rapper made   comments denouncing gender: “In my world, of course, it doesn’t matter. You could be a gangster with a dress, you could be a gangster with baggy pants,” he mused. “I feel like there’s no such thing as gender. ” In similarly   moves, he wore a pretty periwinkle gown on the cover of his Jeffery mixtape and modelled a piece from the Calvin Klein women’s collection in a polarising ad. The very same gender he claims not to buy into was swiftly weaponised, though, when he began referring to women as “hoes”. Gender also matters when, in his music, women only exist on bended knee and voiceless. This isn’t an attempt to undermine the effect his outfit choices have had on the scene. He’s received his fair share of stick for how he dresses and has been a victim of homophobia from the public and his peers. His attire may be a pushback against the toxic masculinity often present in the genre, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t just as toxic. Painfully, the very black women he denigrates have been those continually championing his flamboyance. And though we are by now used to raising glasses in clubs to songs about how little we mean to the men whose pockets we continually line, his denigration stings far more than others. The disappointment lies in the fact that he was billed as an eccentric, effeminate exception from the usual  . The problem is, he never really was.  Heralded as the new face of more inclusive rap, he is merely the old face in fancy new clothes. He said it himself: “You can still be a gangster in a dress”. A costume change is easier than a change of content. Patriarchal strictures stay entirely unchallenged, women remain nothing more than canvases for cum shots. But hey, the new dress code is fabulous.

First Thiel, now the Trumps: how billionaires threaten free speech
Less than 24 hours after Gawker. com was killed by billionaire Peter Thiel’s legal crusade against it, another billionaire couple  —   Donald and Melania Trump  —   is already using the same law firm Thiel did to threaten more media organizations into silence. And this time, it could have a direct effect on the presidential election. The Guardian reported late on Monday night that Melania Trump’s lawyers have sent threatening letters and are considering filing lawsuits against a variety of media organizations  —   including the Daily Mail, Politico and the Week  —   for reporting on rumors of Melania Trump’s past, including her alleged immigration status when she came to the United States. This is the quintessential example of the disturbing precedent Peter Thiel has just set by creating a blueprint for billionaires to destroy news organizations they do not like. He has shown that all they need is a little persistence. And in a media landscape that is increasingly dominated by the rich and powerful, that should give even Gawker’s most ardent critics pause. We know Donald Trump and others have gone down this path before. Trump has openly bragged about the fact that he sued a former New York Times reporter in the early aughts for the purpose of trying to hit the reporter involved financially. Trump did lose that lawsuit, but not until after litigation that undoubtedly cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees for the winning party.  And if you think the Trumps are litigious now, just wait until after November. Peter Scheer, director of the First Amendment coalition, explained the consequences of the Gawker case succinctly:  Say five years from now, if Trump loses and people are writing critical postmortems, will they have to worry that Trump will turn around and sue them? Because of the Gawker trial, I fear that many journalists will wonder, “Could that happen to me, even in writing about Trump?” They will be censoring themselves. That is the worst outcome here, and it’s quite likely. But Trump is not the only culprit. In yet another ominous example, Mother Jones, the liberal nonprofit magazine known for its investigative journalism, spent millions of dollars in legal fees when another billionaire, Frank VanderSloot, sued the company and its reporters over a critical story and some tweets from its editors. Mother Jones won the case last year, relatively early in the process, but still faced an existential financial crisis because of the enormous legal costs associated with the lawsuit. VanderSloot then announced a   fund to be used for suing Mother Jones and additional members of the “liberal press” in other cases. Even in the Hulk Hogan case, though many people rightly found the story and sex tape offensive and argued it shouldn’t have been published to begin with, a federal judge and an appeals court panel both ruled Gawker was protected by the first amendment before the trial, and they were prevented from having an appeals court rule on the judgment before they filed for bankruptcy.  But we shouldn’t forget that Gawker was not just getting sued over the Hulk Hogan sex tape case. They were the recipient of a   other lawsuits or legal threats involving many stories of an investigative or critical nature that virtually any   law student could tell you are clearly protected by the first amendment.  In the end, even if you think Gawker deserved punishment, media organizations should not face the financial death penalty for a mistake, even a deplorable and egregious one. After all, there is probably one billionaire or another who hates pretty much every news organization in the world worth their salt. If they all decide to go down the path Thiel took, how many publications will be left when they’re done?

Texas A&M confirms white nationalist Richard Spencer to speak at university
, Texas AM University has confirmed that Richard Spencer, a prominent figure in the white nationalist “ ” movement, will be allowed to speak at the university, despite protests against his appearance. Spencer hosted a widely criticized event in Washington DC earlier this month. At the event attendees gave Hitler salutes while Spencer himself quoted Nazi propaganda and shouted “Hail Trump”. Spencer was invited to appear at Texas AM by Preston Wiginton, a former student. Wiginton met with university officials on Monday, in a meeting protesters had hoped might lead to the cancellation of Spencer’s appearance. Almost 10, 000 people had signed a petition urging Texas AM to cancel the 6 December event and denounce Spencer’s “  white nationalist rhetoric”. Amy Smith, a spokeswoman for Texas AM, told the Guardian the event would be held as planned, however. Smith said the university had not invited Spencer, but would not cancel the event for reasons of free speech. Texas AM plans to hold its own event at the same time “celebrating the inclusive environment and core values that we hold dear” Smith said. Wiginton, who described himself as “sympathetic to nationalists” told the Guardian he had invited Spencer before the Washington DC event  —   which highlighted the racism and sexism of some in the “ ” movement  —   but had not considered withdrawing the invitation. He said he had invited Spencer “primarily because he’s been in the news quite a bit with the Trump election”. “At American universities the education is so   that it’s more of an indoctrination than a discussion of ideas,” Wiginton said. “I’ve brought other controversial speakers to AM on topics that people don’t want to discuss. Things such as immigration. So I just thought it was an opportunity. ” The Southern Poverty Law Center has described Spencer as “a    version of the white supremacists of old, a kind of professional racist in khakis”. He is the president of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist thinktank, and has proposed a   ban on immigration to the US, to preserve a   America.  More than 9, 800 people signed a petition calling on Texas AM to cancel the Spencer event. Smith, the university’s senior   and chief marketing and communications officer, described Spencer’s views as “reprehensible” but said the event would go ahead. “Our students and our faculty, our staff and our alumni are outraged that this is happening to our campus when no one from our campus desires it,” Smith said. Smith said Wiginton had booked the event space before Texas AM had realised he would use it to host Spencer. When the university discovered Wiginton planned to host a white nationalist event they were unable to cancel it due to free speech laws. Smith said Texas AM planned to review its booking policies. Texas AM will hold an alternative event at the same time as Wiginton’s event, Smith said, which will be a “celebration” of the university’s “core values and diversity”. “We’ll have people address the crowd and it’ll be more of an inclusive event focus [rather] than giving credence to some person and their rhetoric that we find reprehensible,” she said. Wiginton, who attended Texas AM in   said he had invited Spencer as a private citizen. He said he had not yet decided whether the event would be exclusively for university students or would allow members of the public. Spencer is due to speak at Rudder Tower on the university campus. Wiginton said he did not know how many people would attend, but the space would hold 400 people. Wiginton said that he had previously hosted an event with Jared Taylor  —   a white nationalist who also appeared at the “ ” event in Washington DC  —   at Texas AM in October 2012. On that occasion 11 people came to see Taylor speak, Wiginton said, after college lecturers asked students not to attend.

Sex in Silicon Valley: are millennials better at free love?
When I turned 30, in 2011, I envisioned my sexual experience eventually reaching a terminus, like a monorail gliding to a stop. I would disembark, find myself    with another human being, and there we would remain in our permanent station in life: the future. I was single and straight. I had not chosen to be single, but love is rare and frequently unreciprocated. Without love, I saw no reason to form a permanent attachment to any particular place. My friends expressed a religious belief that it would arrive for me one day, as if love were something the universe owed to each of us, which no human could escape. I had known love but, having known it, I knew how powerless I was to instigate it or ensure its duration. I knew that it did not arrive for everyone, and as I got older I began to worry it would not arrive for me. On a Monday in April 2012, I stood in line at JFK airport to board a plane to California. I had decided to visit San Francisco because my desires and my reality had diverged beyond the point of reconciliation. I wanted to picture a different future, one aligned with the freedom of my present, and in those years San Francisco was where the future was going to be figured out, or at least it was the city designated for people who still believed in free love. They gave their choices names and they conceived of their actions as social movements. They saw in new technology an opportunity to refashion society, including ideas about sexuality. By 2012, the young people who came to San Francisco were neither dropouts nor misfits. They were children who had grown up eating   cereal, swaddled in polar fleece jackets made from recycled plastic bottles. They had studied abroad, knew their favourite kinds of sashimi and were friends with their parents. Unlike their parents, they commuted to the suburbs and lived in the cities. As they arrived, the cities reshaped to receive their disposable income. In San Francisco, the young people went to coffee shops where the production of espresso was ritualised to resemble a historic   of the hardships of   pioneer life. Nobody smoked cigarettes. They honed their bodies with the aim of either perfect homeostasis or eternal life. They ate red meat only once a month, to time their consumption of iron with the end of their menstrual cycles. They started companies whose names referenced fantasy fiction. They were adults, but they could seem like children. Their sex lives were impossible to fathom, because they seemed never to have lived in darkness. They had grown up observing foreign wars, economic inequality and ecological catastrophe, crises that they earnestly discussed on their digital feeds, but avoided internalising as despair. I’m not saying Elizabeth was all of these things, but she described herself as an optimist. Elizabeth had a membership at a   gym she meditated and practised yoga. She organised   balloon rides and weekend trips. She worked long, punishing hours, but had the energy to stay up all night at weekends, go on cycling excursions or attend silent retreats. A friend of mine had met her at a circus arts class and suggested I meet her. Elizabeth had moved to San Francisco after college. Her boyfriend had moved to the south to go to medical school. No matter how much she loved him, or how much her mother, an infertility specialist, urged her to have children as a young woman, she was not yet ready to start a family. She had a job offer as a consultant at an economics firm. So, in 2010, when she was 22, she moved west and they broke up. Elizabeth had never before lived in a city. She knew the suburbs in Virginia where she had grown up, and the small New England town where she had attended college. She arrived in San Francisco and made friends, some through internet dating. She met Wes one night in late 2010, when he accompanied one of her   to a boardgame party at her house. For their first date, they attended Nerd Night at a local bar. They watched a lecture about the future of teledildonics. On the walk home, they kissed. Then Wes, with the transparency he thought of as mature and fair, gave a speech of   relationship indemnity. He was still getting over his last girlfriend, he said. He did not want to be in a relationship. Elizabeth tried not to roll her eyes  —   it was the first date! They said goodnight and parted ways. Wes had grown up in San Francisco, studied computer science at Harvard and returned west after graduation to work at Google. Somewhere along the upward incline of his precocious youth, he had skipped a grade and was still only 21, tall and handsome. Wes’s previous serious relationship, the one before he met Elizabeth, had ended during his senior year of college. At the time he met Elizabeth, the discovery of how much he liked casual sex was still new to him. Still, Elizabeth and Wes lived near each other. They began meeting once a week for drinks, dates and sleeping over, always with a show of nonchalance. Given the choice, Elizabeth would have wanted a more serious commitment. She was only 23, but she had one reaction to Wes’s lack of interest in their relationship: he was acting like a baby. Fine, she decided. She would also see other people. A few weeks later, she met Brian, a graduate of Stanford who also worked in tech. Soon Elizabeth had two  . Neither relationship had the expectation of exclusivity, or any defined path into the future. She kept the two separate and never saw the men together. They balanced each other, one providing security against the possible failure of the other. One day in May 2011, six months after they met, Elizabeth introduced Wes to psilocybin mushrooms. The trip shifted their relationship. They still did not use the word “love” but they now acknowledged what they referred to as “emotional involvement”. Elizabeth was hired at Google. They took the bus to its Mountain View complex and ate in the cafeteria together. When they went for dinner with Wes’s family, Elizabeth was presented as a friend. Elizabeth did not describe what she was doing  —   having sex with two men on a regular basis over an extended period of time, with the occasional   dalliance besides  —   as polyamory. The word had cultural connotations for her, of swinging married people or creepy old men. Although, like most people her age, she had friends whose partnerships allowed for sex with others, those friends tended to use the term “open relationship” which was somehow less infused with the stigma of intentional weirdness, and did not amount to a proclamation of sexual identity. Still, whatever accidental arrangement she had created, by the end of that year the lack of sexual boundaries was causing Elizabeth no small amount of anxiety. Wes’s crushes from high school were resurfacing. Women on the OkCupid dating site were probably sending him winky emoticons. To allay her growing insecurity, she turned to   and read The Ethical Slut: A Practical Guide To Polyamory, Open Relationships  Other Adventures, Sex At Dawn, by Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jethá, and Tristan Taormino’s Opening Up. These books convinced Elizabeth that monogamy was a choice, not a given. It began to take on the cast of an unreasonable expectation, best suited to people who disliked experimentation: people not like her. For almost a year, Elizabeth and Wes avoided naming the terms of their relationship. They celebrated the last night of 2011 with friends, and before midnight, because she wanted to say it while still relatively sober, Elizabeth told Wes she loved him. He loved her, too, but he still wanted sexual freedom. She had already decided she wanted it, too. They agreed that they would think of themselves as a couple from now on, instead of two single people who slept together, but they would still not be monogamous. Now they had to figure out how to manage the logistics. Elizabeth compiled a shared Google doc that was to become the foundation of their research  —   a syllabus of recommended reading, places to attend discussion groups and sex parties open to the public. They went to a party at a sex club and had sex surrounded by onlookers. They returned another night, for an   discussion group, but most of the attendees were in their late 30s and were either married and “frisky” or desperate to save their failing marriages. Elizabeth and Wes felt they could draw upon certain ideas of the older polyamorists, but had to do a lot of the thinking on their own. After their research, they began to draw up rules. The first held that, on any given night, one could call the other and say, “Will you please come home?” There was a shared understanding that each of them was the most important person in the other’s life. The second rule was about disclosure: if one of them suspected he or she might sleep with another person, the premonition should be disclosed. They agreed to discuss each other’s crushes. If a sexual encounter happened spontaneously, the event should be disclosed soon afterwards. They would use condoms with their other partners. Despite making rules, they would aim to fail. It was a concept they borrowed from computer security: if an unplanned event occurs, the default is to act first, then worry about formulating responses for the next time. Early in 2012, Brian left the country for three months. In the absence of her second partner, Elizabeth felt an imbalance. Wes was still dating other people and she felt vulnerable. She was also coming to terms with what had been a growing crush on someone else. His name was Chris. He happened to be Wes’s best friend. Wes said he wouldn’t mind if Elizabeth and Chris started to sleep together. Elizabeth, upset, asked how he could possibly care about her and want her to sleep with his best friend. They worked it out. Chris is a tall man with a sweet smile and a shy affect. His parents had met at a commune in Santa Barbara in the early 1980s, so the example he had was one of youthful adventure that would eventually settle into conformity. He met Wes at Google, where they both started working in 2010. Chris and Wes became friends around the time Wes met Elizabeth. Compared with them, Chris had a more introspective personality. He was more careful about taking risks when it came to things such as drugs and relationships. By the end of 2011, the three regularly socialised as a group outside work. Soon after, Chris and Elizabeth would also hang out by themselves. Chris knew that his new friends were in an open relationship, but at first he saw his own role as a mutual confidant, with a much closer relationship to his male counterpart. One night, Chris accompanied Elizabeth and Wes to a queer dance party. They all danced together, dancing that evolved seamlessly to kissing on the dance floor. Chris enjoyed it, but felt a little bit like the third wheel. His friends were on MDMA and he was not. Elizabeth and Wes had planned a foursome with another couple later that night, so Chris ended up going home alone. It became an unspoken understanding that if the three of them went out dancing, they would probably end up kissing together. This was true for a whole group of friends who began to coalesce at this time around Wes and Elizabeth, who began to be sought after as gurus by other couples who had considered opening their relationships. The shared Google doc soon had multiple subscribers. Chris asked Wes whether he really did not mind if he and Elizabeth occasionally slept together. Wes said he didn’t. Then Chris brought up another idea: what about the three of them together, he asked carefully. Or just the two men? Chris described himself as “mostly straight but every once in a while  …    ” Wes happened to be one of the men to whom Chris was attracted. Wes, meanwhile, suspected that he was not at all gay, although in the spirit of the times he was having trouble making such a   declaration. He told Chris he needed to think about it. The two men were affectionate with each other, even kissing hello or goodbye, but Chris was surprisingly troubled by his unreturned desire for Wes. I first met Chris, Elizabeth, and Wes in late May 2012, when their experiment was just a few months old. I was seven years older than Elizabeth and Chris, eight older than Wes. I envied the openness with which they shared their attractions. They did not proceed recklessly. They drew up ethical codes to protect their relationships. Elizabeth and Wes seemed to plunge forward through life without fear. I saw in Chris a little more hesitation. They were not bothered, as I was, by the evidence that nonmonogamous arrangements had been rejected by the last generation of straight people who had tried them. I looked at the experiments of the 60s and 70s, and felt they had taught us that communes and other alternative arrangements that celebrated sexual freedom generally ended in jealousy and hurt feelings. We obedient children of the 80s and 90s saw the failures of the counterculture, and held ourselves in thrall to drug laws, health insurance, student loan payments, internships, condoms, skin protection factors, antidepressants, designated smoking areas, politically correct language, child safety locks, gym memberships, cancer screenings and career advancement. We had a nuanced understanding of risk. When it came to sex, I thought we had it much better than previous generations. We knew better than to move into rural communes or force one’s wife to sleep with another man to overcome her cultural programming. We had more access to birth control, and knew more about our bodies. We had a vast selection of vibrators sold in   retail environments. We had rape crisis centres, legal abortion and    emergency contraception. What my married parents imparted as the lessons from the 60s was that it was fine to have as much casual (“safe”) sex as we wanted as   teenagers and young adults, and fine secretly to “experiment” with the more benign and least addictive drugs (although no teacher or relative ever openly recommended it) but eventually we would grow up and settle into the nuclear families we saw on television. Some of us would be gay and that would be fine. Many of these families would fall apart, but we did not consider divorce a structural failure of an institution, but a set of personal problems. Among my mostly secular group of friends, the ceremonies of marriage and death were the only ritual sacraments left. I believed in the mystique of commitment. Could I think of myself as an adult if I never married? Would my married friends become distant and remote? Elizabeth, Wes and Chris believed there were still primary choices to make about sexuality. I wasn’t the only one who kept thinking about the warnings of people who had observed the 60s and felt hesitation. There was a phrase being thrown around the Bay Area only  : “responsible hedonism”. In the spring of 2012, Elizabeth would spend most nights with Wes and the occasional night with Chris or someone else. The three friends would see each other at work, too. When their relationships evolved, the shifts tended to happen not in slow increments, but with sudden tectonic upheavals, usually during    retreats that served as emotional crucibles. Wes and Elizabeth’s relationship had acquired an acceleration, a momentum based on mutual daring. In the way that some couples might spend their energy systematically eating at new restaurants, Elizabeth and Wes went to sex parties. Elizabeth attended two porn shoots, one of them with Wes, the other with a woman who had become another   sexual partner. In June 2013, Wes left Google to start his own company. Between ending one job and beginning the other, he travelled around Europe. Elizabeth met him in Amsterdam, where they hired a prostitute. In May 2013, Elizabeth took a work trip to Tokyo. Chris decided to go with her and play “house husband”. For the first time, they honestly discussed Chris’s understanding of Wes, of how, in Chris’s hopes and expectations, he had fallen in love  —   “filled in the dots with his own lines” as Elizabeth put it. She left the conversation feeling they finally understood their differences, but also felt Chris’s romantic attraction to her break. As untraditional as Wes and Elizabeth’s relationship was, it had started to look as if it was heading toward the traditional happy ending. They discussed moving in together, and finally did so in late 2013. The decision carried less weight with the knowledge that, at least a few times a month, one of them would be spending the night at someone else’s place. The lingering question for both was what would happen should one of them fall in love with someone else. They even discussed this likelihood with an older married couple, a couple in their late 30s who had been married for years. The man told them a story of how in the course of their open marriage, his wife had truly fallen for another person. He called it a “crisis episode”. They decided together that they were what they called “life journey partners”  —   a designation that sounded very hokey, but that was meant to indicate, Wes said, that “there’s being in love, and there’s being in love and wanting to spend the rest of your life with someone”. There would be times when a person had to compromise. In August 2014, Elizabeth and Wes got engaged at the Burning Man festival. In August 2015, I attended their wedding in Black Rock City. To the tune of Somewhere Over The Rainbow played on an electric piano, Wes and Elizabeth, he in a white,   shirt and black trousers, she in a white dress, both with colourful face paint around their eyes, processed to an altar decorated with pink fabric flowers and tasselled fringe. Relatives delivered loving statements. Wes’s godfather recited a Druid prayer. We lit sparklers and held them skyward as the sun set, forming a ring of light. The drone of a didgeridoo obscured the couple’s quiet murmuring. “By the power invested in me by the internet, you are now married,” said the officiant, Wes’s uncle. “You can kiss each other and other people. ” Chris and Elizabeth threw their first sex party in the fall of 2012. In early 2015, I went to the fourth iteration, Thunderwear IV, in a rented loft. A    portrait of Elizabeth lifting one of her legs up over her head in a full split and penetrating herself with a dildo hung over the room. She had installed a stripper pole. The invitation had laid out the party’s rules in a charter, to which every invitee had to agree: 1 Useful mantra: low expectations, high possibilities. 2 Consent is required. And sexy. If you wanna do something, ask first. Bonus points for enthusiastic consent. 3 This is a party. Parties are fun! You don’t have to do anything you don’t wanna do. If you don’t wanna, say “no thanks”. 4 This is a party. Have fun! White ribbon means: ask to feed me (remember, you can say no). Red ribbon means: ask me for a kiss (on the cheek  …     at first, at least). 5 Relationship conversation with your partner recommended before you start partying. There was one final rule: no glitter, at the request of the venue. The party started calmly, with drinking and talking. I stood and talked with one of the two other people over 30. Elizabeth, ever organised, told me she had taken out liability insurance for the stripper pole. The friends had arranged to begin the evening with an amateur burlesque show. We watched a slightly botched acrobatic routine to Rihanna’s song Jump. The next woman performed a   striptease that concluded with her taping a pair of red cups to her breasts, filling them with Malibu, orange juice and coconut milk, and letting people drink from them with straws. Then, to Rihanna’s Birthday Cake, came a striptease that ended with the performer smearing herself all over with cake. After the show, I walked into the massive   bathroom with its Jacuzzi and had a conversation with a couple about the dream of one day living in a backyard casita in Oakland with a composting toilet. I wandered back to the loft, where couples and threesomes had begun to pair off on couches. Nearby was a wheel of fortune that could be spun for instructions. After several conversations that felt like job interviews, I ended up taking turns spinning the wheel with a man. I did so with a slightly exhausted determination to get the show on the road. He was a bit younger. We spun the wheel, awkwardly obeying instructions to feed each other strawberries and kiss. Then we went into the second room to do  . I had never done a  . My new friend explained how it worked: screw a small canister of nitrous oxide on to a     maker. Exhale deeply, then inhale while depressing the handle of the machine, filling your lungs with nitrous oxide instead of oxygen. This produces a   or   high. Deprived of oxygen, the mind dissolves physical sensation becomes acute, a goofy giddiness sets in.   are good for a sex party, because they do not impair sexual function and can heighten physical sensation, although I was advised not to do too many. On my first   the man I had met lightly touched my arm, the feeling of his hands producing warmth and electricity while my vision broke into geometric patterns. During his turn, he asked that I kiss him. We made out for a while, doing the occasional  . I felt airy and happy. We stood up with our hands against the wall and took turns smacking each other with a riding crop. Around us, groups of people lay together on beds and couches, or stood making out in corners. On a couch, a man lay across the laps of his friends, who formed a spanking train. I sat with Elizabeth and took a   after which she massaged my head while a man lightly shocked me with an electrified wand. The   was at the apartment of one of Elizabeth’s partners, a man with whom she had exchanged   . I had overheard a conversation between her and Wes before she left, where she had asked Wes if he would let her go on her own. It was a conversation that was difficult to listen to. I believed Wes when he cheerfully assented, but I also knew my own feelings would have been hurt. Chris was there, too, with his now steady girlfriend. Elizabeth had slyly slipped me a condom, but I didn’t have sex. My then boyfriend in New York had not wanted me to attend the party at all. I was still thinking of myself as just a visitor, or rather neither here nor there, someone undertaking an abstract inquiry, but not yet with true intention. I regretted having been shy in my making out earlier at the sex party, that I had spent the night with one person instead of joining the cuddle puddle coalesced on the   bed opposite. I wished I had other chances for this degree of experimentation, and wondered what it would feel like to be not a visitor to this scene, but a part of it. It had been easier for me to relax, because most of the people in the room had been strangers. Now I sat in a penthouse with a group of sleepy partygoers. We chatted and looked at the view. In the background was the sound of   of orgasms, of water falling from a shower into a porcelain tub. • This is an edited extract from Future Sex, by Emily Witt, published next month by Faber  Faber at £16. 99.

Carey Mulligan joins London protest against bombardment of Aleppo
Hundreds of people including the actor Carey Mulligan have protested in central London to call for the government to end the bloodshed in Syria. Mulligan joined the demonstration just opposite the gates to Downing Street, where teddy bears were later laid in a poignant message from campaigners about the human cost of the   conflict. Mulligan said Britain could lead the way in efforts to address the plight of children caught up in the bitter war. The crowd included children wearing “Save Aleppo”   and other people carrying placards urging a “  zone now” while some flew Syrian flags. A small light   teddy bear belonging to Mulligan’s young daughter Evelyn was among the pile. “Since having my daughter it just drives home even more how unimaginable it would be for my daughter to be in any of these situations and to have to deal with any of this,” she said. “It just really drives me to speak out and do more if I can. ” The actor told the crowd: “I’m safe in the knowledge that when I put Evie down to bed she is safe. The parents in Aleppo aren’t. They don’t know what the night will bring. ” Mulligan, who is an ambassador for War Child, described the demonstration as an opportunity to “stand up and say that we need to do something real”. She has previously spoken out to say the inaction in Calais, where many unaccompanied refugee children became stranded in the refugee camp, made her ashamed to be British.  Mulligan said the arrival of young refugees in Croydon this week made her feel “very proud to be British in this regard  —   we have made a strong stance”. A letter has been delivered to Number 10 demanding Theresa May take action to help end the violence. It comes after the prime minister insisted on Friday that the EU must keep “all options” open if Russia continued to commit atrocities in the conflict zone. Campaigners said the day of action was a rebuttal to Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, who called for protests outside the Russian embassy, because they feel the British government needs to play a stronger role. Labour MP Alison McGovern’s voice broke with emotion as she remembered her friend the late Jo Cox MP’s work in helping civilians in Syria. “It shouldn’t be me who is speaking here today, it should be my friend Jo Cox, but because she isn’t here, we have to be here,” she told the rally. “Fifty thousand children have been killed in Syria since 2011, and millions have fled their homes. “There are 100, 000 children trapped right now in Aleppo. ” Other organisations involved in the campaign include Amnesty International UK, Avaaz and Christian Aid.  Bert Wander, Avaaz campaign director, said: “The bloodbath in Aleppo has gone on long enough, and Theresa May must listen to the people on the streets and support a   zone to stop the slaughter. “How many schools, hospitals and families must be bombed before Syria becomes a priority? If the prime minister fails to act, history will judge her harshly. ” Aleppo was calm on Saturday, the third day of a ceasefire brokered by Russia, but medical evacuations and aid deliveries have yet to take place, according to a monitoring group. No Syrian or Russian air strikes on the eastern   side of Aleppo have been reported since Russia began the pause in hostilities on Thursday, the   Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. But rebels have said they cannot accept the ceasefire, which they say does nothing to alleviate the suffering of those who choose to remain in Aleppo, and believe it is part of a government policy to purge cities of political opponents. The Syrian army and Russia have called on residents and rebels in besieged eastern Aleppo to leave through designated corridors under a promise of safe travel, but very few rebels or civilians appear to have done so.  Meanwhile, Russian warships potentially bringing supplies to the bombing campaign against Aleppo passed through the Channel on Friday. The Russian ships were likely to pass from the Channel towards Gibraltar and into the Mediterranean, heading for the Syrian coast, according to a senior Nato diplomat. The source told Reuters that the vessels were carrying fighter bombers expected to join the attack on the besieged city.

Putin clarifies Trump comment and says America is the world’s ’only superpower’
Vladimir Putin downplayed past comments about Donald Trump and spoke about the presidential election on Friday, adding that he accepted the US is probably the world’s sole superpower. “America is a great power. Today, probably, the only superpower. We accept that,” the Russian president said at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. “We want to and are ready to work with the United States. ” Alluding to   sanctions on Russia in response to its military actions in Ukraine, he continued: “The world needs such strong nations, like the US. And we need them. But we don’t need them constantly getting mixed up in our affairs, instructing us how to live, preventing Europe from building a relationship with us. ” Asked about the presumptive Republican nominee for president, Putin again described Trump as a “flamboyant” or “colorful” man, using a Russian word  —   “яркий”  —   that can be translated with ambiguous connotations, from gaudy to striking to dazzling. “You see, it’s like I said,” Putin told his questioner. “Trump’s a colorful person. And well, isn’t he colorful? Colorful. I didn’t make any other kind of characterization about him. “But here’s where I will pay close attention, and where I exactly welcome and where on the contrary I don’t see anything bad: Mr Trump has declared that he’s ready for the full restoration of   relations. Is there anything bad there? We all welcome this, don’t you?” In December, months before Trump clinched the Republican nomination, Putin called him “a colorful person, talented, without any doubt” and said: “It’s not our business to decide his merits, that’s for US voters, but he is absolutely the leader in the presidential race. ” Trump has for months misinterpreted Putin’s comments as “a great honor” and clear praise, rather than consider the various meanings of the word.  “When people call you brilliant, it’s always good, especially when the person heads up Russia,” he told MSNBC shortly after Putin’s original comments.  In May Trump falsely described the comments as a compliment of his intelligence. “They want me to disavow Putin,” he said. “Putin of Russia said Trump is a genius. ”  Trump has proposed   cooperation regarding Syria,   and trade deals, and defended Putin’s record on eliminating a free press. The Kremlin and its allies have over 15 years dismantled independent news organizations, and the 2006 murder of investigative reporter Anna Politkovskaya has also been linked by activists to Putin’s Kremlin. Trump told ABC in December: “it’s never been proven that he killed anybody. ” The businessman’s top campaign aide, Paul Manafort, was an adviser to Viktor Yanukovych, a   Ukrainian politician who was fled to Russia after a 2014 revolution ousted him from office. Putin also spoke carefully on Friday about the presumptive Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, saying he did not work much with her directly when she was secretary of state.  “She probably has her own view of   relations,” he said. But he praised her husband, former president Bill Clinton, saying: “We had a very nice relationship. “I can even say that I’m grateful to him for several moments, when I was making my entrance into world politics. On several occasions he showed signs of attention, respect to me personally and to Russia. ” The diplomatic remarks belie the cold and increasingly hostile relations between Clinton and Putin toward the end of her time in the Obama administration. In 2011, when he was prime minister of Russia and facing massive street protests, Putin accused the then secretary of state of fomenting dissent. Clinton’s state department, he said, had sent a “signal” and “support” to opposition leaders. On Friday Putin insisted Russia does not interfere in other nation’s affairs, and that the Kremlin would be glad to work with any leader elected abroad.  “We need to bring back trust to   relations and restore the level of cooperation,” he said.

Rain swamps China regions breaching dykes and causing landslides
China has often recently been plagued by heavy rain, and the past week has been no exception. Rainfall of between 100mm and 200mm was recorded last weekend, with Hunan province worst affected. The downpours triggered flooding and landslides, which destroyed houses and blocked rail lines and roads. As well as the seasonal heavy rain, the effects of Typhoon Nepartak had been felt in neighbouring provinces in the previous week. Several parts of the US have had stormy weather over the past few days. A large thunderstorm passed over Phoenix, Arizona, on Monday afternoon and produced a spectacular microburst. Microbursts are sudden, localised, downdraughts of cool air from the underneath of a storm they can produce   but powerful gusts of wind as the descending air reaches the ground and spreads out away from the storm.  The gusts in this case were strong enough to knock down trees, and the accompanying heavy rain caused localised flooding. The Phoenix Sky Harbor airport was temporarily closed due to winds and lightning risk.  At the other end of the country,   thunderstorms were also reported to have caused damage at Oneida Lake, New York, and Madison, New Hampshire.  On Tuesday, in South Dakota and further north, in Alberta, Canada, there were also active thunderstorms which produced hail stones up to the size of baseballs. Northern New Zealand has been battered by strong winds over the past couple of days, with winds gusting to 90mph in places on Tuesday. Gusts over 60mph were recorded on Auckland Harbour Bridge, and a tornado was reported in the Waikato region.

Trump said he’d be the president of all Americans. He’s already failing
In the wee morning hours following the election, in the   ballroom of the Hilton Hotel, Donald Trump memorably proclaimed he would be the “president for all Americans”. It was a remarkable claim for a man who’d run a campaign mired in bigotry and xenophobia.  The following week President Obama declared he was certain Trump was “sincere” in his promise to be every American’s president, and over the weekend, in his final press conference of the year, the president was similarly conciliatory. World leaders have likewise made   gestures. Shortly after the election, the UN secretary general, Ban   predicted Trump would change his views on climate, and a key dignitary at a major UN climate meeting in Marrakech, Morocco, made a similar argument.  “We have for many months listened to the candidate Trump. Today we have to deal with the President Trump,” Morocco’s minister of the environment, Hakima El Haité, told me days after the election. “Those are two personalities. ” Already such optimism looks unwarranted. Since becoming   Trump has called for the mass deportation of immigrants. He’s also selected a cabinet that is mostly white, mostly male, and mostly business leaders  —   in other words, a cabinet that looks a whole lot like him. That’s not populism it’s cronyism. And it’s proliferating, even before inauguration day. After winning over   workers in middle America with promises to restore their slipping quality of life, for instance, he chose a CEO to head his labor department. His nominee has been outspoken in his opposition to minimum wage increases. And Trump wants a man who was once denied a federal judgeship over accusations of racism to head the justice department.  But perhaps the best barometer thus far of whether Trump will really be everyone’s president is his approach to climate change, which has emerged as an area of overwhelming concern among Americans, and which, in the decades ahead, will transform the fiscal and political landscape across the world. It may not rank near the top of people’s priorities list  —   it seldom does. But climate, and in particular renewable energy, has nevertheless emerged as a place where partisan rancor looks increasingly outdated.  Concern about climate change is already at an   high, according to Gallup’s most recent polling, with 64% of respondents say they worry “a great deal” or a “fair amount” about global warming. Nearly   of Americans now say humans are responsible, and while the percentage of people who think climate will pose a serious threat in their lifetime has ebbed slightly, that number is still well over half the population. But forget being the president for all Americans Trump is not even accurately representing his own party’s views. A majority of Republicans now believe the world’s climate is changing and that humans play some role in that, according to a recent survey by Republican pollsters. Mitt Romney, the party’s most recent nominee before Trump, has gone even further by saying we must do something about it. And at least some of the incredulity expressed over Trump’s recent cabinet picks has come from inside his own party  —   including from a former Republican administrator of the EPA. The faint hope engendered by an early meeting with Al Gore, and Trump’s remarks that he was keeping an “open mind” about international climate accords, was unceremoniously quashed last week as he proceeded to roll out what looks to be the most   administration in recent memory. And even before the cabinet announcements came out, Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley was proclaiming Trump will do away with a wind energy tax credit, “over my dead body”. Then there’s the fact that Trump didn’t even win the majority of votes in America. After campaigning on the idea that the American electoral system is rigged, back when he thought it was rigged in Hillary Clinton’s favor, he’s now espousing exactly the opposite: at a rally in Alabama on Saturday, he called the electoral college “genius”. What changed, of course, was who the system benefited. Now that it’s clear the outdated system benefits him, he’s all for it. The same is true of his claims Russian hackers influenced the outcome of the presidential election. Two years ago Trump said Russian hacking was a “big problem”. But now it looks to have benefited him, he calls claims Russia played any role in the election “ridiculous”. Foreign dignitaries like Haité shouldn’t hold their breath, particularly where international cooperation is concerned. Trump isn’t going to be the president of all Americans. He’s going to be the president for rich white men like him.

’It was like a monster’: Hurricane Matthew leaves Haiti in crisis
Hurricane Matthew arrived thrashing at the door of Rosemika’s house in    at 6am on Tuesday.  “It happened so quickly and suddenly,” the    told aid workers. “I heard my neighbour screaming: ‘Water! Water everywhere!’ It had completely surrounded us. ”  Rosemika and her brothers and sisters ran, terrified, to the sanctuary of the hills. Like some of her friends in Haiti’s Ouest department, they lost their home to the fury of the wind and the rain. The water “was like a monster, hitting everything violently,” she said. Three days after the hurricane tore through the poorest country in the western hemisphere, taking with it thousands of homes, the scale of the destruction is only just beginning to emerge. Communications in the   departments of Grand’Anse and Sud are still badly affected and the loss of a bridge connecting the capital,    to the   is frustrating the relief effort. There were fears by Friday afternoon that almost 600 people had been killed, but it will take days before a definitive toll can be established. A Reuters tally of deaths reported by local civil protection officials suggested 842 people had died, but that figure has not been confirmed by the government or the civil protection agency. The government put the figure at nearly 300 and Radio Television Caraibes 264. Hervé Fourcand, a senator for Sud department, said more than 300 people had died in the region alone. The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies estimates that more than a million Haitians have been affected, with hundreds of thousands of people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. It has launched a £5. 8m appeal to help provide medical relief, shelter, water and sanitation over the next year. The devastation has prompted the authorities to postpone the presidential election scheduled for Sunday as they try to gauge the scale of the country’s worst natural disaster since a devastating earthquake struck the country in January 2010. Many victims were killed by falling trees, flying debris and swollen rivers when Matthew hit, bringing winds of 145mph. Most of the fatalities were in towns and fishing villages around the western end of Tiburon peninsula in the   of the country, a region of Caribbean white sand beaches and rivers backed by hills.   Jeune, an official with the civil protection agency working in the mountains on the outskirts of the devastated city of Jérémie in Grand’Anse department, said his team had found 82 bodies that had not been recorded by authorities in the capital because of patchy communications. Most appeared to have been killed by debris. “We don’t have any contact with    yet and there are places we still haven’t reached,” Jeune told the Associated Press as he and his colleagues searched the area. The Haitian government, UN agencies and NGOs are now trying to get food, water and temporary shelters to those who have been stranded for three days already. “We are only now beginning to see the full scale of the damage as we begin to reach more of the communities that have been cut off,” said Marie Therese Frederique Jean Pierre, Plan International’s country director in Haiti.  “Roads and bridges were severely damaged by the hurricane, so there are still some rural areas that we have been unable to reach. ” Prospery Raymond, Christian Aid’s Haiti director, said the charity’s efforts to get vital supplies out of    were being hindered by traffic jams at river crossings. He also said there was a serious shortage of food in the   southern port town of Les Cayes. “People are trying to cope together,” he said. “After the earthquake, some people don’t want to be in camps. They’re living in their gardens even if there’s nothing left and trying to grab protein from breadfruit. But for how long?” Christian Aid has launched an appeal to help see people through the next few months by giving them water, food and cash, but Raymond said that money would also be needed to rebuild houses and buy seeds and livestock for farmers who had lost everything. One of the biggest concerns is that Hurricane Matthew could provoke a surge in the cholera epidemic that has killed almost 10, 000 Haitians since it was unwittingly introduced to the country by UN peacekeepers after the 2010 earthquake. To that end, NGOs and others are distributing soap, chlorine tablets and hygiene kits to the most vulnerable areas. “Diarrhoea and cholera are a looming threat with flooding causing sewage to flow into the streets,” said Yolette Etienne, ActionAid’s country director. “Continued rain and flooding could cause   disease to spread further. ” The immediate priority will be containing the humanitarian crisis, but work is already under way to try to plan for the coming months and years. Yvonne Helle, the UN Development Programme’s Haiti director, said people in Grand’Anse had lost everything   their houses, their fruit trees and their fields. With 80% of the crops in the south thought to have been washed out, its people had “basically lost their entire livelihoods and their food source”.  “It’s devastating,” she said, adding that the residents of the extremely poor rural area had no backup or safety net besides the remittances they receive from relatives overseas. “Of course we need to focus on the humanitarian and keep everybody alive,” she said. “But we also want to get people back to their homes as soon as possible to rebuild, replant and pick up their lives. ”

Hillary Clinton blames Comey letters for election defeat, reports say
Hillary Clinton has reportedly blamed two letters to Congress by FBI director James Comey for her defeat by Donald Trump in the US presidential election. Politico was first to report that Clinton made the comments on Saturday, in a call with donors who gave more than $100, 000 to her campaign. Clinton’s presidential run ended with a narrow victory in the popular vote but defeat  —   by 290 votes to 228, with Michigan and New Hampshire yet to declare  —   in the electoral college that decides the presidency.  An individual who was on the donors’ call, Politico reported, claimed Clinton said the first letter prompted a fall in favourable polling but there was a rebound before the second letter “awakened Donald Trump’s voters”. The New York Times quoted a donor as saying Clinton said: “There are lots of reasons why an election like this is not successful   …     our analysis is that Comey’s letter raising doubts that were groundless, baseless, proven to be, stopped our momentum. ” The comments, which were similar to reported remarks by other campaign sources, contrasted with anger from Javier Palomarez, president and chief executive of the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce (USHCC). He told the Guardian on Saturday it was Clinton’s neglect of Latino voters that handed the presidency to Trump. Comey made headlines on 28 October with his first letter, 11 days before the vote. In the letter, he told members of Congress that new emails had been discovered that could be relevant to a completed investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state. The original investigation had ended in July with no charge against Clinton, who Comey said had been “extremely careless” in her conduct, but not to the extent of criminal or intentional wrongdoing. The new emails were discovered, it was reported, on a device belonging to Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, during an investigation into Weiner for for allegedly exchanging lewd messages with a minor. Republicans responded with bafflement at Comey’s break with policy and decades of precedent, and furious senior Democrats suggested the FBI director may have violated the Hatch Act, a federal statute that bars political activity by senior officials. Comey’s second letter was sent last Sunday, two days before the election. In it, he said a review of the newly discovered emails had been completed, and that it found no evidence to merit reopening the investigation of Clinton.  Republicans, including Trump, responded angrily, alleging that the review could not have been completed correctly in so short a time. Reports said 650, 000 emails were in question, although that number was not officially confirmed. Saturday’s reported remarks mirrored comments, previously reported by Politico, in an email from Navin Nayak, Clinton’s head of opinion research. “We believe that we lost this election in the last week,” the magazine reported Nayak as writing on Thursday. “Comey’s letter in the last 11 days of the election both helped depress our turnout and also drove away some of our critical support among   white voters  —   particularly in the suburbs.  “We also think Comey’s [second] letter, which was intended to absolve [Secretary] Clinton, actually helped to bolster Trump’s turnout. ” Clinton did not speak on election night, instead delivering a concession speech at a hotel in New York on Wednesday. In excerpts from an interview to be broadcast by CBS on Sunday, Trump discussed the call he took from his Democratic opponent in the small hours of that morning. “So Hillary called and it was a lovely call,” he said, adding: “She couldn’t have been nicer. She just said, ‘Congratulations, Donald, well done.’ And I said, ‘I want to thank you very much, you were a great competitor. ’” Politico’s source said Clinton seemed “sad but hopeful” on the donors call, as she discussed the importance to Democrats of political engagement in the future.  In a speech to the   on Thursday, the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren attributed Clinton’s defeat to a failed economic message, saying: “The final results may have divided us but the entire electorate embraced deep, fundamental reform of our economic system and our political system. ” Palomarez, head of an organisation which represents 4. 2m   businesses, blamed Clinton’s failure on a lack of engagement with Latino voters.  He told the Guardian: “We thought this election cycle would be different. Unfortunately, Hillary Clinton was advised once again by Beltway advisers who knew it all, had the models and the projections, but who called it wrong. ”

Canadian taxi driver injured in foiled terror plot criticizes police’s negligence
A taxi driver who suffered minor injuries in a recent foiled terrorist attack in Canada has spoken publicly for the first time, questioning why police didn’t intervene sooner to prevent him from interacting with the suspect. Just over a week ago, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said a terror suspect was killed after he detonated an explosive device in the back of a taxi in Strathroy, a small Ontario town some 140 miles   of Toronto. Police responded with gunfire and an autopsy showed the man died of a gunshot wound.  Officials in Canada said they were tipped off by the FBI about a “martyrdom video” that showed a   man pledging allegiance to Isis and warning of an imminent attack on a Canadian city. The RCMP identified the man as Aaron Driver  —   who had been flagged by authorities in 2014 after he posted comments online praising the Islamic State group  —   and within hours had surrounded the home where he was living.  But when he pulled up to driveway of Driver’s home last Wednesday, taxi driver Terry Duffield had no indication that anything was amiss. He had often taken Driver to work or shopping and described him as a quiet guy. He waited around five minutes for Driver to emerge from the house.  “Even in the five minutes that I was there, no cop approached the car,” Duffield told the London Free Press in an interview. “Nobody tried to signal me, like get the hell out of the area  —   nothing. They did absolutely nothing to get me out of the car. ” Driver emerged from a side door of the home and once in the cab, asked to be taken to a shopping mall in the city of London, Ontario, a 40 minute drive away.  Duffield was backing out of the driveway when he heard shouts telling him to stop. He checked the rearview mirror. “I see like a Swat team coming up behind my car. As I turn to look at this gentleman [Driver] I see my cigarettes on the front seat which had slid over to the passenger door. ” He told Driver: “I think they’re here to talk to you. ” He reached for his cigarettes, thinking he would step out of the cab for a smoke while police spoke to Driver. The next thing he heard was an explosion.  “I’m laying on the front seat, just terrified. All I’m seeing is white smoke and . .. it looked like ashes in the cab. I could hear people screaming and yelling. I’m yelling: ‘I’m just the driver, I’m just the driver.’  As he sat up, an officer shouted at him to put his hands up. Duffield got out of the cab. Soon after he heard several shots, he said, “and then it was complete silence”. The incident left him with minor cuts on his arm and torso and needing painkillers for a sore back. More than a week has passed since the incident, but the    hasn’t been able to get back in a taxi. He’s currently on medication for anxiety and   stress disorder.  “If I hadn’t leaned over to grab that pack of cigarettes, I probably wouldn’t be talking to you today,” he told the London Free Press. “It was that seat and those cigarettes that saved my ass, no cop. ” He pressed the point when he was interviewed by investigators two days after the incident. “I answered all their questions and then I said to them: ‘You’ve asked me all your questions, I have a question for you: why did the police put my life in jeopardy? Who was watching out for me? ’” The RCMP declined to comment on Duffield’s remarks.  After police learned of Driver’s video, they reached out to transit authorities in Toronto and Ontario to notify them. But in a small town where Driver’s movements were limited to two taxi companies, Duffield wondered why no one called to warn them. “In my eyes, the cops didn’t do their job. If they had’ve, I wouldn’t be in this situation,” he said.  “They never called our cab company once to say, ‘Do not send any cabs into this area in this time frame. There is something going on I can’t tell you (about).’ Nobody called the cab company except the terrorist who called for a ride. ”

Simone Biles takes fourth Rio gold on floor with GB’s Amy Tinkler third
Sports Illustrated’s cover shoot was out of date before it hit the newsstands. Simone Biles, posing with fellow US   Michael Phelps and Katie Ledecky, has three golds around her neck. Expect meme artists to be photoshopping in her fourth already. The sport’s new   said goodbye to Rio with one last victory in the floor final, the fifth female gymnast to take four golds at a single Olympics, and only the third American woman  —   after Ledecky and Missy Franklin  —   to win finish a Games with five medals. And if that was not enough, Zac Efron, her great crush, turned up to support her and give her a victory kiss. Cue many, many pictures on her Twitter feed: “Just call me Mrs Efron already. ” Meanwhile,    Amy Tinkler took bronze to become Britain’s youngest medallist in 32 years. While Biles’ achievement was a   certainty, Tinkler’s podium finish  —   the first for a British woman on the floor  —   left her “in total shock”. “This is crazy,” she said. “I didn’t even expect to make a final, never mind get a medal. ” Like the high bar final for the men, the floor is the most   of the women’s events, hitting the sweet spot on the Venn diagram where pure athleticism meets artistic entertainment and so redolent of childhood trips to the circus that you feel you should be watching with a stick of candyfloss in hand. If Biles could not complete a   clean sweep of five gold medals  —   her bronze on the beam was a whispered reminder of her mortality  —   then she is still a wonder of the sporting world. With her extraordinary    ratio, she packs more tumbles into a single traverse than anyone alive, catapulting her 4ft 8in body into the air is if there are jet packs hidden in the soles of her feet. She looked unusually serious when she was first announced to the crowd. Was there something a little forced in that smile to the judges, that flash of teeth? “My legs felt like rocks,” she admitted later, “but I’ve done floor routines like that before so I wasn’t nervous about it. ” Her usual bounce was back the moment the music began  —   a samba beat to which she wiggled her hips and shimmied her shoulders with a finesse the local crowd loudly appreciated. Witnessing her signature move  —   the double layout with a   on landing  —   in an Olympic final is the gymnastics equivalent of hearing the Beatles playing Sergeant Pepper at the Hollywood Bowl. The crowd here screamed almost as loud when she landed it. Until that point Tinkler’s 14. 933  —   a third of a point above her qualification score  —   had been unexpectedly leading the board. Tinkler, who trains at the entirely pink South Durham Gymnastics Club, has the charisma of a West End dancer. Her background music is a   Pretty Woman   and her reflective leotard made beautiful silver arcs as she sprang winsomely along the diagonals. “I could hear the noise,” she said. “As I was doing the routine they were clapping along. That definitely helps. As soon as I finished my routine, I knew I couldn’t do any better. ” Aly Raisman, however, could. The US team captain performed with the grandeur befitting her status as the defending Olympic champion, and her 15. 500 knocked Tinkler down to third. Vanessa Ferrari  —   who had qualified in third place  —   stood between Tinkler and the podium. The Italian had won a world championship on floor when Tinkler was only seven. She amped up the emotion in a dramatic, romantic routine. The melody of Nessun Dorma strained through the PA, as if pleading with the judges for their consideration. There was a long, long wait as they considered Ferrari’s score. Earlier, Tinkler had clasped her hands tightly as she waited for her own, now she seemed almost nonchalant. “I would have been happy with wherever I was placed,” she admitted afterwards. She did have to redo her mascara before the medal ceremony, though. There is something telling about gymnasts’ floor routines, as if their personality cannot help but seep out of them. Wang Yan of China, for instance, marches stompily round the floor pumping angry little arms and looks like a kid working out her angst in her bedroom. Which, since she is only 16, she may well be doing. It seemed perfectly appropriate that Biles’ last competitive pose in the Olympics should leave her looking at the sky: she has, after all, been reaching for the sun.

Chuck (aka The Bleeder) review - Liev Schreiber a knockout as the schlub who inspired Rocky
Hollywood keeps forcefeeding the public boxing movies at an alarming rate. Last year brought Southpaw, as well as Creed, which resurrected the Rocky franchise in rousing fashion already this year, we’ve been treated to Hands of Stone, soon to be followed by Bleed For This. Enter Chuck (aka The Bleeder) a third major film in recent months to feature the sport. Philippe Falardeau’s drama, however, is not a conventional boxing film. There’s no victorious final round, no   retribution, no training montages  —   in fact, there’s hardly any boxing at all, except for a segment where our hero, New Jersey knucklehead Chuck Wepner (Liev Schreiber) gets beaten to a bloody pulp by Muhammad Ali, with whom he endured 15 brutal rounds in 1975. Wepner served as the inspiration for the iconic character of Rocky Balboa, but as The Bleeder makes painfully clear, the   worker was no star athlete. Often referred to as the Bayonne Bleeder, Wepner earned his dubious celebrity on account of his ability to take punishment without going down. On top of getting pummelled by Ali, he also took blows from George Foreman and Sonny Liston. “I just got to show I belong  —   I don’t care about getting hurt,” he says to his second wife Phyllis (Elisabeth Moss) on his way into the ring with Ali. In The Bleeder, Wepner isn’t as a boxer he’s a shameless showman, willing to get bruised to a bloody pulp, just so long as his sacrifice delivers a killer show.  Wepner, played with cocksure swagger by a beefy and imposing Schreiber, often lets his ego get the best of him. If he sees a pretty broad in the street, chances are he’ll try to sleep with her, wooing his conquests with lofty boxing tales. Once Sylvester Stallone appropriates his life story for Rocky, Wepner’s head grows to even bigger proportions, despite the fact he had to fight for any form of payment. Eventually, Chuck’s philandering ways finally catch up to him, forcing Phyllis to kick him out of the house once and for all, and leaving Wepner a   mess. Even as his life descends into chaos following the breakup, Falardeau (The Good Lie) keeps Chuck distinctly jazzy, peppered by a countless slew of jams from the era, and the inspired use of archival footage from the time to visually contextualise Wepner’s world. Falardeau draws exceptional character work from his cast. Schreiber is so good you wish he’d lead more films, while Moss is fiery as always, owning her thick Jersey accent like nobody’s business. Matching them is Schreiber’s   partner Naomi Watts, who’s great fun as a   bartender who acts as a sort of saviour to Wepner. Chuck meanders a bit as it goes along, much like Wepner’s    life  —   but it’s never boring.

Obama has failed victims of racism and police brutality
A long and deep legacy of white supremacy has always arrested the development of US democracy. We either hit it head on, or it comes back to haunt us. That’s why a few of us have pressed the president for seven years not to ignore issues of poverty, police abuse and mass unemployment. Barack Obama said it very well, following the shootings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, that some communities “have been forgotten by all of us”. And now  —   in Dallas, Baton Rouge, Falcon Heights and beyond  —   this legacy has comes back to haunt the whole country.  Obama and his cheerleaders should take responsibility for being so reluctant to engage with these issues. It’s not a question of interest group or constituencies. Unfortunately for so much of the Obama administration its been a question of “I’m not the president of black people, I’m the president of everyone. ” But this is a question of justice. It’s about being concerned about racism and police brutality. I have deep empathy for brothers and sisters who are shot in the police force. I also have profound empathy for people of color who are shot by the police. I have always believed deliberate killing to be a crime against humanity. Yet, Obama didn’t go to Baton Rouge. He didn’t go to Minneapolis. He flew over their heads to go to Dallas. You can’t do that. His fundamental concern was to speak to the police, that was his priority. When he references the Black Lives Matter movement, it’s to speak to the police. But the people who are struggling have a different perspective. The very notion that Dallas is the paragon of policing is something that needs to be interrogated. The Dallas mayor said we have done nothing wrong, but look at your history. Ask people in southern Dallas about the police. Ask Clinton Allen, an unarmed black man fatally shot by the Dallas police in 2013. I was with his mother, Collette Flanagan, the founder of Mothers Against Police Brutality, last year. Countless people came up and told us about all the struggles black communities are having with the Dallas police. Unfortunately, Obama thrives on being in the middle. He has no backbone to fight for justice. He likes to be above the fray. But for those us us who are in the fray, there is a different sensibility. You have to choose which side you’re on, and he doesn’t want to do that. Fundamentally, he’s not a love warrior. He’s a polished professional. Martin Luther King Jr, Adam Clayton Powell Jr and Ella Baker  —   they were warriors. Obama’s attitude is that of a   and they rarely have solidarity with poor and working people. Whatever solidarity he does offer is just   to suffering but he never makes it a priority to end that suffering. Obama has power right now to enact the recommendations made after Ferguson. Better training, independent civilian oversight boards, body cameras. But he has not used executive orders to push any of these changes through. This November, we need change. Yet we are tied in a choice between Trump, who would be a   catastrophe, and Clinton, a   disaster. That’s why I am supporting Jill Stein. I am with her  —   the only progressive woman in the race  —   because we’ve got to get beyond this   situation. I have a deep love for my brother Bernie Sanders, but I disagree with him on Hillary Clinton. I don’t think she would be an “outstanding president”. Her militarism makes the world a less safe place. Clinton policies of the 1990s generated inequality, mass incarceration, privatization of schools and Wall Street domination. There is also a sense that the Clinton policies helped produce the   populism that we’re seeing now in the country. And we think she’s going to come to the rescue? That’s not going to happen. The American empire is in deep spiritual decline and cultural decay. The levels of wealth inequality and environmental degradation is grotesque. The correct response to this is: tell the truth about what is going on. Bear witness. Be willing to go to jail to fight for justice if need be. When the system is declining, it can bring despair. That’s why Black Lives Matter  —   and all other young people of all colors who are mobilizing  —   is a beautiful thing. We are having a moral and spiritual awakening. It gives us democratic hope. Its not about having hope but being hope. It’s time to move from being spectators, to being actors.

Puerto Rico debt relief bill expected to pass US Senate
A rescue package for   Puerto Rico is likely to clear the final hurdle this week after the bill passed a test vote in the US Senate on Wednesday, by 68 votes to 32. An official vote is likely to take place later on Wednesday or Thursday. The bill would provide emergency debt relief to Puerto Rico, which is expected to default on a $2bn debt payment on Friday. But it was strongly opposed by Bernie Sanders and several other Senate Democrats. Sanders called the bill “disastrous” and a victory for hedge funds. Puerto Rico is in a   recession and has $70bn in debt. The bill, passed by the House earlier this month, would create a control board that would oversee the island’s finances and could supervise some debt restructuring. It would also require the territory to create a fiscal plan and fund public pensions, which the government has underfunded by more than $40bn. “We must act now to prevent matters from getting worse,” Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said prior to the vote. The Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, made a   visit to Capitol Hill on Tuesday in a bid to persuade some reluctant Democrats concerned that the board would be too powerful. Democrats have also opposed a provision that would allow the island’s government to lower the minimum wage for some younger workers. Lew urged senators to vote for the bill even though it wasn’t perfect. “The fact that this works and it gives Puerto Rico the ability to move forward is just an overwhelming reason to pass this in a timeframe that prevents the descent into chaos,” Lew said. The Senate minority leader, Harry Reid, said he would vote for the legislation, though he criticized McConnell for not allowing amendments to the bill. The House is out of session until 5 July, so the Senate will have to pass the House bill unchanged for it to head to the president’s desk for his signature before the Friday deadline. “Ideally, we would like to have an open process   …     but we just don’t have the time here,” said John Cornyn, the Senate majority whip. Prior to the vote, the Texas Republican said that “failure is not an option”.  Some Democrats said they would back the bill, though unenthusiastically. “I’m not going to let the adequate be the enemy of the barely sufficient,” said Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate finance committee. Among the Democrats opposed to the bill were Sanders, of Vermont, and Bob Menendez, of New Jersey.  On Tuesday evening, Menendez monopolized the Senate floor for more than four hours, arguing that the bill adopted a colonial approach to the territory, which is home to 3. 5 million US citizens. He said ordinary Puerto Ricans got little say and that the package favored   creditors over island pensioners. Sanders said on Tuesday: “I will do everything I can to defeat this horrific bill. ” He described it as “disastrous” and a victory for hedge funds. “The time has come to stop treating Puerto Rico like a colony and start treating people of Puerto Rico as American citizens,” he tweeted shortly after the legislature cleared the test vote on Wednesday morning. Some Republican senators planned to vote against it as well. “I’m just not sure we have enough in this bill to ensure they will make the difficult decisions they need to,” Thom Tillis said of the Puerto Rican government. Other Republicans said it was the best path forward. “We’re not going to let Puerto Rico go off a cliff here  —   it’s too important,” said Marco Rubio. The legislation is needed because Puerto Rico, like all US states and territories, cannot declare bankruptcy under federal law, nor can its municipalities and utilities. Supporters warned that if the measure failed to pass before 1 July, the island would face multiple lawsuits from unpaid creditors and could be forced to further cut essential services. Earlier last week, a group of bondholders filed a lawsuit against Puerto Rico’s government after debt negotiations fell apart.  “Plaintiffs have an absolute right to be paid first among all obligations of the Commonwealth, to be paid in full, and to be paid on time,” the lawsuit states.  As several senators remained uncommitted, some bondholder groups worked to turn them against the bill, arguing it did not sufficiently protect bondholders and was tantamount to a bailout for the territory. Several labor unions also lobbied against the measure, arguing in a letter sent to senators that the minimum wage provision could take money out of the Puerto Rican economy. Like Lew, Puerto Rico’s governor, Alejandro García Padilla, made a   visit to Capitol Hill to lobby for votes. “It’s not perfect, but we need it,” he said between visits with senators. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

’Ayahuasca is changing global environmental consciousness’
Ayahuasca, as it has come to be known internationally, is a plant medicine that has been used in the Amazon for centuries for healing and spiritual purposes. Renowned for the often extraordinary visions it induces   not to mention the deep vomiting   it is made from an Amazonian vine known to western science as Banisteriopsis caapi and usually at least one other plant. Over the last 25 years or so ayahuasca has gone global, with many 1000s of people travelling to Peru and other South American countries to drink it, and expert healers   curanderos, shamans, ayahuasqueros, maestros   travelling abroad to hold ceremonies. Many drink ayahuasca because they’re looking for healing, some are just curious, some mistake it for a recreational “drug. ” One of ayahuasca’s pioneer scientific researchers is Dennis McKenna, a US ethnopharmacologist and younger brother of the legendary ethnobotanist and author Terence. Some years ago, in an article titled “Ayahuasca and Human Destiny” published in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs, McKenna emphasised the contribution ayahuasca can make to physical and spiritual healing   “if it is ever afforded its rightful place in medical practice”   and addressing potential environmental catastrophe.  “[Ayahuasca is] the conduit to a body of profoundly ancient genetic and evolutionary wisdom that has long abided in the cosmologies of the indigenous peoples of the Amazon who have guarded and protected this knowledge for millennia, who learned long ago that the human role is not to be the master of nature, but its stewards,” McKenna wrote. “Our destiny, if we are to survive, is to nurture nature and to learn from it how to nurture ourselves and our fellow beings. This is the lesson that we can learn from ayahuasca, if only we pay attention. ” Below are edited excerpts from an interview between McKenna, in the US, and the Guardian, in Iquitos, a city in Peru’s Amazon which the scientist calls the “epicentre” of the “global ayahuasca movement”: DM: What can [ayahuasca] do for the environmental movement? I think a lot of people, especially if they come to South America, come away with a really renewed appreciation for our connection to and the importance of nature. I think that ayahuasca is a catalytic influence in changing global environmental consciousness, which is something that’s got to happen if we’re going to get out of the mess we’re in. The main challenge we have as a species is   getting on the   for a minute   we have forgotten our connection to nature. We’ve come to the conclusion that we own nature, it exists for us to exploit, and we’re busy doing that. We’re destroying it in the process. We’re destabilising all of these global mechanisms that keep the biosphere habitable by life. I think ayahuasca is waking up a lot of people and reminding them that, “No, that’s not the way it is. You monkeys are not running the show. The plants are running the show, by sustaining life on earth, if nothing else. ” There needs to be a global shift of consciousness. People need to understand this before they can really begin to change, and so in that sense I think ayahuasca is an ambassador from the community of species. The message is basically, “Wake up, you monkeys! You’re wrecking the place!” It’s very important and interesting that so many people come away with this strong message that they’ve really been moved and touched by something that they feel is an intelligent entity   an intelligent representative of the natural world. DH: Why is that? Why does it make clear to people our connection to nature? How does it do that? Because it teaches us that the plants and trees are alive, in a sense, and are intelligent and sentient? DM: I don’t think there is a scientific answer. It’s more like a philosophical answer, or a spiritual answer. This is the challenge of our time: we have separated ourselves from nature and we really need to   that relationship, and as part of the community of species, which we are   we may deny it, we may forget it, but we are part of the community of species. And I think that the community of species is concerned about this problematic primate that they have let loose on the planet. As a species, we are simultaneously the most dangerous thing that has appeared in the course of evolutionary time and we’re also the most promising. Indigenous people have this perspective that [ayahuasca and other plants] are teachers. They exist to give us guidance and wisdom   and I believe that, actually. [Indigenous people] have been the stewards of the plants, the stewards of this knowledge, but I think that now things are getting desperate on a global scale in terms of the environmental catastrophes that are looming. I think there’s a sense in the community of species we’ve got to step up the game and these are their tools to contact human beings and basically say, “Pay attention because you need to   your relationship to nature” and once that’s understood then you have to start making changes. I think one of the challenges of our species   one of our problems   is that we’re very, very clever. We can do amazing things with our big brains and our opposable thumbs and our ability to use and create technology. No doubt that we’re clever. The problem is we’re not wise   and that’s the whole thing. I think the message from ayahuasca and all these other teacher plants is, “Wise up. ” Literally: “Get wise. ” So that we can use the technologies we’ve invented in a way that supports and sustains life, rather than threatens life. That’s really the message. It’s a profound message, but it’s a simple one. DH: Do you feel Peru is the centre of what you call the “global ayahuasca movement” or is it more Brazil?  DM: I think it’s Peru. In terms of its interfacing with the West, or Western culture, in Brazil, where you find it is through churches [like the Uniao do Vegetal] which have adopted ayahuasca as their sacrament. I don’t think there’s a big ayahuasca tourism industry in Brazil. It may be happening, but Iquitos is definitely the epicentre. People have been coming there regularly since about 1995 and it has grown a lot.  DH: Do you think more clinical studies [on ayahuasca] need to be done? That that would be positive for ayahuasca in general? DM: I don’t need clinical studies to convince me ayahuasca is good medicine, that it’s helping people, but you can publish them [and it’s] a good way to convince skeptical colleagues in biomedicine, rather than just some guy raving about how great it is. . . This also grades over into some ethical issues. There are multiple ones. This is something that exists in the context of traditional medicine. It has already, in a certain way, been   by the West through the ayahuasca tourism phenomenon and so on. Is it ethical to try and take a medicine like this and stuff it into a biomedical research structure? Is that the right way to approach it? I’m not saying that it is and I’m not saying that it isn’t. I just think that we have to be clear that there are aspects here of taking something out of its traditional context. Can it be used that effectively in biomedicine, or do you need the ceremonial ambience? It goes back to these hoary principles of setting. Which are very important. Does it have to be traditional? I don’t think so, but you could say, “Well, why not?” Because this is a Peruvian patrimony. Peru has declared ayahuasca a national patrimony, and you could say, “Well, if you’re going to develop therapeutic protocols and programs around ayahuasca, why not do them in Peru?” You’re not taking it away from anybody. You’re actually creating opportunities for Peruvian doctors, scientists and curanderos to work together to develop therapies that can help people   essentially taking a page out of the idea of medical tourism. Tourists are going to come to take ayahuasca for   reasons. Why can’t they come and take it for medical reasons? That’s just an idea. DH: “Medical tourism. ” Have you heard that term used by anyone else [regarding ayahuasca]? DM: Medical tourism is kind of a buzz word now, especially in the States because of the crazy cost structure of so many medical procedures. . . Ayahuasca therapy is not something you can get [here] at least, not legally, so if you want to access it you can go to South America. In that sense it’s medical tourism. . . I think the ayahuasca tourism thing is definitely a   sword. It’s having a lot of negative impacts on indigenous communities, but at the same time it’s benefitting a lot of people and, in some ways, keeping the tradition alive. But it’s also changing that tradition, as people start to cater to Western tastes and needs. So what needs to develop, I think, is some kind of a fusion of traditional and medical practices that takes the best from both and creates some kind of new paradigm. I hope that’s where it goes.  DH: What you said there about negative impacts on indigenous communities. . . What kind of impacts? DM: There are multiple ones, but a lot is related to economics: the foreign tourists come to a place like Iquitos with their pockets full of money and their values and their interests and it can completely skew the economic situation. . . [But] it can also be good. Economic influx in communities can be a good thing if it’s properly done. Another aspect is that most of the centres [offering ayahuasca] around Iquitos aren’t owned by Peruvians. They’re owned by foreigners. That’s fine. They’re the ones that have the resources to set these things up, but then there’s a temptation to not treat their people well, not compensate them well, and then there’s the issue that you get in any kind of   situation where you have a very powerful medicine, you have people coming in to have these experiences, often they’re put in a vulnerable situation because the whole point of the exercise is to go to a place where you can open up and examine your deepest, darkest fears and secrets and so on. If you happen to be with a curandero who doesn’t necessarily have your best interests in mind   there are plenty of those   you can be mistreated. As you know, sexual abuse of foreign tourists in ayahuasca centres is not uncommon. Ayahuasca, like anything else, is a technology. It’s a tool. It really doesn’t have any inherent moral qualities. It can be used in really positive ways and really negative ways because the ethics of it originate in the people who use it and how they use it and what they use it for.  DH: Just to pull back a second. If asked, “Are plants intelligent” would your answer to that be, “Well, obviously, ayahuasca is a good example”? DM: Yes, ayahuasca is intelligent. Yes, plants are intelligent. Not in the way that we are, but in some ways they’re much smarter than we are. It depends on how you want to define intelligence, right? If intelligence doesn’t require nervous systems, it it doesn’t require brains. . . if intelligence is when something reacts to their environment in a way that optimises its adaptation. Under that rubric plants are definitely intelligent   but not like we are. They don’t have brains and they work on different  . This is part of a   we’re seeing.   works on vast   and ayahuasca has only been known to the West for less than 150 years. That’s a tiny slice of historical time. . . I think we’re only beginning to learn how to use ayahuasca, how we use it as a tool to wake up other people because, if you haven’t noticed, there’s a great deal of willful ignorance, at least, in the States, particularly with regard to environmental issues. Our politicians   at least, the Republican side of the equation   are proud of the fact they don’t know anything about climate science and they deny that it is even important. This is the attitude that needs to be changed. Stupidity is not going to solve our problems and yet they’re behaving as though it will. . . Are you familiar with the author Michael Pollan?  DH: Yes. Food Rules [the title of a book by Pollan].  DM: He wrote a wonderful article in The New Yorker. The Intelligent Plant. I think it really well summarises some of the issues right now that science is looking at, in terms of plant intelligence. I mean, a few years ago, you bring that up, you’d just be laughed at. Now, not so much. There’s really compelling evidence that plants are capable of planning, remembering, dealing with other plants and other things. . . Something else we’re learning about intelligence: you don’t have to have a brain. Brains are   you know. What you have to have is neural networks   very extensive networks of connections. If you look at   if you look at forests, if you look at things on the   these are tremendous, enormous neural networks. You can think of them from that perspective, like the connections between the roots of plants and the fungi in the soil. These are mycelial networks that can sometimes cover many miles. The biggest organisms in the world are actually mushrooms, believe it or not. Not psychedelic ones, as far as we know, but they’re mushrooms that grow in the forests in Oregon, places like this. They’re a cubic mile in extent. They’re 80, 000 years old. Because the mushroom part is just the reproductive body. What’s really going on is the mycelial networks in the soil: the hyphae of the fungi is closely associated with the roots of plants, so it’s a very, very close symbiotic association. This is the intelligence of plants. This is the real thing. This is not just a romantic notion. This actually is real. It’s sometimes called the Gaia Hypothesis, originated by James Lovelock, a geophysicist and geochemist. . . His basic idea is that the entire biosphere is regulated, working together in such a way to keep it within these fairly narrow parameters that will support life. DH: One more thing on plant intelligence. . . There was a book recently published, Brilliant Green, written by an Italian, Stefano Mancuso. DM: He’s one of the leading researchers on this right now. DH: I read the book by Mancuso, which really got me thinking. One of the things he doesn’t address is the idea that plants teach humans, that there is that kind of relationship.  DM: It’s a bit of a leap for him, but it is definitely where this is trending. DH: Are you continuing with your scientific research into ayahuasca at the moment? DM: Well, not so much, but I’m interested in moving in to the therapeutic area and I would like to do some structured chemical, clinical studies. But I want to do them in Peru. And I organize retreats in the Sacred Valley [in the Cusco region] at Willka T’ika.  DH: Can I just finish with one more question, Dennis? You say in “Human Destiny” [the article published in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs] “You monkeys only think you’re running things. ” And that’s quoted, as if someone else said it. Is that what your brother Terence said, or is that what you said at some point? DM: It’s what the ayahuasca said. DH: To who? DM: Me.  DH: Ok. And what does it mean? Is the play on “You monkeys only think you’re running things?” or am I reading too much into it? DM: When I took ayahuasca with the Uniao do Vegetal for the first time, in Sao Paulo in 1991, I had a very impactful ayahuasca experience in which I was shown photosynthesis at the molecular level. Being a plant biochemist I sort of understand these processes. It was extremely inspiring to me at the time. The   lesson was, “You monkeys only think you’re running the show. ” It’s in my book [The Brotherhood of the Screaming Abyss].

Why Ghostbros on Twitter are monstering my Ghostbusters review
There were two things that didn’t surprise me about Paul Feig’s Ghostbusters reboot. The first was that I had a lot of fun watching it. After all, I had loved Feig’s last three comedies with Melissa McCarthy, who fronts the   revamp alongside Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones.  The second predictable thing was that the same diehard fanboys of Ivan Reitman’s 80s originals who succeeded in making the first trailer for the film the most disliked in YouTube history wouldn’t change their tune despite the film receiving a generally warm reception from critics. It currently boasts a 78% fresh score on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, notably higher than Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates, the last big comedy to hit cinemas. If anything, the positive reaction seems to have angered the film’s detractors a great deal more, inciting them to target writers like myself for the having the temerity to fall prey to the charms of Feig’s revisionist action comedy.  For liking it, I was criticized for “pandering to politically correct, radical feminist rubbish” by one reader, a sentiment echoed by another who tweeted that I “played it safe to stay politically correct” for labelling Feig’s achievement a “blast”. Many libelously accused me of accepting money from Sony Pictures to solicit a warm response. And it wasn’t just one or two tweets targeting me, but a host.  The film has since opened in the UK (it opens in the US on Friday) but over the weekend, when the Ghostbros (as they’re commonly referred to now) went on the attack, no one apart from a small pool of critics had watched the film  —   meaning they were trashing it sight unseen. It’s likely they’re to blame for the film’s drastically low rating on IMDb, where over 57% of users gave it the lowest possible score. On Reddit, some have banded together in a spiteful effort to keep the favorable reviews from appearing on the   website.  It’s commonplace for fervent fans to lambast writers for disliking a film they champion. MTV’s chief film critic, Amy Nicholson, faced such a backlash in 2012, when she dared express her reservations about Marvel’s The Avengers in her lukewarm review for Box Office Magazine. But for people to chastise journalists for liking a film? That’s virtually unheard of. I’ll freely admit that the first Ghostbusters trailer, so widely criticized by fans of the original, left me largely underwhelmed. The pacing seemed off, the jokes too few and far between, and the chemistry lacking. Even McCarthy found it “very confusing”. And yet, I maintained hope that Feig and his hugely talented quartet would deliver. Feig is a pro at conducting comedic chaos, much like Reitman before him his leading ladies are all proven comic dynamos. Also, the prospect of a   blockbuster is downright revolutionary: how could that not be cause for celebration? It’s that latter, and vital, aspect that naysayers who have yet to see Ghostbusters will vehemently disavow as the reason they’re not jazzed for the latest iteration. The below tweet does a solid job of summing up much of their harebrained defense: Yet few, if any, people complained that their childhoods were being stolen when word got out that Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill were going undercover for a   update of 21 Jump Street, the beloved 80s show that introduced the world to Johnny Depp. If any movie franchise begged to be retooled for a new generation, Ghostbusters was surely it. In the 32 years since the release of the first entry, there have been spectacular advances in special effects. Also, the original, while fun and inspired, is by no means a masterpiece on par with classic comedies such as Some Like It Hot or Dr Strangelove.  Why is it considered sacrilege to use the blueprint of Reitman’s film as the basis for a new supernatural comedy? The only possible explanation: it stars women. If you’re all for furthering the advancement of women in Hollywood, the strong Ghostbusters reviews should be a cause for pleasure. If the film’s warm critical response bugs you  —   especially if you haven’t even seen it  —   that, sadly, says a lot.

The town that reveals how Russia spills two Deepwater Horizons of oil each year
The Komi Republic in northern Russia is renowned for its many lakes, but sites contaminated by oil are almost just as easy to find in the Usinsk oilfields. From pumps dripping oil and huge ponds of black sludge to dying trees and undergrowth  —   a likely sign of an underground pipeline leak  —   these spills are relatively small and rarely garner media attention. But they add up quickly, threatening fish stocks, pasture land and drinking water. According to the natural resources and environment minister, Sergei Donskoi, 1. 5m tonnes of oil are spilled in Russia each year. That’s more than twice the amount released by the   Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The main problem, according to the natural resources ministry, is that 60% of pipeline infrastructure is deteriorated. And with fines inexpensive and oversight lax, oil companies find it more profitable to patch up holes and pour sand on spills  —   or do nothing at all  —   than invest in quality infrastructure and comprehensive cleanups, according to activists. “The pipelines are very worn out, they’re left over from the USSR,” said Greenpeace research projects coordinator, Vasily Yablokov. “The oil companies have realised they’re losing a lot of oil and are starting to replace them, but it’s laughable. They need to do much more. ” While Russia’s oil and gas production provides more than half the state budget every year, it exacts a huge price on the environment and local residents. A state energy statistics bureau told Greenpeace it had registered 11, 709 pipeline breaks in Russia in 2014. In contrast, Canada reported five pipeline accidents (involving human injury) and 133 incidents involving natural gas and oil pipelines in 2014. The Komi Republic is where Russia’s first oil production facility opened in 1745, and the Soviet Union started developing the country’s modern oil industry here in the 1960s and 70s. Usinsk, a sleepy town of 39, 000 people, is the regional oil hub. The Usinsk oil field is licensed largely to Lukoil, which bought its Komi oil drilling assets from Komitek in 1999 and began expanding production. “More Usinsk oil to the motherland!” giant letters proclaim on top of one prefab flat block. Just south of the Arctic Circle, the sun doesn’t even set in Usinsk in the summer, and it’s reachable by car only when rivers freeze to make “winter roads”.  Komi’s aging oil infrastructure has been prone to accidents. In 1994, a pipeline break in Usinsk gushed up more than 60, 000 tonnes of oil (many estimates put that figure at twice as much) one of the biggest spills ever on land. Spills in 2013, 2014 and 2015 released hundreds of tonnes of oil on to the snow and river ice. Greenpeace says that in 2014, a   “oil patrol” by its volunteers discovered 201 contaminated sites (mostly from pipeline breaks) in the Usinsk oilfield, which is licensed largely to Lukoil, and filed official complaints for each. A trip organised by Greenpeace and the local news site 7x7 in July reported that at least six of these sites were still filled with oil. At a meeting with journalists and Greenpeace,   representatives said the 201 sites had been investigated and no oil spill was found at 67 of them. However, Greenpeace has photographs of violations at every site. Representatives admitted the subcontractor that checked the sites could have mistaken the coordinates of some of them. According to Lukoil spokesman Sergei Makarov, a new programme by the company has liquidated more than 50 pools of leaked oil. But since satellite imagery has shown likely spills in areas of the Usinsk oilfields that Greenpeace cannot access, the actual number of contaminated sites is likely far higher than 201, Yablokov believes. “It’s like a train that they’re laying rails under as it goes, it goes further and they lay more rail, and that train is oil extraction in the regions,” Yablokov said. Besides the six known sites, Greenpeace said the July visit also found three new oil spills along the way, including one near a site that Greenpeace volunteers removed 20 tonnes of oil from in 2014. At the site of one pipeline break, the Guardian saw that a large amount of oil had been removed by Lukoil workers and the site considered “reclaimed”. But the haphazard canals   it were still full of thick, unctuous water with a rainbow film on top, and white paint on the birch tree trunks could not cover the black trace of oil, Greenpeace says. Locals in the villages around Usinsk complain that the frequent oil spills pollute their drinking water, contaminate the river fish and reindeer they depend on for food and cause chronic health conditions.  Statistics obtained in 2010 by local activists from the hospital in   a village of 1, 300 on the Pechora river that has suffered from many of the large spills, showed rises in almost every kind of illness. Nervous system illnesses in adults, for instance, grew from 26 in 1995 to 70 in 2009. In patients under 18 years of age, they skyrocketed from 72 to 254.  Spokesman Sergei Makarov said   was investing 20bn roubles (£230m) in environmental measures and would change 370km of old pipeline in 2016, out of a   pipeline network in the region. The company reported only six oil spills in 2015, although Makarov admitted “some of our employees don’t want to report (spills) because a leak means poor quality work”.  In late May, more than 50 residents of   protested the effects of oil drilling and plans for a new oil well near the village. Lukoil Komi plans to increase its production from 15. 8m tonnes of oil in 2014 to 21. 5m tonnes in 2019. “We’re not telling oil companies to leave, we are saying drill in a way so that we can live with clean air and water,” local biology teacher and activist Yekaterina Dyachkova said. “Of course we depend on oil companies because there is no other work. ” The aftermath of oil spills isn’t limited to Komi. Northern rivers such as the Pechora carry 500, 000 tonnes of oil into the Arctic Ocean every year, the state hydrometeorology and environmental monitoring service reported in 2011. More than 11, 000 people have signed a Greenpeace petition demanding oil companies be required to replace by 2022 all oil pipelines more than 25 years old. Without stricter enforcement, the situation is unlikely to change. The average return on assets for oil companies in Russia was twice as high as in other countries, according to a recent Greenpeace report. That’s thanks to huge government tax breaks and subsidies, as well as “conditions in which oil companies are able to avoid full financial responsibility for oil spills” and not replace pipelines, it said. “We need the cost of oil drilling to include protecting nature,” Yablokov said. “It won’t be quite as profitable a business, but we will be able to preserve the environment. ”

On your marks, get set, wait: traffic jams clog Rio ahead of Olympic Games
Special traffic regulations giving priority to athletes and VIP visitors to the Rio 2016 games have caused 20km (12. 5 mile) traffic jams in the streets of Rio de Janeiro, days ahead of the opening ceremony.  Since the new dedicated Olympic lanes opened on Monday, traffic during the morning rush hour has been reduced to a crawl with average speeds of less than 15 km per hour, according to O Globo. City officials hope the congestion will be eased by a new metro extension, which opened on Monday  —   more than two years behind schedule. But for the duration of the Games, the gleaming new subway service will only be available to Olympic ticket and pass holders. Commuters will not be allowed to use the extension until the end of the year. To further reduce gridlock, schools will be closed for the duration of the Games and Mayor Eduardo Paes has declared four local holidays on key dates: this Thursday for the torch relay’s arrival in the city on Friday for the opening ceremony, 18 August for the triathlon and on the Monday after the closing ceremony, when 100, 000 visitors are expected to leave Rio. Rio is the fourth worst city in the world for traffic jams, according to one index. Even though the government has spent more than £800m ($1, 070) on new highways and rapid bus transport systems to alleviate the problems ahead of the Games, drivers often find journey times double or triple as a result of congestion, particularly around the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon (where the Olympic rowing will be staged) and on the road between the South Zone and Barra da Tijuca (the site of the Olympic Park). The new metro is only a partial solution because it stops more than 10km short of the Games venues. For the remainder of the journey, visitors will have to use buses or taxis. Efforts to improve mobility have been complicated by numerous bomb scares, the most recent of which forced the temporary closure of Santos Dumont airport. It was a false alarm, one of more than half a dozen in the past two weeks.

Benjamin Patterson: the Fluxus artist who composed with ants
Benjamin Patterson was there at the very beginning of Fluxus, performing his own composition at the first concert   by George Maciunas in Germany, in 1962. Yet while   figures such as Yoko Ono, Nam June Paik and La Monte Young have all enjoyed a certain purchase with   habitués (even among those who may not be intimately familiar with specific works) the contributions of this bassist, sculptor, painter and collagist have not been placed at the center of conceptual art’s history after Dada. At least not yet. In recent years there have been indications that Patterson’s reputation is on the rise thanks to a slate of archival audio releases, a comprehensive 2010 exhibition of old and newer pieces at Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, as well as similar programming at the Studio Museum in Harlem. And while Patterson’s death last week, at age 82, puts an end to the story of his creations and improvisations, it also offers an opportunity to assess more accurately the scope and impact of this African American artist’s groundbreaking work. He was classically trained on the   only to discover that America was not ready to hire black symphony musicians. So he found another way to leave his mark: before Gyorgy Ligeti and Peter Maxwell Davies collaborated with the African American singer William Pearson, the baritone was featured alongside Patterson in a performance of his Duo For Voice And a String Instrument  —   one of the pieces presented at the first Fluxus concert. According to the composer, sometime jazz trombonist and Columbia professor of American music George Lewis, “Ben’s work was laconic, whimsical, convivial and probing by turns. ” In an email exchange, Lewis says that Patterson “crossed boundaries between visual art, music, and performance with alacrity” and added that the artist’s early   piece, Variations for a Double Bass, “anticipated by a decade the materiality of Helmut Lachenmann, while his even more influential Paper Piece encouraged audiences to enact and exchange personal and communitarian visions in sound and gesture. ” Patterson’s openness to indeterminacy and his welcoming of audience participation fit neatly within the parameters of Fluxus’s charm, which was typically driven by chance and ephemerality. Though even as he helped codify the practices of “action as composition” Patterson pushed himself to create works that offered a substantive feel running in parallel with a   modern art concept. The gestation of his 1960s piece Ants gives a sense of the artist’s playfulness and his deliberate method. It started as a visual idea: Patterson began composing Ants by holding its titular specimens in reserve, then allowing them to escape across a piece of white paper. After photographing this exodus from his custody, Patterson observed the ants’ positions on the resulting photographs, and transcribed these positions as notes on musical staffs. (You can find reproductions of each stage in this invaluable exhibition book and CD package.) Patterson’s hypothesis was that this could be a new approach to aleatoric (or “chance based”) music. However, “a   on my   was quite disappointing,” Patterson wrote. “Only much later did I realize that what I had discovered was a ‘method’   …     and of course a ‘method’ is not ‘music’. ” In 1964, Patterson reopened his ant files and came up with notated music that he decided should be presented “in conjunction” with any 1962 “composition” by Maciunas  —   what with simultaneity being another frequent component of Fluxus work. A recording of Ants by German pianist Steffen Schleiermacher, released on the highly enjoyable 2015 album Fluxus Piano, reveals that Patterson’s final score favors some of the jabbing, pointillistic violence of the era’s “serial music” modernism. The shattering musical shards are interesting on their own  —   though it’s also fascinating to hear in conjunction with another Maciunas piece. (The composition superimposed over Ants on Schleiermacher’s album is Maciunas’s   work Solo for Sick Man.) As it happened, Patterson once intended to study with one of the era’s priests of atonal complexity, Karlheinz Stockhausen. But their meeting went so poorly that Patterson said he “went into isolation for three days to ponder a more socially responsible way of making art”. After an unplanned encounter with John Cage and pianist David Tudor resulted in an invitation to play at a concert soon thereafter, Patterson’s move toward more   music was settled  —   and Paper Piece followed quickly. By the end of the 60s, Patterson had retired from the art world. His stated reasons involved needing to provide for his family he soon obtained a degree in library science (and over time, he also established a noteworthy career as an arts administrator). But in his writings, he also expressed some distress over the inability of Fluxus to deal with the politics of its era. “In general I think Fluxus did sit on the fence,” Patterson wrote. “True, many of the Fluxus artists during that time were very willing to ‘confess’ to harmless friends that they were really anarchists, communists, socialists   something or other in that direction. But I must state that I never got a telephone call from ‘Fluxus Central’ asking me to join next Saturday’s March on Washington  —   for any purpose.   …     Yes, I was disgusted, and yes, the lack of support for civil rights and antiwar efforts was an important factor in my subsequent ‘retirement’ from the art scene. ” This uneasy relationship between Patterson’s artistic legacy and his racial identity was not resolved by his early retirement, either. In her introduction to the exhibition book that accompanied Houston’s 2010 exhibition, senior curator Valerie Cassel Oliver recounted seeing photographs of early Fluxus activities and thinking “Who is the black man in this picture?” The answer she discovered, over her years working with Patterson, was that he was “a radical presence in the midst of a radical avant garde”. “Historians of experimentalism still seem unsure as to how to engage Ben as an African American artist,” Lewis told me. “While Ben was hardly disengaged from African American history and culture, his work was rooted in a mobile, fluid cosmopolitanism that declined to be overdetermined by race. ” And while Lewis notes that Fluxus publications of the period were scrupulous about documenting Patterson’s contributions, he says the same has not proved true in the   literature. “At least part of that could be due to Ben’s own modesty and ” Lewis said. “He was hardly a tireless  .   …     [But] when you look at how his work is portrayed in scholarly histories, though, you become obliged to call into question the reasons for the discrepancies between those histories and what his fellow artists said and experienced. ” After his children grew up and left the home, Patterson returned to    —   diving back into readymades and collages, but also moving into new forms of sculpture and painting, many of which Oliver presented in Houston. Over email, the curator remembered Patterson as “thoughtful, kind and filled with enormous curiosity and a zeal for life. His many works  —   whether visual art objects, scores for actions or performances  —   were so layered and multifaceted that it took a moment to realize that they were built upon rigorous research, cloaked in a witty haiku. ”  Oliver also forwarded news of a   final project, too: specifically, an online lottery meant to crowdfund a portrait book covering 25 years of Fluxus activity. The drawing will be held on 2 September, in Germany, in lieu of a funeral, which an associate there said “he did not want”. “He died doing what he loved best, making art,” Oliver said. “I feel so immensely privileged to have shared his brilliance with the world. ” That sentiment was echoed by Schleiermacher, the German pianist, when I reached him over email to ask how he chose which Maciunas piece would go with his performance of Patterson’s music. Outside of assuring me that the superimposition of Fluxus pieces was achieved “according to strict Cagean chance operations,” he said “Patterson’s Ants will continue their wanderings  —   and who knows where Patterson and his double bass will wander now. In any case, Fluxus will go on. ”

Second bank hit by ’sophisticated’ malware attack, says Swift
Swift, the global financial messaging network that banks use to move billions of dollars every day, warned on Thursday of a second malware attack similar to the one that led to February’s $81 million cyberheist at the Bangladesh central bank. The second case targeted a commercial bank, Swift spokeswoman Natasha de Teran said, without naming it. It was not immediately clear how much money, if any, was stolen in the second attack.  Swift said in a statement that the attackers exhibited a “deep and sophisticated knowledge of specific operational controls” at targeted banks and may have been aided by “malicious insiders or cyber attacks, or a combination of both”. The organization, a Belgian   owned by member banks, said that forensic experts believe the second case showed that the Bangladesh heist was not a single occurrence, “but part of a wider and highly adaptive campaign targeting banks.“  News of a second case comes as law enforcement authorities in Bangladesh and elsewhere investigate the February cyber theft from the Bangladesh central bank account at the New York Federal Reserve Bank. Swift has acknowledged that that scheme involved altering Swift software to hide evidence of fraudulent transfers, but that its core messaging system was not harmed. In both cases Swift said insiders or cyber attackers had succeeded in penetrating the targeted banks’ systems, obtaining user credentials and submitting fraudulent Swift messages that correspond with transfers of money.  In the second case SWIFT said attackers had also used a kind of malware called a “Trojan PDF reader” to manipulate PDF reports confirming the messages in order to hide their tracks.

Tens of thousands evacuated as Israeli wildfires rage
France, Russia, Turkey and Cyprus are to send firefighting planes to Israel as the country battles fierce forest fires that have triggered the evacuation of tens of thousands of people, including 11 neighbourhoods in Haifa. Strengthening east winds on top of warm, dry weather have helped spread the blazes in several areas of the country for a third day, including outside Jerusalem, where fires temporarily closed the main motorway linking the city to Tel Aviv. Haifa, however, was the worst affected, with fires starting out in the   of the port city near Paz Bridge and spreading to near the city’s football stadium. About 50, 000 people have been evacuated from the city as a precaution. Haifa’s civilian airport was closed on Thursday, while local media reported plans to evacuate prisons. “We evacuated three neighbourhoods and there are people who are stuck,” a fire department spokesman, Kayed Daher, said of the situation in Haifa earlier in the day. “The fire is still burning and the flames are approaching a gas [petrol] station. ” The fires are the worst since 2010, when Israel suffered its single deadliest wildfire it killed 42 people and was extinguished only after firefighting aircraft from as far away as the US were dispatched to bring it under control. The Palestinian Authority, which sent firefighters in 2010, has also offered to join the international effort to extinguish the blazes. The fires started on Monday in Neve Shalom, outside Jerusalem, before spreading. Hundreds of homes have been damaged and a dozen people treated for smoke inhalation. Despite claims by Israel’s security minister, Gilad Erdan, that 50% of the fires were “apparently arson” the Israel police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said investigators had not yet been able to determine whether any of the dozens of fires countrywide had been set deliberately.  The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said if proof was discovered that any of the fires were deliberately sparked they would be treated as acts of “terror”. “Every fire caused by arson or incitement to arson is terror and will be treated as such accordingly,” he told reporters in Haifa near the scene of the fires. Israel’s police chief, Roni Alsheich, told reporters that arsonists were suspected of setting some of the fires for political reasons. “It’s safe to assume that whoever is setting the fires isn’t doing it only out of pyromania,” he said. “If it is arson, it is politically motivated. ” Naftali Bennett, the leader of the     Jewish Home party, suggested on Twitter that arsonists were disloyal to the state, and that those who set the fires could not be Jewish. “Only those to whom the country does not belong are capable of burning it,” he said in a tweet in Hebrew.  Bennett provided no evidence to support his claims.

Late-night roasts Trump after debate: ’His head doesn’t have room for facts’
Among   TV hosts, the consensus on who won Monday night’s debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is resoundingly clear: Clinton dominated the evening, with Trump emerging as the blustering loser. The Daily Show, Late Night with Seth Meyers and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert all opted to air live following the first of three presidential debates, to offer comedic and pointed roundups of the chaotic clash. Trevor Noah’s Daily Show was the first up, with the host opening by taking a swipe at moderator Lester Holt, who New Yorker humorist Andy Borowitz mocked in a piece titled “CNN Launches Manhunt after Lester Holt Vanishes from Debate”. After playing a montage of the debate’s most heated exchanges, Noah said: “At that point, Lester Holt wasn’t even moderating anymore, he was just eating popcorn like everyone else. ”  Noah, however, saved most of his attacks for Trump, who still refused to release his tax returns, and instead boasted about his income while suggesting he was “smart” for not paying income tax. “I’m sorry, what?” Noah said appearing perplexed. “Dude, taxes are a responsibility, not something to evade. You’re running to be the number one citizen of a country. You shouldn’t brag about ways you found to get around the rules. You know who else found a way around the rules? OJ. No one likes him. ” Noah admitted that when the debate started, he didn’t think Trump was doing “a bad job”. “He was throwing the right punches, saying the right things,” said Noah. “But then the debate moved to foreign policy, and honestly, I was personally offended. ” Trump’s bizarre comparison of American airports to those in   countries was what eventually set Noah off. “Our airports are nicer than yours, Donald Trump,” the South African host said. “Don’t bring   countries into this shit, you hear me? Don’t involve us in your problems. ” Noah also made a point to call out Trump’s endless listing of his properties during the debate, quipping: “Donald Trump relates to America like he’s playing a game of Monopoly. ” As for Trump’s case of the sniffles, Noah suggested the Republican nominee was just “sniffing away all of the bullshit he was saying”. Colbert also weighed in on Snifflegate, joking during his segment that Trump “sounded like the   best man in the bathroom at a wedding”. Colbert kicked off his show by calling out the double standards presented by the debate. Clinton, he said, had to appear “confident but not smug, knowledgeable without being a    charming without being affected, commanding but not shrill, also likable, authoritative, warm and not coughing. Meanwhile, Donald Trump had to not commit murder  —   on camera. ” Elsewhere, Colbert deemed Clinton the better prepared of the two, dubbing her with the nickname Preparation H. “It’s a compliment!” Colbert claimed after some heckles from the audience. “In the primaries, she already proved she could soothe the Bern. ” He also drolly pointed out the debate’s first lie, showing a clip of Clinton greeting Trump graciously on stage with a “Donald, it’s good to be with you”. Lastly there was Meyers, who began by sending up the intense   to the debate. “The media hyped it like a prize fight,” said Meyers. After showing a spot that teased the debate as if it were the Super Bowl of politics, he quipped: “Based on that intro, you’d think the debate was taking place inside the UFC Octagon. ” Like Colbert, Meyers concluded that Trump appeared woefully underprepared compared to Clinton. Still, he expressed sympathy for the billionaire businessman. “His head doesn’t have room for facts and figures because it has to hold seven words,” he joked. Those words, shown in a dissection of Trump’s brain, read: Best, Huge, Ivanka, Big, Wall, Great and Tremendous.

Rio 2016: Mo Farah wins 10,000m gold, USA’s Henderson wins long jump – as it happened
That’s all from me. Join us tomorrow night for coverage of the men’s 100m final, among others.    manages a smile as she’s introduced to the crowd she gets a huge cheer. Ennis Hill starts quick and is 5m ahead after 100m. Thiam is trailing at the back but we expected that. The gap between the two is around 5. 5 seconds at 400m,   still leads the filed at 600m and Thiam is fading. It will be very close, she comes home in 2:08. I think Thiam has done just enough, she gave everything at the end and found the extra second or so she needed. It was a personal best from the Belgian.    and Thiam make their way onto the track for the final race of the heptathlon 800m. A reminder that   must beat Thiam by 9. 47 seconds in order to retain her title   and that’s the difference between their personal bests.  We’re waiting until the end of the medal ceremony of the 10, 000m, in which GB’s Mo Farah will receive gold, before we start the 800m heptathlon finale. Farah looks calm on the podium   he’s been there enough. The final heat of the heptathlon 800m now, and all the contenders are in action. The reigning champion, GB’sJessica   trails Belgium’s Nafissatou Thiam by 142 points. That’s the equivalent of 9. 47 seconds   around the difference of their personal bests.   is a good 800m runner but she’ll need to be at her very best to retain her title.  If you’re wondering what’s happened in the swimming tonight, you can check out our live updates here: The 2012 champion, Britain’s Greg Rutherford, has just spoken to the BBC after a fantastic long jump competition, in which he finished third with a leap of 8. 29m, but he admits that he was “gutted” with bronze not gold. “I’m very pleased I managed to pick myself up and pull out some   jumps, the one they called a foul they gave me in the end, it’s frustrating in a competition that would probably put me back in the lead for a while,” he said. “I never thought in my career I would be disappointed with bronze but I’m gutted. ” The London 2012 gold medallist even broke down in tears before adding: “I feel like I’m in shape to jump far, and it’s frustrating when you come out of something and you don’t feel you’ve done yourself justice. I didn’t see anyone out there who was unbeatable. I was down in fourth and I’ve managed to come out and get myself a medal, but I came into the championships to win, I’m not here to finish third and it’s very very frustrating. I gave it absolutely everything I could to take it back (the gold) I felt I could but it wasn’t to be. Two Olympic medals in my career isn’t too bad, but I really wanted it tonight, I really wanted to retain that title. ” The final event of the night now. The heptathletes drag themselves to the end of the road   a road that ends with an 800m run, which doesn’t seem very fair. The first heat doesn’t contain any of the contenders for gold. USA’s   wins by a huge distance but she won’t trouble top of the podium.  Is there a more aesthetically pleasing runner on earth than Kenya’s David Rudisha? He made a blistering 1. 43. 88sec seem like a training run in the 800m   that silky long stride eating up the Rio track. Rudisha looks unstoppable, but whether he can better his 1. 40. 91 world record from London 2012 is an open question. Clayton Murphy of the US road his   and produced the run of his life with a personal best of 1. 44. 30 to qualify for the final. Looking at the replay,   was level with Thompson until the latter stages when the new champion surged away. A great burst to clinch gold.   was the first to congratulate the woman who took her crown.  USA’s Tori Bowie won silver, coming from behind,   got bronze. Thompson looks shocked   she can’t believe what she’s done.    is away the fastest   she’s been here before so little surprise she knows exactly what to do. But it’s Thompson powering through and she hits the lead around 50m and doesn’t look back. Well, she does 30m after the finish line when she realises she has an Olympic gold medal.  Williams paces a few metres down the track before taking her mark. Everyone else paces near their blocks. Who looks the most pumped up? All of them.  And the finalists are out for the women’s 100m final. A reminder of the  .    (Jam) Schippers (Ned) Bowie (USA) Ahye (TT) Ta Lou (fastest loser) (CVI) Williams (fastest loser) (Jam) Thompson (Jam) Gardner (USA) The third 800m   now. The great David Rudisha goes in this one. The Kenyan and Souleiman are one and two going into the final lap. Rudisha accelerates away in the final stretch and USA’s Clayton Murphy follows him to make the final too.  The long jump discussions keep going. It appears Lawson’s left hand hit the pit first hence his 7. 78m final jump. So Henderson is champion, South Africa’s Manyonga second and GB’s Rutherford third.  The second 800m   is up now. Kenya’s Kipketer leads from the start and takes it ahead of USA’s Boris Berian.  What will Rutherford do now? He shakes out his arms as he prepares to jump. He is known for his ability to deliver under pressure. It’s close to a foul but he gets the white flag. It’s 8. 29m   enough for a bronze with just Jarrion Lawson of USA to jump. And it looks like he may have got it! Jeff Henderson grins as we wait. The official measurement is . .. 7. 78m?! They’re going to remeasure but at the moment Henderson is the champion.  USA’s Henderson has his final jump attempting to beat 8. 37m   and it’s a big one. And it’s 8. 38m   he leads by a single centimetre! Two athletes to go, including the reigning champion Rutherford.  The men’s 800m   are next. France’s Bosse wins the first semi, with Algeria’s Taoufik Makhloufi second.  Just sensational from Mo Farah, the first British athlete ever to win three gold medals on the track. If the true test of a great athlete is how they perform on the big occasion, then Farah is right up there with the very best. In the past, his rivals have failed to take him on as a team. They did tonight, but neither they nor a tumble could stop him. The moment when he hit the front was spine tingling and the atmosphere in a now pretty full stadium did it justice. Cue the Mobot, cavorting with a Union flag and all that. Samuel Jackon is a fan of Mo Farah: South Africa’s Manyonga is in control of the long jump at the moment. He makes a mark of 8. 37m and is heading for gold. Going into the 800m of the heptathlon, Thiam has extended her lead to 142 points.   is second. The reigning champion Greg Rutherford is currently in third and produces a big jump but he fouls. Just fouls. The TV replay looks like it was fine but Rutherford inspects the plasticine and doesn’t complain   must be the smallest of fouls. Farah takes his victory lap, he looks pretty serious. Not like the euphoria of his homes Games in London. He takes the Union Jack from a member of the crowd and wraps himself in it. He’s oddly subdued for a man who is usually so exuberant.  Farah looks over his shoulder as we enter the final lap. He has a narrow lead over Tanui, and Tanui breaks. Farah goes with him in the final 100. AND HERE COMES FARAH. He accelerates to victory. He is now one of the   greats   if he wasn’t already. Others fall to the ground in agony but Farah looks fine   the adrenaline no doubt pumping. The final lap was 55sec, no one can live with his pace in the final lap. Tanui got second and Tola was third.  600m to go and Farah is still in the lead but he can’t shake Tanui.  Farah is in the lead with two laps to go. Tanui is also up with him, Galen Rupp there too.  Four laps to go. Farah still with the leading pack. But Kamworor has been dropped and looks in trouble   surprising that he’s dropped already.  South Africa’s Manyonga is now in the lead in the long jump with an attempt of 8. 28m. Jessica Ennis Hill just looked distinctly unimpressed with her final javelin attempt, clasping her hands to her head as she threw the weakest of her three attempts at 42. 17. She’s looking at taking only 784 points out of this round.  Farah into   and his friend Galen Rupp is still in the race, which could help the Briton in the final stages. Kamwowor is first   the two favourites leading the race.  Eight laps to go and the Kenyans are pushing the pace. They can’t shake Farah though   it’s the fastest lap of the night   around 63 seconds.  More on Rupp tripping Farah, from Ian Prior at the stadium: Galen Rupp looked distinctly horrified after tripping his training partner Mo Farah. The American dropped back, waited for Farah to regain his footing and then tried to pace him back to the front of the race. Farah didn’t look quite the same for a lap but is now back tracking the leaders. What has that taken out of him? The pace of the 10, 000m is   certainly not fast enough to trouble Farah for now. Remember the champion has a huge advantage if the race is close near the end due to his finishing speed. But the Kenyans are starting to push at the front. Is this a move to break Farah? We have 4, 000m to go.  Jarrion Lawson of the US produces a big jump on his third attempt. He pumps his fist as the distance comes through   he leads Rutherford with an effort of 8. 25m. Ethiopia’s Tola is setting the early front but Farah is back in fifth and doesn’t look too troubled. Galen Rupp, Farah’s friend, manages to push the Briton to the floor, accidentally but the champion is up quickly and no damage done. Who needs enemies when you have friends like these? Farah has now moved up the field after 3, 000m   the Ethiopians and Kenyans know they have to break him early as they can’t live with his pace over the final lap. Farah is trying to stay with them.  Farah continues to lope along at the back of the pack in the 10, 000m. No one has attempted to make a break yet, which will suit Farah just fine.  Greg Rutherford is back into the lead in the long jump. His jump of 8. 22m puts him narrowly ahead of the field. Jess   the reigning Olympic champion, has her first effort in the women’s javelin. It’s 45. 91m   a good effort for someone who has struggled in the discipline in the past. But Belgium’s Nafissatou Thiam blasts her effort out beyond 50m. She rubs her elbow and looks to be in pain but she may not need to throw again after an effort like that.   looks worried, and she’s right to be.

Experience: my family’s hypochondria saved my life
Whenever we went on holiday, my mother always took a   kit packed with medicines, including cortisone injections, despite the fact that my father and I are only mildly allergic to bee stings. Our kitchen drawers at home in the Roman countryside resembled hospital cupboards: there were eight different aspirins from all over the world, 10 types of painkiller, bandages, antiseptic creams and adrenaline shots for the   scenarios my mother feared. I thought it was over the top, but, looking back, my family’s obsession with   saved my life. I had been taking penicillin for throat viruses from the age of four, so when the dentist prescribed antibiotics for an aching dental implant in the summer of 2006, when I was 32, I had no reason to worry. Three days later, over breakfast, I went to take one of the pills. I hadn’t even swallowed it, just put it in my mouth, when I started sneezing, scratching everywhere  —   armpits, groin, the back of my hands and feet my scalp felt as if it was on fire. I later learned that my body was rejecting the antibiotics and I had gone into anaphylactic shock. My lips started swelling  —   I looked like a grouper  —   and my dad shouted, “Oh my God!” I rushed to the mirror and saw that my lips and eyes had puffed up. I knew what was happening, and told my mum to inject me with cortisone. A week earlier, I had been out to dinner with my boyfriend and, even though he knew he is allergic to shrimps, he loves them too much not to eat them. He started to bloat like a balloon and told me to rush him to the hospital, where he was treated with a cortisone drip. Having seen his monstrous physical transformation, I recognised my own symptoms. By the time my mum injected the cortisone vial, I was slipping into darkness. My hands were shaking and I could hear my heart beating in my ears. My tongue and throat inflated, and I was suffocating. The cortisone was still working its way into my system. I have never been so scared. I clung on to my mum like a child, whispering, “I’m afraid, I’m afraid. ” I saw the terror reflected in her eyes. I passed out for a   falling on my knees and hitting my head on the cold, marble floor, which woke me up again. I opened my eyes, and it was like coming back from the grave. The cortisone had begun to work and I suddenly felt better. In the meantime, my dad had called an ambulance. A helicopter arrived, landing in a clear spot near my house. I knew I was out of danger, but the paramedics insisted on flying me to hospital. Later, the doctors explained why the reaction had been so fast and violent: I had accidentally sniffed the powdery coating of the antibiotic pill when I opened the bottle, so the penicillin entered my bloodstream through my nostrils much more quickly than it would have done if I’d ingested the pill. They said that if the cortisone hadn’t been to hand, I might have died. It took months to recover mentally. I stopped eating foods such as tomato sauce, chocolate and peanuts, scared I would react. At night, I’d wake with the feeling of suffocating. I had to see a psychiatrist, and had pharmacological tests to figure out which antibiotics I could safely take in future. Whenever I go out, I have four cortisone pills inside my purse. Doctors have told me that I am more susceptible to anaphylactic shocks than other people, and I can’t know if a substance or food will trigger one until it happens. It’s like living with a sword of Damocles over my head. I’m scared to take a simple aspirin, or of having an accident and being given antibiotics while I am unconscious. But I can laugh at it a bit, thinking about my   body transformation. And it has given me my nickname: Miss Grouper. • As told to Silvia Marchetti, • Do you have an experience to share?

When it comes to character, trust your ears
I used to buy weed from a guy who I’ll call Garrett. He was one of several “unlicensed pharmacists” I dealt with in those days. He got really good, potent pot that smelled like orange peels and Christmas trees and made your scalp tingle. The trouble was that you had to hang out with Garrett to get it. He lived in a dark terrarium of a basement apartment on the east side of Athens, Georgia. White as an underground mushroom, Garrett was always in the same spot on the couch facing a pair of   TV screens he’d parked side by side so he could play video games and watch daytime TV at the same time. The apartment itself wasn’t what made hanging out with Garrett such an ordeal, or even the competing blasts of sound, light and color coming from the two TVs. It was Garrett’s voice. Garrett is the only person I’ve known in real life who has what I call “Alex Jones voice” a sound somewhere between a bleat and a wail with a   slurry of gravel underneath. And, like Jones  —   the popular conspiracy theorist, “birther” nut and   howler monkey  —   Garrett seemed to live in a perpetual state of enraged grievance. Every time I visited it was the same, and yet it was always different. In a bawling tone like a wounded calf wailing from a ditch, Garrett would recount the latest   trick his   had pulled, the staggering amounts of money our other friends owed him for weed and cocaine and pills, the way the damn neighbors’ dog barks all day when they’re at work. I would sit there with smoke trailing from my mouth and nostrils, sinking lower and lower on the slightly   leather couch as I got bludgeoned by Garrett’s voluble swings between mawkish   and heated vows of revenge. It was enervating, exhausting, overwhelming. It occurred to me one day as I paid for my quarter bag and drove   and thoroughly demoralized back to my apartment in Normaltown that people’s voices are a song that we sing about ourselves to everyone we meet. And Garretts’s song was like a bombastic “modern classical” suite for orchestra, choir and  . I believe that our minds are often processing information at levels that we’re only dimly aware of, if at all. Our ears are often smarter than we are. Look at the recent controversy that has erupted over audio tape of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump bragging to Access Hollywood reporter Billy Bush about how his fame entitles him to kiss and grope women without their consent. For months we have known that Trump is a sexist and a braggart with an interior life that most probably resembles the decimated hellscape around Hiroshima’s ground zero on the day after the blast. We’ve read court depositions about how he treated his   Ivana. We’ve shuddered over transcripts of his conversations with Sirius XM shock jock Howard Stern. However, there is something entirely different about hearing the slimy, grasping   in his tone with Bush, his smugness and complete nonchalance about women’s personal space and agency. It makes the skin crawl and has led a segment of his followers and supporters to abruptly rediscover their gag reflex. There’s a certain delicious irony in Trump’s own horrible,      voice being the final thing that shuts him up and potentially derails any last fleeting hopes that he might expand his appeal beyond his angry, frothing base. We’ve seen this before, though. After years of faint signals on the horizon that actor Mel Gibson was coming unraveled, the world was treated to a   dose of his insanity when voice mails leaked of him threatening his ex Oksana Grigorieva. That’s what ended up killing his career. It was one thing to know intellectually that he was hitting the big mental   but when we heard the viciousness with which he spoke to Grigorieva, the bullying rage in his voice, the public rejected him on a visceral level. Similarly, former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling was known as a racist for decades and yet enjoyed a respectable reputation to the world at large. However, when audio leaked of Sterling castigating his girlfriend for appearing on social media with black people, the world reacted with revulsion. It was the mix of the petulance and contempt in Sterling’s wheedling, nasal rant that lit the fuse on the bomb that detonated his good standing before the world. As with Gibson and Trump, the world heard his voice and immediately remembered the   bully who tormented them, the fatuous high school   who unjustly punished them, the police officer who punched them in the face before shoving them into a squad car or the boss who made their work life a living hell. Our minds are constantly recording, measuring, analyzing. We recognize patterns and make associations. It’s how we learned to survive in this world, by keeping close track of what hurt us or made us sick in the past. Your voice is revealing more about you to the world than you realize. What are your lyrics? What kind of song are you singing?

SEIU, one of the largest US unions, plans 30% budget cuts in wake of Trump win
The    union that was a driving force behind the Fight for $15 minimum wage protests is planning to cut its internal budgets by 30% in anticipation of the Donald Trump administration, according to an internal memo. The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) president, Mary Kay Henry, has told staff that “[b]ecause the far right will control all three branches of the federal government, we will face serious threats to the ability of working people to join together in unions” and that cuts would start immediately, with a 10% budget reduction by this Saturday. News of the 14 December internal memo was first reported by Bloomberg on Tuesday. Trump’s triumph shocked the union. In the memo, obtained by the Guardian, Henry said “the outcome of the November 2016 election results” had made a it necessary to “dramatically rethink” the SEIU’s plans for expansion. In an emailed statement, an SEIU spokeswoman, Sahar Wali, told the Guardian that the planned cuts were necessary “as we prepare to fight back against the forthcoming attacks on working people and our communities under an   government”. Wali said that SEIU was looking for “financial refinements to implement” that would best allow the SEIU to grow. “Working families are fed up with not being able to improve their families’ lives no matter how hard or how long they work while greedy corporations and   politicians continue to rig our economy and political system,” Wali wrote. Last month the SEIU president joined the New York state attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, and others in denouncing Trump’s nominee for labor secretary, Andy Puzder. Puzder is the CEO of the restaurant group that owns Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr, two   chains he has broadly criticized minimum wage increases and advocated for automating jobs currently performed by   workers. The Fight for $15 campaign has achieved success in California and New York, and it has cut into the margins of the   industry from which Puzder hails. But there are other threats to the union, notably from rightwing legislatures pushing   laws.   activists managed to have a National    bill, sponsored by the Kentucky senator Rand Paul, introduced in February last year. It was referred to committee. Under a Trump administration and with Republican majorities in the House and the Senate, SEIU and others fear the return of a similar bill, which would eliminate unions by preventing them from charging dues or requiring membership.

Hillary Clinton calls Trump ’temperamentally unfit’ to lead after Machado spat
Hillary Clinton took another swipe at Donald Trump’s mental stability on Friday, declaring at a campaign stop in South Florida that the Republican nominee is “temperamentally unfit” for the White House. “Why does he do things like that?” Clinton demanded at a rally in Coral Springs, referring to Trump’s early morning   assault on former beauty queen Alicia Machado, which dominated the day’s political debate. “Who gets up at three o’clock in the morning to engage in a Twitter attack against the former Miss Universe?” Trump sent a string of tweets between 5. 14am and 5. 30am ET, alluding to unproven accusations against Machado, who became Miss Universe in 1996 when Trump owned part of the contest and who Clinton cited in an attack regarding Trump’s treatment of women during Monday’s first presidential debate. Trump also claimed Machado, originally from Venezuela, had been helped to become a US citizen so Democrats could use her against him. “I mean, his latest Twitter meltdown is unhinged, even for him,” Clinton said. “It proves, yet again, that that he is temperamentally unfit to be president and   .  “I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not be anywhere near the nuclear codes. ” Trump used Twitter on Friday to reply to criticism of his tweets and the hours at which they were sent by saying such nocturnal activities represented his willingness to work round the clock, writing: “For those few people knocking me for tweeting at three o’clock in the morning, at least you know I will be there, awake, to answer the call!” By Friday evening, Trump’s false accusations that Machado had a “sex tape” had already returned to haunt him, when Buzzfeed found that Trump had a cameo in an explicit video made in 2000. A Clinton campaign spokesman, Nick Merrill, told reporters: “There’s been a lot of talk about sex tapes today and in a strange turn of events only one adult film has emerged today and its star is Donald Trump. ” In two rallies in Florida, Clinton blended her attacks on Trump with new policy priorities, proposing at an earlier address in Fort Pierce a new national service reserve program for young Americans that appeared to be an attempt at winning back support among millennial voters. With recent polls showing the Democratic presidential nominee losing the confidence of voters under 30, and more than one in three planning to vote for a   candidate, Clinton offered students a pathway to paying down college debt in return for public service. “If you do national service, we will begin a program to forgive your loans because you are giving back to your country,” Clinton said, touching on themes of civic responsibility and renewing a “culture of service” among Americans of all ages, as well as declaring her intention to massively expand the AmeriCorps volunteer program. “I want to find more ways for more students to get college credit for service,” she said, “because I know too many talented, committed young people who pass up serving with AmeriCorps because, with their student loans, they can’t afford it. So let’s lighten that burden. ” Clinton, who was introduced in Coral Springs by a middle school civics teacher, also repeated a campaign pledge from earlier in the week, for free college tuition for children in     families. “If you are a family that makes less than $125, 000 you will not pay tuition to go to public college,” Clinton said, to cheers from a crowd of 2, 400 inside a small municipal gymnasium. “A college degree should not lead to being mired in debt. ” Students at the rally praised the new proposals. Emily Beth, 24, and Stav Berlin, 23, studying education management together at Palm Beach State College, said they were worried about taking on debt to finance their master’s degree studies in two years’ time, once their current course ends. “It’s a brilliant idea,” Berlin said. “Instead of paying back big corporations the money, we can pay it back by giving back to the community, rather than the Sallie Maes of the world that take and take and take. ” Beth, who will be voting in her second presidential election, said she liked that the volunteer work she already does tutoring children through the Literacy Coalition of Palm Beach could help pay off her college loans. “This country is drowning is student debt,” she said. “It’s a brilliant idea because the paying back is in the form of community service that’s positively going to impact our entire country. ” Another student, Mia Ulrich, 18, of Pompano Beach, said she hoped to study anthropology at Florida International University in Miami, but admitted: “I’ve been worried about how I’m going to pay for school. I like the community service aspect because then I’ve given back in an active way, not only to get what I need. ” In a part of her speech that resonated with the audience, Clinton demanded answers from Iran over the fate of Bob Levinson, 68, a Coral Springs resident, former FBI agent and private investigator who disappeared in 2007. The Levinson family believes he is being held hostage by or with the knowledge of the Iranian government.  “My heart goes out to Bob’s family,” Clinton said. “It’s time for Iran’s regime to provide information about his whereabouts. ” She also mentioned the death of Miami Marlins pitcher José Fernández, a popular   baseball star who was killed in a boating accident last weekend. She did not revisit a controversy from Thursday, in which her campaign seized on a Newsweek report that said Trump conducted business in contravention of the Cuba embargo in 1998. In a   address in Coral Springs, Clinton touched only briefly on several familiar policy themes, such as helping small businesses and equal pay for women. She did mentioned Monday’s first presidential debate. A   poll by   released on Friday showed her edging ahead of Trump in Florida, 46% to 42%. With 29 electoral college votes Florida is a key swing state, potentially pivotal on 8 November. Clinton promised many more visits in the 38 days left before the election.  “I’ll be here in Florida so much you’ll get sick of me,” she said at the conclusion of her speech. The Clinton campaign announced on Friday that President Obama, who won Florida by less than 75, 000 votes from Mitt Romney in 2012, will campaign in Miami next Wednesday.   Joe Biden will make appearances in Orlando and Sarasota on Monday. With the 11 October deadline for voter registration in Florida looming, Democrats are ramping up efforts to ensure a high turnout. In Broward County, of which Coral Springs is part, Clinton’s campaign has opened 10 field offices in recent weeks, to Trump’s three. Despite Broward being the “bluest” of Florida’s 67 counties, with 578, 000 registered Democrats to the 252, 000 Republicans, party strategists say every vote is crucial to counter the wide margin of victory Trump is expected to score in more rural counties, where populations are overwhelmingly white.

Barack Obama orders ’full review’ of possible Russian hacking in US election
Barack Obama has ordered US intelligence to review evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election after coming under sustained pressure from congressional Democrats. The review will be one of Obama’s final instructions to the intelligence agencies, which will soon report to Donald Trump, whom congressional Democrats consider the beneficiary of a hack targeting the Democratic National Committee. Lisa Monaco, the White House counterterrorism director, announced what she called a “full review” at a breakfast briefing sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor on Friday. At the White House press briefing later on Friday, Eric Schultz, the deputy White House press secretary, denied the review was “an effort to challenge the outcome of the election”.  “We have acknowledged who won the election,” he said. “It wasn’t the candidate the president campaigned for. He has gone out of his way to ensure a smooth transition of power. ” The review will span the last three presidential election cycles, Schultz told reporters. “These agencies will have to take a look at what we saw in 2008, 2012 and 2016. This is going to be a deep dive. This is a review that will be broad and deep at the same time. They’re going to look at where the activity leads them to look at. ” There were intrusions into both the Obama and John McCain campaigns in 2008, publicly attributed to the Chinese, he continued, and although there were no notable incidents in 2012, “knowing what we know now” that election will also be scrutinised.  In 2016, he said, the government did not detect any increased cyber activity on election day itself but the FBI made public specific acts in the summer and fall, tied to the highest levels of the Russian government. “This is going to put that activity in a greater context . .. dating all the way back to 2008. ” Asked if the review would investigate Russia’s motives, Schultz replied: “Malicious cyber activity, specifically malicious cyber activity tied to our elections, has no place in the international community. Unfortunately this activity is not new to Moscow. We’ve seen them do this for years . .. The president has made it clear to President Putin that this is unacceptable. ” Obama expected the review to be completed before he leaves office, Schultz said. “This is a huge priority . .. I think the president wanted this done under his watch because he takes it very seriously. This is something the president has been watching closely for eight years now. ” Schultz also told the briefing: “We’re going to make public as much as we can. As you can imagine, something like this might include sensitive and even classified information. When that report is submitted we’re going to take a look. We want to brief Congress and the relevant stakeholders, possible state directors. ” “This is good news. Declassifying and releasing information about the Russian government and the US election, and doing so quickly, must be a priority,” said Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee. In October, the director of national intelligence and the secretary of homeland security publicly accused the “ ” levels of the Russian government of directing those digital breaches. Trump, who has treated Russian president Vladimir Putin with a warmth unequalled by most US politicians, has repeatedly dismissed the accusation as politically motivated. US intelligence laid the blame for the DNC hack at Russia’s feet but has not provided evidence supporting the accusation, although several private cybersecurity firms reaching the same conclusion have. Earlier this month, all the Democratic members of the Senate intelligence committee publicly intimated the administration knows significantly more about Russian culpability than the October statement revealed, and implored Obama for a public disclosure he has thus far resisted.  Yet the White House was more sympathetic to a request earlier this week from several senior Democrats in the House of Representatives, who wrote to Obama requesting a classified briefing on the role the Russians played in the election.  While Democrats, stung by a rout in an election many expected to win, have spearheaded the calls for disclosure of Russian interference, they also have some Republican support. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina hawk who savaged Trump on the campaign trail, told CNN this week he will use his Senate perch to pursue an investigation of Russian involvement in the DNC hack.  According to Monaco, the review will be classified and delivered to lawmakers before Obama leaves office on 20 January.  Democrats immediately pounced on the announced review and pressed the White House to declassify it before Trump takes office. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said Russia had “succeeded” in “sow[ing] discord” in the election, and urged as much public disclosure as is possible. “More than that, the administration must begin to take steps to respond forcefully to this blatant cyber meddling, and work with our allies in Europe who have been targets of similar attacks to impose costs on the Kremlin if we do not, we can expect to see a lot more of this in the near future,” Schiff said Friday. A spokesman for the director of national intelligence declined to comment.

Colin Kaepernick’s critics are ignoring the target of his protest
A few nights ago the University of Florida law professor Katheryn Russell‑Brown watched four commentators on ESPN debate Colin Kaepernick’s refusal to stand for the United States national anthem. For several minutes the men argued about whether the San Francisco 49ers quarterback was right in using the anthem to shed a light on racial inequities in their country. They spoke of soldiers away at war, veterans who died and the meaning of the US constitution. The debate raged until   finally realised the one thing they had not discussed were the issues about which Kaepernick is protesting. What happened to talking about police brutality, profiling and racial inequality, she wondered. Was not the whole reason he said he was not standing during the anthem to start a conversation about race in America? “This discussion, however, masks the fact that most of the negative responses to his protest are a reaction to the subject matter and the message of his dissent, not the form of his protest,”   said. “The people who object to his form of speech are really saying, ‘I don’t agree that these are nationally significant issues’. ” Three weeks have passed since Kaepernick first sat through the anthem before a Niners   game and the national debate is more about his choice of protest than the issues it raised. Every day brings a fresh batch of stories about who is supporting Kaepernick by kneeling or sitting through the anthem and then each of those expressions of solidarity is washed through its own news cycle. There seems almost more discussion about the former quarterback Trent Dilfer’s suggestions that Kaepernick is not fulfilling some mythical duty as backup quarterback to be silent on all matters than there is about police shootings. Critics have furthermore cloaked themselves in patriotism as a pretence to undermine Kaepernick’s voice, brushing aside his actions as a self‑serving stunt, either misguidedly or deliberately casting it as a protest against the military or, even worse, suggesting his personal fortune invalidates his perspective. Is this really what Kaepernick had in mind when he said: “I’m going to stand with the people that are being oppressed. To me this is something that has to change. When there’s significant change and I feel that flag represents what it’s supposed to represent  —   this country representing people the way that it’s supposed to. ” Mark Anthony Neal, a professor of African and African‑American studies at Duke, said: “I would argue that it’s by [Kaepernick’s] design. The flag piece is a Trojan horse. The mainstream media never really has interest in these issues until it becomes a spectacle. ” By shocking people with his anthem protest Kaepernick was getting everybody’s attention, forcing people to confront the uncomfortable issues that many people have either ignored or never understood. The issue now, is how can Kaepernick and other athletes continue to push that conversation? Will it stagnate into a daily tally of Kaepernick supporters and dissenters or can there be a new level of athlete activism? Over the years Neal has had many black athletes in his classes at Duke and he is always struck by how eloquent and thoughtful they are about race in their private work and also how reluctant they are to share those ideas in class. He senses that they have been conditioned through sports to think this way, trained by their coaches to shy away from any expressions that might detract from their athletic mission. But he also senses a new athlete activism, one started last fall when the University of Missouri football team struck in support of   students trying to change the university’s culture. The success Missouri’s players had in ousting the school’s president has shown other athletes the power of their voices. As the Denver Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall, who knelt during the anthem before his team’s first   game, wrote in a first‑person essay in the Denver Post: “Now I have a tremendous platform, so when I do have conviction about these issues, I know the right thing to do to use it. ” In addition to the Missouri protest athletes have been emboldened by basketball players like LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony, whose comment for the Guardian called on players to talk about social issues. But he also thinks Muhammad Ali’s death this summer awakened an awareness in many athletes. Until he died a lot of them did not know he refused to fight in the Vietnam War and was squeezed out of boxing for more than three years in the prime of his career because of it. Hearing of how he stood up to racial oppression opened their eyes. “Many of them have started to ask, how will I be judged years from now?” Neal said. Things were different in the years after Ali first spoke about race. Black athletes were emboldened to protest in those days and often did. The former NBA star Marques Johnson, who now Milwaukee Bucks games on television, remembers that his college coach at UCLA, John Wooden, had the team stay in the locker room for the national anthem because he knew most of the players would not stand for the song. “We were aware of [the anthem author] Francis Scott Key being a racist,” Johnson said. “We knew about the missing third stanza that criticises the slaves who joined the British Army so they could be free. I think we were aware of all of that. ” But something happened in the following years. The players who were moved to protest also saw how wealthy NBA stars were becoming. They noticed how Julius Erving, better known as Dr J, was celebrated for his   corporate image and they wanted to be more like him. Their zeal for protest waned. Speaking out became a sin. Once, in the early 1980s, Johnson had become so tired of hearing the media complain that the NBA was losing popularity because it did not have enough white stars, he bought a Halloween mask of a white man that he was going to wear during   before a game. Eventually he lost his nerve. He worried that it would affect his contract negotiations. Now he wonders if the current athletes have become so wealthy they feel empowered to speak out: Kaepernick, he notes, is well into a contract that guarantees him $60m. “When you have that kind of financial clout behind you those are some pretty good chips to fall back on,” he said. “But a part of that is the more financially comfortable you are means you have the means to take a stand and address some social ills. ” What’s most alarming is that many of the same voices who extolled Ali on his death in June are Kaepernick’s most strident critics. The uncomfortable truth is Ali’s   journey from White America’s most hated man to its most beloved coincided with the decline of his health. Only when he was infirm and ravaged by disease  —   when he was no longer the threat to order that he was as the handsome and virile icon of unapologetic blackness and safely removed from the present was he embraced by broader society. Martin Luther King wrote in his famous letter from Birmingham jail that it was not radicals or extremists who represented the greatest threat in the fight for justice but those whose pleas for order  —   like those angrier at Kaepernick’s actions than what it signifies  —   derailed the struggle. “I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner,” he wrote, “but the white moderate who is more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice who constantly says ‘I agree with you in the goal you seek but I can’t agree with your methods of direct action’ who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man’s freedom who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ‘more convenient season’. ” Never have those words rung truer as the movement launched by Kaepernick struggles to take flight, nor has the mountaintop seemed further from reach. But if enough athletes continue to draw attention to the racial iniquities present in every strata in American life, they cannot be silenced forever.

Iceland Airwaves festival day four – Björk’s the star in her home country
Iceland Airwaves may not have the AR reputation of South by South West or CMJ, but it does offer as wide a variety of new music as any festival, both local and international (with an obvious focus on Icelandic and Scandinavian talent). And the bookers deserve a mention because they’ve ensured that wherever you alight, at whichever of the dozen or so venues in town (with a couple on the outskirts) you’re bound to find something of interest. You could almost see it as a festival made in the image of the nation’s totemic individualist and experimentalist, Björk. Saturday is virtually a showcase for potential Björk collaborators. There is Bára Gísladóttir, an Icelandic composer and double bassist who has performed with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra and isa member of the   composers’ collective Errata. Her performance is both arthouse  —   a woman sawing away at her instrument with little attention paid to such niceties as accessibility and melody  —   and thrilling. She does to the double bass what Hendrix did to the electric guitar, using it to coax out thrillingly strange new sounds. There is a laptop, too, so it’s hard to ascertain precisely the provenance of all those faintly disturbing noises, but in one song alone they variously approximate the creak of a door in a haunted house and the wheeze of a pensioner gasping for breath. Equally far out on the lunatic fringe is Hermigervill, a quirky, bearded gentleman who employs a mix of analogue gadgetry andcomputers. At one point he hovers his hand over what sounds like a Stylophone and, without actually touching it, gets it to play: think Uri Geller meets the Aphex Twin. But it’snot all novelty trickery. One of his songs, Thorparinn, is fantastic throbbing instrumental disco, a distant cousin of Space’s Magic Fly. When he invites onstage another bearded chap in an equally unflattering   jumper to sing over one of his tunes, it’s like attending a rave put on by two Open University professors from 1975. He ends his set with a track that is equal parts dub and technopop, like Yello stuck in a Swiss studio with King Tubby. Björk would love surely love Kelsey Lu, an   from North Carolina who has worked with Blood Orange, Kelela, Wet and Organized Noize. Her debut EP, Church, was recorded live in Brooklyn’s Holy Roman Catholic Church and she immediately creates a hushed, reverent atmosphere somewhere between a conservatoire and a cathedral. Sh estands on a fur rug and, in the     uses her instrument, and a loop pedal, to create chamber pop backdrops for her gorgeous voice. She seems vulnerable and troubled, singing about “broken promises”  —   standard   tropes, perhaps, but afforded a new potency in these startling contexts. She sings a song about her late grandmother who struggled with Alzheimers and, eavesdropping on this moment of private grief, it is unspeakably plaintive. SG Lewis, a labelmate of Disclosure and Jessie Ware, is the perfect act for the midnight hour with his luscious dance music and (not a contradiction in terms, this) soulful,    . There’s a real live drummer, someone   the warm sound of a Rhodes piano on a keyboard, and Lewis himself straps on a bass at one point for a set that gives commercial dance music a good name. Gunnar Jónsson Collider blends ambient electronica and   drones, joining the dots between two different eras of psychedelic exploration. There are lots of people sitting down for his set, but it’s not all stoned abstraction for supine satisfaction. Flanked by a guitarist and drummer, he plays one song that is quite catchy in a shoegaze way.  In Valshöllin, an aircraft hangar on the edge of town, Denmark’s Emil Stabil and his hype man do their level best to whip up a sparse crowd. Their uniformly slow   reflects the pace of the American variety, and that’s OK, but it would be nice, especially given the parlous state of the planet, to have some urgent radical rap right now produced by a 21st century Bomb Squad. Reykjavik’s Þriðja Hæðin, a   throwback who come onstage to LL Cool J’s Mama Said Knock You Out, bring some cartoon energy to their performance.  To judge by the buzz on the bus to the venue, you’d think Odd Future were about to break, not fast becoming a distant memory. Odd Future offshoot the Internet capitalise on that good feeling, preparing to party like it’s 2009 with their musicianly take on modern RB  —   machines are kept to a minimum, the jazzy chords and subtle rhythms courtesy of players who appear to worship at the altar of 70s and 80s soul, the   machine variety. With her   and outsize workshirt, Syd tha Kyd subverts the soul lothario persona (Ego Death, the Internet’s latest album, is virtually a gay Let’s Get It On) but her voice is as sweet as, say, Kelela’s or indeed any of the new RB starlets, from Tink to Tinashe. Back at the Harpa concert hall, Let’s Eat Grandma acquit themselves well before a big crowd, with their intimations of ritual and pagan strangeness. In their matching shiny black trouser suits with silver snake designs, they evoke the magic and mystery of childhood and remind you that, for primal reasons unknown, the sight of   young females standing together can be more than a little unsettling. Epic Rain are a local   featuring harp, double bass and other instrumentation used in the service of their odd mixture of   languid lounge noir and dark cabaret. Over spaghetti   guitar, their tattooed rapper, Bragi, sounds like Tom Waits doing an impression of Lee Van Cleef as sepia images of Iceland appear on the screen behind the stage.   ethereal electronic RB outfit Gangly suggest the xx (and the Weeknd, and James Blake) should be on some sort of commission points system. Björk actually kicked things off on Saturday, at 5pm, with her show of two halves: one set of orchestrated reworkings of her 2015 album Vulnicura, and a second set of   “hits”. For the first she wore a red puffy dress and matching shoes and headdress, but really the mood was blue, although Vulnicura is an autopsy of her relationship with Matthew Barney, so maybe the colour did make sense. This was   Björk, singing sweetly these sometimes sour scenes from a marriage, the alternately swelling and stabbing strings and weeping violins conjuring mournfulness and melodrama. It is to her credit that she managed to make Vulnicura  —   her Blood on the Tracks if not her Berlin or Sister Lovers  —   a viable commercial attraction, giving shape and order to the emotional tumult, to these snippets of words said in anger (“You betrayed your own heart   corrupted that organ”) and anguished cries about the destruction of a family. She created intimacy in an immense space. After the interval, the mood was lightened somewhat as Björk returned for renditions of Jóga and Bachelorette, for which she wore what looked like an extraterrestrial burka. Of course she did. Shame she couldn’t have caught Dream Wife, who were offering similar insights into the rules and roles of relationships in an upstairs bar on the other side of town. Variously from Reykjavik, London and Brighton, a riot of   hair and   gear, these three grrrls (and token drummerbloke) in a set made to look like a kitsch retro lounge, were all sound and fury signifying loathing for the patriarchy  —   and suddenly, with events unfolding in the States, the stakes have been raised and such sentiments have renewed relevancy. On F. U. U. Dream Wife chanted, “Gonna fuck you up, gonna cut you up,” teasing out the nastiness, relishing the taste of the inflicted pain. The joy on their faces was unconfined. Ours, too.

RG3’s recklessness may have cost him the last great chance of his career
If there was a play that said everything about what Robert Griffin III’s career would become, it was one the block he threw in the shadows of his first NFL game, far from the cameras and prying eyes in the stands. Few in the New Orleans Superdome that day in September 2012 noticed when Washington’s new quarterback inexplicably ran ahead of   Alfred Morris and knocked the Saints’ Roman Harper to the ground. But it should have been warning for the weeks and years to come. And for a football life that might be finished. Only Griffin couldn’t understand that at the time. “Cut him,” he said after the game, still beaming at the memory. He and Harper tussled after the play. Quarterbacks don’t block safeties in the NFL and Harper didn’t care much for Griffin’s hit. They had words in that     way that football players do, and then RG3 went back to the congratulations of his new teammates. “It shows he’s a football player,” Washington linebacker London Fletcher said that day. “That block shows he’s willing to sacrifice himself for the team. ” But it was also an alarming sign of a disaster to come. While RG3’s plunging knockdown of Harper might have sent hearts thumping on the Washington bench, it showed a recklessness, a need to prove his toughness through the kind of contact a quarterback should not want. It was the kind of thing he could never eliminate from his game, despite the pleas of too many coaches. Now it may have cost him the last great chance of his career. On Monday, the Cleveland Browns placed Griffin on injured reserve after he broke a bone in his   shoulder on a play late in the team’s   loss at Philadelphia. This means he will be out at least eight weeks and with Cleveland already looking to the future, his chances of playing for the Browns again are slim. If this really is the end for RG3, he will be finished not for his exuberance, or his struggles to master a   game, but rather his refusal to keep from getting hit. His brief NFL run has been filled with blows that have bent his knee, ripped ligaments and shaken his brain. Each time his coaches screamed that he needed to slide away from tackles or dash out of bounds. They said he wasn’t built like Cam Newton or Colin Kaepernick. They told him his wiry, hurdler’s frame wasn’t made to take football contact game after game. Each time he nodded and said he understood. Then he’d go in a game and get himself hit again. Who knows why he never changed. Maybe he couldn’t. Maybe he had built himself into so much of a running and passing sensation at Baylor, winning the 2011 Heisman Trophy, that he couldn’t be anything else. His speed got him though college and made him the NFL’s rookie of the year in 2012. Perhaps running was all he knew and no level of good sense was going to teach him otherwise. Lord knows everyone tried. After he tore his ACL in college, his father attempted to change him, propping him on a stool with his bandaged leg in a parking lot and ordering him to throw pass after pass to build his arm strength. In Washington, his first coach, Mike Shanahan, begged him to be more like the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson, who is masterful at dodging contact. His next coach at Washington, Jay Gruden, asked the same thing. As did Hue Jackson in Cleveland. Their pleas never worked. Griffin kept taking the shots. Sunday’s hit was like so many of the others in his past. RG3 had taken off running, trying to stretch for extra yards, when he ran straight into Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills, who met Griffin’s shoulder with his own. When they got back up, it was Griffin’s shoulder, not Mills’s that dangled limply from under his pads. Ironically, Mills is a rookie from LSU, playing his college football just an hour from New Orleans, where Griffin made that block the first day of his career. Maybe it is fitting that a player from Louisiana might be the one to finish Griffin’s time in the NFL. It will be sad if this is the end for Griffin. Few NFL players have ever been as interesting or willing to share themselves with the public. He might have confounded many because he never fit a stereotype for an NFL quarterback both on the field and off, but that was also his charm: he was not a football robot. He couldn’t do the one thing he had to, however. He couldn’t avoid a hit. From that first block in New Orleans to that last blow in Philadelphia, he kept getting himself knocked to the turf. Why couldn’t he listen to good advice when it was given? Before it was too late?

Donald Trump will violate the US constitution on inauguration day
When Donald Trump swears at the inauguration that he will “faithfully execute the office of president of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the constitution of the United States” he will be committing a violation of constitutional magnitude.  The US constitution flatly prohibits any “Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under [the United States]” from accepting “any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State”.  Known as the emoluments clause, this provision was designed on the theory that a federal officeholder who receives something of value from a foreign power can be tempted to compromise what the constitution insists be his exclusive loyalty: the best interest of the United States. The clause applies to the president and covers even ordinary, fair market value transactions with foreign states and their agents that result in any profit or benefit. That a hostile government has gotten its money’s worth from our president is obviously no defense to a charge that he has abused his office.   Trump’s continued interest in the Trump Organization and his steady stream of monetary and other benefits from foreign powers put him on a collision course with the emoluments clause. Disentangling every improper influence resulting from special treatment of Trump’s business holdings by foreign states would be impossible. The American people would be condemned to uncertainty, leaving our political discourse rife with accusations of corruption. These problems are exacerbated by the fact that Trump has regularly declined to make his business dealings or tax returns transparent. Thus a specter of skewed incentives will haunt a Donald Trump presidency.  While much has changed since the constitution was written, certain premises of politics and human nature have held steady. Among them is that private financial interests can subtly sway even the most virtuous leaders. As Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist 22: “One of the weak sides of republics, among their numerous advantages, is that they afford too easy an inlet to foreign corruption. ” The framers sought to avoid these ends by avoiding these beginnings, writing a broad ban on potentially corrupting foreign influence into article I of our nation’s charter. By imposing clear limitations, the clause avoids situations in which the American people must search for hints of improperly motivated presidential favoritism toward selected foreign powers, or of foreign attempts to seduce the American president into compromising our national interest for his private profit.   With Trump, this search has already begun. His global business empire creates ideal conditions for ongoing violations of the emoluments clause. Mere weeks before Trump spoke by phone with the president of Taiwan  —   a dramatic departure from America’s “one China” policy  —   a businesswoman associated with his conglomerate reportedly arrived in Taiwan to inquire about major new investments in luxury hotels. Trump’s businesses owe hundreds of millions to Deutsche Bank, which is currently negotiating a   settlement with the US Department of Justice  —   a settlement that will now be overseen by an attorney general selected by and serving at the pleasure of Trump.  In his last public press conference, Trump called on Russia to hack Hillary Clinton and release her personal emails. Recently, both the FBI and CIA determined that the highest levels of Russia’s government in fact ran a covert operation aimed at helping Trump’s campaign, making his victory in the electoral college more likely.  The bottom line is simple: Trump stands to benefit personally, in innumerable and largely hidden ways, from decisions made daily by foreign governments and their agents. History teaches that leaders with divided interests cannot be counted on to faithfully serve those who elected them.  The framers understood this lesson. The emoluments clause was forged of their   wisdom. No relic of a bygone era, it is a profound expression of insight into the nature of the human condition and the preconditions of sovereign  .  Trump’s shifting proposals for addressing his multifarious conflicts of interests are simply inadequate. If he retains an ownership interest in his empire, his personal bottom line is necessarily affected by everything his business does, whether or not he is at the helm. Nor is a supposedly “blind trust” involving control of Trump’s assets by his adult children remotely sufficient. It is inconceivable that he could avoid discussing with them at least some matters relating to his policies and their business ventures, or that he could avoid noticing and caring about their interactions with foreign nations.  So even full divestment of his personal ownership and control of the Trump Organization is no remedy for his emoluments clause violation: it is often to the prince and not the king that special favors are done.  Because Trump would take office in blatant violation of the constitution, the electoral college would be fully justified in concluding that he is unsuited to the presidency. As Justice Robert Jackson wrote 64 years ago, electors must be considered free to vote their conscience.  If Trump deliberately declines to cure his continuing violation of the emoluments clause upon entering office, Congress has both power and responsibility to enforce the constitution. It would be well within its rights to impeach and remove him for engaging in “high crimes and misdemeanors”.  Short of that awesome step, Congress might set lasting, bipartisan precedent by requiring all presidents to divest assets that risk conflicts of interest and to place the proceeds in a truly blind trust, and by creating a private cause of action explicitly allowing competitors disadvantaged by the president’s acceptance of unlawful benefits to file emoluments clause suits against the president in his personal capacity.  The looming constitutional shadow cast by a Trump presidency poses a frightening risk to our national security and gravely disserves the people of the United States.

Bikers for Trump at Republican national convention: ’We’re part of a movement’
David is worried about my ability to knock him out, despite the fact he’s carrying a loaded pistol holstered to his belt. “If you were a bad guy right now and you wanted to punch me in the mouth and knock me out with the   ‘knock out game’  —   who’s there to do anything about it for me?” he says, striding toward a large rally supported by his organization, Bikers for Trump, a   vigilante collective of veterans and law enforcement supporters from across America.  Although Cleveland is the most fortified city in America at the moment, with thousands of police, FBI and secret service agents securing the Republican national convention, David  —   who won’t give me his last name but says he is from Minnesota  —   worries about “agitators” and “thugs” who make him feel unsafe. “We [Bikers for Trump] protect the police as much as the police protect us,” he claims.  But many officers in Cleveland would likely disagree with David’s assessment. On Sunday, following the fatal shooting of three law enforcement officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the head of the city’s largest police union, Steve Loomis, called on Ohio governor John Kasich to temporarily rescind the right to open carry in the city, arguing those who did jeopardized the safety of officers.  “It’s irresponsible of those folks  —   especially right now  —   to be coming downtown with open carry AR [assault rifle]s or anything else. I couldn’t care less if it’s legal or not,” Loomis said.  Following the deaths of five police officers at a protest march in Dallas earlier in the month, local officials expressed frustration that up to 20 marchers had open carried during the protest, leading to widespread confusion during the massacre over how many people had opened fire. For Bob Posatiere Sr, 61, another Bikers for Trump member and a former Cleveland Metro Park police officer, this frustration should never supersede a constitutional right to carry.  “If that’s our right, that’s our right,” he says, after pointing out that his pistol is holstered out of sight for discretion, and saying it will protect me and him from any unseen threats at this peaceful rally.  Fear of the unknown is a common theme at this very white, very male Citizens for Trump rally, organized by the former Nixon adviser and Trump strategist Roger Stone.  Alex Jones, the noted conspiracy theorist and operator of the Infowars website, repeatedly condemns the “liberal media” without really articulating what he means. He accuses Hillary Clinton of being a “foreign agent” for the Chinese and Saudi Arabian government, without citing anything close to evidence.  “We’re sick and tired of what we’ve been seeing, that’s why we want Donald Trump,” Jones screams, as members of the crowd call out that Clinton is a “reptile” and a “bitch” and chant “Hillary for Prison”. “It’s powerful, it’s exhilarating,” says Daryl Rembowski, a    Bikers for Trump member from Cleveland. “He [Jones] is a true American. He stands for truth and he’s exposing the lies. ”  He adds: “We’re part of a movement, yeah. This is definitely making history. ”  While the threats may not be visible here, and police arrested just one person on Monday in connection with protests at the RNC, many Bikers for Trump members speaking to the Guardian pointed to one particular group, Black Lives Matter, as a tangible example of the need to remain vigilant.  Despite leaders of the movement, who are credited with igniting a new civil rights movement throughout the US, repeatedly denouncing violence, various Bikers for Trump members described the nebulous organization as a “terrorist threat” and a “hostile group”.  None had time for the argument, frequently articulated since the fatal police shooting of African American teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, that state violence in America is disproportionately meted out to black people.  “I don’t know why you people think that cops wake up one day and say ‘well I’m going to shoot somebody’,” says    Dave Lenley, who rode all the way from London, Kentucky. “Do you realize that ruins that person’s life? Aside from the one that got killed, that officer’s life has been ruined, whether he’s black, white, Hispanic or what. They [officers] don’t wake up one day and say: ‘I think I’m going to shoot me black person. ’”  Had Lenley seen the video of unarmed African American Walter Scott, shot five times from behind as he ran away from white North Charleston officer Michael Slager?  Yes, Lenley said, but added: “Why was he running away? The police officer told him to stop. If I tell you to stop, stop. ”

’We are protectors, not protesters’: why I’m fighting the North Dakota pipeline
Our elders have told us that if the zuzeca sape, the black snake, comes across our land, our world will end. Zuzeca has come  —   in the form of the Dakota Access pipeline  —   and so I must fight. I am   Lakota, born in Rosebud, South Dakota, and writing from the frontline of the movement against the pipeline in Cannon Ball. I have been holding this ground with my Standing Rock Sioux tribe relatives since the spring. I am defending the land and water of my people, as my ancestors did before me. The $3. 8bn pipeline project is proposed to carry approximately 470, 000 barrels per day of fracked oil from our Bakken oil fields, 1, 172 miles through the country’s heartland, to Illinois. The pipeline will cross the confluence of the Cannonball and Missouri rivers, where it threatens to contaminate our primary source of drinking water and damage the bordering Indigenous burial grounds, historic villages and sundance sites that surround the area in all directions. Those sites that were not desecrated when the area was flooded in 1948 by the construction of the Oahe dam are now in danger again. This week, I have witnessed pipeline construction tear its way toward the waters of the Missouri river which flow into the Mississippi, threatening to pollute the aquifer that carries drinking water to 10 million people. I have seen where their machines clawed through the earth that once held my relatives’ villages. I have watched law enforcement officials protect the oil industry by dragging away my indigenous brothers and sisters who stood up for our people. The fact that Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the pipeline, would use the word “Dakota” which means “friend” or “ally” in the name of its project is disrespectful. This pipeline is a direct threat to all Dakota, Lakota and Nakota people, especially our future generations. And we are not the only ones. We know that burning this oil is changing our climate and Indigenous people all over the world are bearing the brunt of the catastrophes that causes. This pipeline poses threats strikingly similar to those posed by the now defeated Keystone XL, but has received a fraction of the attention from mainstream media and big environmental groups. On 26 July, we were surprised to learn that the North Dakota permits were approved by the US Army Corps of Engineers to run the pipeline within a   of our reservation. My tribal leaders have said that this done without consulting tribal governments, and without a meaningful study of the impacts it will have. This is a violation of federal law and, more importantly, of our treaties with the US government  —   the supreme law of the land. It was my Ina, my mother, who first told me of this struggle. With my Ina, ciye (older brother) and tunwin (aunt) we have joined our Standing Rock relatives to face this new storm. For the past month, we have stood with Standing Rock in solidarity, we have prayed, we have cried, and we have also laughed, even when we thought it impossible to do so. I never thought I would be on the frontline of a fight like this. I grew up admiring Crazy Horse, Sitting Bull, and my ancestor American Horse, for their courage and leadership in battle against their oppressors. Now I am fighting alongside their descendants, my relatives from all seven tribes, against the very same oppressors.  It saddens me that the government time and time again continues to ravage my people with the same treatment and attitude, only different weapons. But why should be surprised? This is the definition of insanity  —   to go through the same situations over and over believing the outcome will be different. This camp was created as a last defense for the water that our communities depend on to survive. I have watched our numbers dwindle down to the single digits, and now we have swelled to over 300 people in just a few days. Hundreds more are on the way right now, as other tribes gather resources to send people and supplies. This historic battle is bringing the Oceti Sakowin together like nothing has ever before. The Hunkpapa, the tribal band of Standing Rock, are now joined by the Oglala from Pine Ridge, the Sicangu from Rosebud, and relatives from Crow Creek, Cheyenne River, and Yankton, as well as Dine and Ponca relatives from the south, Ojibwe relatives from the Great Lakes, and countless others. From all across the country, tribes are bringing us shelter, food and most importantly, prayers. To have all this unity of tribes standing together in solidarity before my eyes is a beautiful sight. Our tribes now live together, eat together, and pray together on the front lines. We are not protesters. We are protectors. We are peacefully defending our land and our ways of life. We are standing together in prayer, and fighting for what is right. We are making history here. We invite you to stand with us in defiance of the black snake.

Thunder play ugly brilliantly as they shock Warriors in conference finals
This year’s NBA playoffs have found their villain now, thumping into the title holders with frosty glares. The Oklahoma City Thunder became the bad guys of the postseason when they broke up what was probably Tim Duncan’s last championship run. And now they are trying to ruin the Golden State Warriors’ joy. OKC swaggered onto the Warriors floor Monday night no longer the young, happy team of a few years back but gruff outsiders scarred by disappointments and looking to stomp on sunshine. There’s nothing fun about this Oklahoma City team. Almost an afterthought in Steph Curry’s Western Conference, the Thunder have remade themselves as a rugged spoiler of pretty basketball, ready to shove, elbow or wrestle their way to a victory. This is what makes them the most serious threat to the Warriors’ dance to a second straight title. They lug with them a world of resentment with nothing to lose    —   a lethal combination in playoff basketball. “I mean we hear it all the time, defense wins games,” Oklahoma City forward Kevin Durant said in a leaden, passionless voice after the Thunder’s   victory over the Warriors in the first conference final game. The team that was supposed to be the Warriors’ latest victim on their march to the next title will not go quietly. All those beautiful passes, skipping shots and delicate player movements that dazzled the NBA this season do not impress a core of Oklahoma City players all these years on. The Thunder use words like “resilient” and “focus,” which usually fill the dreary, heavy talk of a team that looks at the playoffs as a long, tedious slog of games to be endured rather than won. In Game 1 they forced Golden State to rush perfection. Their aggressive lunges at the ball forced the Warriors out of the precise and delicate pace. Passes were thrown a foot too far, shots were an inch too far to the left or right. The Warriors didn’t miss by much. But all the Thunder needed to turn a Golden State party into a   war was nudge Curry (26 points on the night) and Klay Thompson (25) to shoot a couple of seconds too soon and from just the wrong angle. The Golden State machine broke down after that. They are the antidote to the effortless brilliance that has been Golden State for nearly these last two seasons. If they are going to win they will win ugly and this is something they are more than fine with. That determination was never more obvious than in the fourth quarter as they fought their way to victory   at one point in the game they had been 14 points down to the Warriors. Durant picked up 26 points, including a crucial jumper with 30 seconds left, and Russell Westbrook scored 24 of his 27 in the second half. “I mean what’s to celebrate?” Durant said of his team’s dour look after what should have been a momentous victory. “We didn’t win the championship. ” He did not smile. Once the Thunder were the Warriors. Once Durant was Curry, a player who played as if he loved every minute he was on the court. Durant wore backpacks to his postgame press conferences and Westbrook had the funny suits. They were everybody’s darlings, the team the world wanted badly to win back. Late on Monday night, long after Curry had dressed and left the arena, Durant lingered in the hall outside the Thunder locker room. He had on ripped jeans and a denim jacket. He didn’t wear a backpack. He didn’t look young and happy. He waited impatiently for Westbrook who was several steps behind and looked less like a fashion icon and more like someone out to walk the dog in an oversized orange sweatshirt. The Thunder have grown up into something far less fun but far more dangerous. They are forgotten and experienced and they know just how to make the Splash Brothers struggle to make everything look easy. Defense wins games. Who knew years ago this would become the mantra of Westbrook and Durant? But if they are to ever win a title together that is the stand they have to take. They never could win everything by being pretty but they might just take it all by playing ugly. The new Thunder will never be as loveable as the boundless Warriors who skip passes through games with a splendid ease that can resemble a   soccer team.  “They didn’t make many mistakes on the defensive end which forced us into bad shots,” Curry said. “Offensively we sucked,” Golden State’s Draymond Green said. This was, of course, but just one game of a long series and the shots Curry took that looked dumb on Monday would have been brilliant had they fallen. He has a way of turning shots that no one should take into works of art. If two of those attempts that clunked of the rim and instead swished through the net we would be talking about another chapter in the   Curry story. But he didn’t make them and with seven turnovers, many on sloppy pass attempts over the Thunder’s formidable front court he fell into the trap set by the new Thunder, the one that will try to grind their way to a championship. In two weeks they have beaten the Spurs and the Warriors three times on their home courts which is as many times as San Antonio and Golden State lost at home all season. After years of despair they have learned to deliver despair to others. Suddenly there is a threat to the Warriors. Few saw the Thunder coming.

What kind of president will Trump be? His erratic transition keeps us guessing
Fresh from his Thanksgiving Florida break, Donald Trump is due to finalise his cabinet in the coming days in an unconventional presidential transition that has kept supporters and critics alike in suspense as to the true nature of his administration. The   has so far adopted a pick’n’mix approach to his appointments, embracing both loyalists and rivals, both career politicians and outsiders with little salient experience. He has similarly been a shape shifter on policy, tempering numerous campaign promises and spitting out random ideas, such as his undiplomatic proposal that Nigel Farage become British ambassador to the US. Observers are asking: will the real Donald Trump please stand up? The one who will be president, that is? “I guess it all depends which President Trump shows up in the oval office,” said Leon Panetta, former defence secretary and head of the CIA. “If it’s the Trump who’s made some irresponsible statements about foreign policy and things we ought to be doing, obviously that would be cause for concern. “If it’s the more responsible President Trump, the guy who gave a pretty good election night speech and had a good meeting with President Obama, if it’s the businessman Trump who’s interested in working with good people and cutting deals and trying to serve the best interests of the county, then it could be a different Trump. I think we’ll get a test of that not only by the tone of the remainder of his appointments but also in how he handles himself once he goes into the oval office. ” Since his stunning election win on 8 November, Trump appears to have relished keeping the pundit class guessing. Each time a pattern appears to be developing in his transition plan, the impulsive   thwarts it with an     manoeuvre or reality   tease. He threw a bone to the Republican party with the appointment of Reince Priebus as chief of staff but simultaneously cheered the   “ ” by naming Steve Bannon of Breitbart News as chief strategist. Yet when white nationalists celebrated at a conference in Washington, even giving Nazi salutes, Trump publicly disavowed them, leading some to accuse him of betrayal. The   gratified hardline conservatives  —   and mortified liberals  —   with a triumvirate of national security appointments: Senator Jeff Sessions as attorney general, retired army general Mike Flynn as national security adviser and Representative Mike Pompeo as CIA director. Sessions has been accused of racist comments  —   he denies any racial prejudice  —   while Flynn tweeted in February: “Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL. ” Asked if Flynn was the right man for the job, Panetta, who knew him at the Defense Intelligence Agency, said: “He could be if he went back to the old Michael Flynn I don’t know if that’s possible. He’s been a little erratic and frankly, in the job of national security adviser, you need somebody who is thoughtful, objective and stable and can allow for different views to be presented to the president. ” But just when it seemed that Trump was rewarding the white men who shouted loudest on his behalf, and deepening the Washington “swamp” that he promised to drain, he switched gear. This week he named Nikki Haley, an Indian American who is governor of South Carolina, as UN ambassador and Betsy DeVos, a billionaire philanthropist, as education secretary. Both women had made clear their antipathy toward him during the Republican primary contest in which they supported other candidates DeVos’s ascent was welcomed by Trump’s old foe Jeb Bush. Haley has little by way of foreign policy experience. Ben Carson, who is African American, is tipped for housing and urban development secretary, even though his expertise lies in brain surgery. This week Trump also held talks with representative Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat who endorsed socialist Senator Bernie Sanders in the primaries, and a sprinkling of multimillionaires. Team or rivals or team of  ? The answer is a bit of both so far. A prime example is the speculation around the plum job of secretary of state, which appears to have come down to a straight fight between one of Trump’s most raucous cheerleaders, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, and one of his most ardent critics,   governor Mitt Romney, who previously branded him a “con man” and “phony” but who Trump reportedly believes “looks the part”. All this fits with Trump’s habit of nurturing internal competition in his organisations as well as his role of the showman, the circus master, forever bending the spotlight in his direction with a surprise meeting here or diverting tweet there. In 1990 he told Playboy magazine: “The show is ‘Trump’. And it is   performances everywhere. ” In this he is the polar opposite of the cool, at times professorial, Barack Obama. Tobe Berkovitz, a political media consultant, told the Hill website: “Trump has again demonstrated that all he has to do is send out a tweet and the media will just go crazy  —   and it’s good for at least two news cycles. [He has] a total understanding of what celebrity is, how do you capitalise on celebrity, how do you profit from celebrity. It’s Celebrity Apprentice except now it’s Celebrity President. ” Two Trumps have been on display to the media this week. In a meeting with broadcasting executives and anchors, he reportedly caused outrage with a series of   rants at “liars!” in their ranks. But then, visiting the office of the New York Times, he struck a magnanimous tone. A coherent ideology was elusive, however, as he backpedalled from several assertions forcefully made during the election campaign. Last month, for example, he told election rival Hillary Clinton: “If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation. ” To the New York Times, he said this week: “I don’t want to hurt the Clintons, I really don’t   …     It’s just not something that I feel very strongly about. ” Does human activity cause climate change? In March, Trump told the Washington Post: “I am not a great believer in   climate change. ” To the New York Times he said: “I think there is some connectivity. Some, something. ” And in a speech in North Dakota in May, he said: “We’re going to cancel the Paris climate agreement. ” To the New York Times he said: “I have an open mind to it. ” Perhaps one of the most telling   came on the issue of torture. In a speech in South Carolina in February, Trump insisted: “Torture works. OK, folks? You know, I have these guys  —  ‘Torture doesn’t work!’  —   believe me, it works. And waterboarding is your minor form . .. we should go much stronger than waterboarding. ” Then he told the New York Times that retired marine general James Mattis, who is under serious consideration for defence secretary, had told him waterboarding is not such a good idea. “I was surprised  —   he said, ‘I’ve never found it to be useful.’ He said, ‘I’ve always found, give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with torture.’ And I was very impressed by that answer. ” To the  ’s defenders, this could be evidence that he is flexible, pragmatic and willing to change his mind. To his detractors, it suggests that he is like a cushion, bearing the impression of the last person he meets. The New York Times columnist Frank Bruni, noting that Trump veered within hours from slamming the the Gray Lady as a “failing” news organisation to lavishing praise on it as a “world jewel” commented: “There was a lesson here about his desire to be approved of and his hunger to be loved. There was another about the shockingly unformed, pliable nature of the clay that is our     . ” That diagnosis makes the cast of characters surrounding him even more important. So far there has been scant consolation for Democrats, although Mattis does have some admirers. Panetta, who was Pentagon chief under Obama, said: “He knows military issues, he’s very thoughtful about how to use the military and I always found him to be a very good adviser. I certainly have no criticism of him as a military leader. ” Trump is managing to strike a delicate balance, believes George Ajjan, a Republican consultant and strategist. “Trump’s appointments thus far indicate that he wants to reward loyalty and stake out ideological ground on a few issues, but also appear as a magnanimous unifier and avoid reinventing the Washington wheel,” he said. “The transition seems well planned and on track, despite the fact that allegations of nepotism and conflicts of interest will hamper him constantly. ” As for those conflicts of interest involving his business, Trump had an answer this week that echoed Richard Nixon: “The law’s totally on my side, the president can’t have a conflict of interest. ” Nixon became the first president to resign while facing impeachment. Trump spent the Thanksgiving holiday at    in Palm Beach, Florida, a luxury estate that was opened in 1927 by one of the richest women in the world, Marjorie Merriweather Post, and donated to the US government in 1973 for use as a winter White House. Trump bought the   property in 1985, opening a private members’ club a portrait of him in a tennis sweater hangs over the bar. The family’s Thanksgiving dinner included stone crabs, oysters, and jumbo shrimp as well as the traditional turkey, stuffing, sweet mashed potatoes and gravy and, for dessert, selections including the tantalising “Three Layer Trump Chocolate Cake”. The businessman could not resist Twitter for an entire day, however, posting: “I am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A. C. Company to stay in the U. S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS   Will know soon!” Carrier, a manufacturing company, announced earlier this year that it would move 2, 000 jobs at two of its Indiana plants to Mexico. After his break he was due to return to Trump Tower in New York to continue the shaping his team, which is still essentially an enigma, his presidency still maddeningly hard to predict. Obama is leading optimists who believe the presidency will cut him down to size but others point to evidence that Trump will always be Trump: at 70, he is a man who is used to getting his way and not likely to change. Speaking at the Montclair film festival, tje TV talkshow host and political satirist Stephen Colbert said: “I’m all for give him a chance but don’t give him an inch. I believe everything he said and I remember everything he said. And it’s horrifying. ” He added: “Everyone tried to stop him and they didn’t. He owes them nothing. He goes on a balcony and he says to the crowd, ‘Shall I do it?’ And they say ‘Yes. It shall be so.’ And the balcony is Twitter  —   that’s the balcony for him  —   and that’s what scares me, is that he owes the checks and balances of Washington nothing because they tried to stop him and they couldn’t. He’s a vindictive person. So it’s all going to be fine. ” • This article was amended on 28 November 2016. An earlier version said James Mattis was under consideration for secretary of state that has been corrected to secretary of defence.

Simple Minds: how we made Don’t You (Forget About Me)
It was the   and we were on the verge of making it big all over the world, having just released Sparkle in the Rain. However, as with many UK bands, the US was proving tough to crack. Then our record company came to us with an idea. The director John Hughes was making a movie called The Breakfast Club, and they thought it would be a great vehicle for their bands. All this sounded great until they said: “And we’ve got a song for you. ” Being chippy Glaswegians, we said: “What? Nah, we write our own songs. ” But Bruce Findlay, our manager, said: “Look, go and see the movie, just so you’re not being rude. ” A cinema in the West End was hired to show us a rough cut, but we couldn’t give a toss about teenage American schoolkids.  But my wife at the time, Chrissie [Hynde] who was older and wiser, kept badgering me. “I like the song,” she said. “What’s the problem?” Finally, the song’s writer, Keith Forsey, phoned me and rather cleverly said: “I’m a huge fan of the band. How about I just spend a couple of days with you? Maybe we’ll do something in the future. ” We clicked right away, though we did spend rather a lot of time in the pub. Eventually, I started to feel sorry for him. “Maybe we should go into a studio for an afternoon,” I said, “and bang out his tune. ” At that stage, the song was just a demo on a battered cassette, with Keith singing over some keyboards. It didn’t sound like something we would do, but in the bonding session with our new best mate we had a go. I added the big “la,    ” ending because I didn’t have any lyrics. I said I’d write some, but Keith said: “Over my dead body. We’re keeping that. ” By the end, we were sneaking off to our rooms to listen to it. The Breakfast Club came out three months later, and Don’t You (Forget About Me) was released as a single. MTV were all over it, and soon it was at No 2 in the US charts. A week later, I was sitting in the south of France when I got a call telling me we had an American No 1. Eight years earlier, in 1977, I’d asked my dad for £100 so we could start the band. He was a brickie’s labourer and just sat there in his vest, like Rab C Nesbitt, thinking we were nuts. “You mean like the Beatles,” he said, “playing in stadiums?” I said: “Probably. ” When we performed Don’t You (Forget About Me) in Philadelphia for Live Aid in 1985, my dad was down the front. It was the first of many stadiums  —   although he never got the £100 back. We started bonding with Keith the minute we found out he’d been the drummer in the krautrock band Amon Düül II. He couldn’t believe we were into German experimental music. He thought it was some obscure thing nobody knew about, so we told him how all our early stuff was based around the same repetitive, metronomic grooves. Then, when we found out he had played all the electronic drums on the records Giorgio Moroder produced for Donna Summer, including I Feel Love, we just adored him. He had so much energy, he was dancing in the studio. We’d just finished Sparkle in the Rain, the biggest, most bombastic album we’d done. So when it came to Don’t You (Forget About Me) I ramped up the intro with these massive power chords. It was almost a caricature  —   I associated powerchords with American AOR. But it worked. We made a video in a manor house, surrounded by a load of stuff from a junk shop, wearing really bad clothes we’d been given. So you’ve got this movie about US   kids, with a song by a band from Glasgow in a manor house in England. It was the thinnest of concepts, but it became huge. At the time, we felt the song didn’t suit us, because we had delusions of being  . When I listen to it now, it’s obviously a brilliant,   pop song. I’m embarrassed we dissed it so much.  • Don’t You (Forget About Me) appears on Simple Minds Acoustic, out now on Caroline International.

Donald Trump to remain executive producer of Celebrity Apprentice
Donald Trump will not give up his role as an executive producer of The Celebrity Apprentice, the reality TV show’s studio said on Thursday, confirming a continuing business entanglement of the   but not its details. Trump’s name will appear in the credits of the show, studio MGM told Variety magazine on Thursday, after the name of show creator Mark Burnett and before that of the program’s new host, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Trump hosted the show for more than a decade before his presidential campaign, during which NBC, the network that airs the show, broke ties with him over his claims that Mexican people are “bringing drugs, and bringing crime, and their rapists”. A spokeswoman for MGM did not immediately reply to questions about the arrangement. The studio did not disclose to Variety any terms of the deal except that it would pay Trump’s fees, and that NBC would not. A spokesman for Trump’s transition team did not reply to a request for clarification. During a string of meetings last month to interview potential cabinet members of the next White House, Trump met with Ari Emanuel, his agent while he was on The Apprentice and the brother of Rahm Emanuel, former White House chief of staff for Barack Obama. Trump gave no details about that meeting, only telling reporters outside a New Jersey golf club that the meeting was “very good. Great guy. Great friend of mine. ” Burnett has denied that he supported Trump’s presidential campaign, and said in October that he and his wife “reject the hatred, division and misogyny that has been a very unfortunate part of his campaign”. The producer also denied that he suppressed leaked unaired footage or audio from Trump’s time on the show. A former contestant, Summer Zervos, is one of several woman who has accused Trump of kissing and groping her. Trump bragged about being able to grab and kiss women without consent in leaked audio from a 2005 appearance on Access Hollywood, near the peak of his fame from The Apprentice. The   has refused to make a clean break from his sprawling and opaque business interests, instead exploring what legal loopholes could allow his daughter and    Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, to play roles of some kind in the government. He reportedly intends to keep a stake in his company, while formally handing control to his two adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr. He has so far declined to fully divest from the holdings, as the Office of Government Ethics has advised, and threatens to test the limits of US law on conflicts of interest. During the presidential election, Trump’s campaign falsely said that handing control to his children would serve as a “blind trust”. Since beginning transition work with the Obama administration, Trump has met with Indian business partners, his Washington hotel has courted diplomats, and his potential interests in Taiwan and Argentina come under scrutiny. Breaking with four decades of political tradition, Trump has also refused to release his tax returns, keeping secret the extent of his wealth or potential conflicts of interest in the US and abroad.

Andy Murray beats Nick Kyrgios to reach quarter-final: Wimbledon 2016 – as it happened
So Murray marches on, winning in under two hours again, clearly determined not to suffer a repeat of his French Open exertions and waste too much energy in the early rounds. He’s into his ninth consecutive Wimbledon   where he’ll face   Tsonga on Wednesday. He beat the Frenchman here in 2010 and 2012 and has won 12 of their 15 meetings. Thanks for reading. That’s all from me today. Bye. Serving for the match, Murray seems to lose concentration, knocking a forehand too long for  . Yet he wins the next two points for a   lead before crunching a contemptuous forehand away to earn two match points. He only needs one. An ace out wide finishes the job. Ruthless. Third set: Murray       Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Serving to stay in the match, Kyrgios is down   after Murray speeds on to a drop shot and dabs a backhand down the line. Kyrgios makes it   then aces for   but the game goes to deuce when he yawns a backhand into the net. Soon Murray has a match point as Kyrgios overcooks a backhand down the line. Kyrgios denies him by   but Murray earns a second match point with an outrageous forehand pass from right to left. Yet he’s forced to wait again after netting a forehand and Kyrgios holds. Murray will have to serve it out. You never know. Third set: Murray*       Kyrgios (*denotes server): A Murray backhand flicks off the top of the net and flies straight at Kyrgios, who is only able to react by blocking a volley short. Murray flicks a forehand beyond him for   aces for   and holds to love when Kyrgios nets a forehand. The difference today, beyond ability, has been mentality. Kyrgios’s response to losing the first set will only provide his many critics with more ammunition. He’s such a talent but it will lead nowhere if he isn’t willing to put the effort in. Third set: Murray       Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios holds to 15. Belatedly, some resistance. He doesn’t have much but he does have hope. Third set: Murray*       Kyrgios (*denotes server): John McEnroe is panning Nick Kyrgios on the BBC, criticising him for a “mentally lazy” performance. Murray holds to love. Roger Federer hasn’t dropped a set yet and Murray looks like maintaining his immaculate record as well. “You’d think Kyrgios might have an easier time of it if he weren’t wearing what looks like a week’s worth of shirts at once,” says George Chapman. “Looks very uncomfortable indeed. ” Third set: Murray       Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios holds to 30, Murray steering a backhand wide after reaching a drop shot. He’ll be feeling a bit better after that but, well, y’know. Third set: Murray       Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios didn’t bother sitting down during the changeover. He just walked round the net and milled around the baseline. He’s . .. well, he’s a character. If it’s a tactic   and I suspect it isn’t   it’s not going to work. Murray is torturing him. He skips into a   lead, his forehand and backhand clicking beautifully. This is just so good from the world No2 and he holds to love, consolidating the break. This might not be the classic we were hoping for but at least we can bask in a Murray masterclass. Third set: Murray       Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Murray is desperate to get this done in three sets. He charges into a   lead and he’s beginning to chip away at the Kyrgios serve. Kyrgios then flays a forehand wide to give up three break points. Murray can’t take the first, so he takes the third, attacking a second serve before skelping a forehand away. “Come on!” he cries. He’s inserted himself inside his mate’s head and Kyrgios is really feeling it now. Third set: Murray*       Kyrgios (*denotes server): At   Murray looks like he’s reacted to a huge forehand down the line from Kyrgios with a defensive backhand slice. Instead it turns out it’s a drop shot winner. That’s absurd. You know, there are people who say Murray’s miserable and dull. I say that they’re miserable and dull. He makes it   with a forehand lob and holds with a drop shot. Third set: Murray       Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios holds to 15. Sorry. I was having Wifi problems. Serving for the first set, Murray drops the first point, crashing a forehand too long. Yet Murray wins the next point before two consecutive aces earns him a   lead. He’s a set away from reaching another Wimbledon  . That set lasted 26 minutes. Second set: Murray     Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Whoever wins this match will play   Tsonga in the last eight. The 12th seed led by a break in the first set against his fellow Frenchman, Richard Gasquet, who’s been forced to retire after pulling a back muscle. That’s rotten luck for a player who’s been in fine form this year. As for who’ll face Tsonga, it’s looking like Murray at the moment. Kyrgios is falling apart. He’s rushing everything now, disintegrating, playing three awful points to hand Murray three break points. He saves two of them. He splutters a forehand wide to gift Murray the third, though, and this set is surely done. Kyrgios gestures to his box but there’s only one person deserving of blame here.  Second set: Murray*     Kyrgios (*denotes server): Kyrgios rouses himself with a searing backhand down the line for   but it’s   after he knocks another one wide. Murray then makes it   with an ace out wide. He holds to 15. Kyrgios looks like he’s checked out mentally at the moment.  Second set: Murray     Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios is in trouble after pulling a careless backhand wide for  . Then Murray comes up with a strong backhand return and Kyrgios nets a backhand to give up two break points. He’s flirting with disaster and though he saves the first break point, he drops his serve when he nets another volley off a firm Murray backhand. Second set: Murray*     Kyrgios (*denotes server): Kyrgios shows some excellent anticipation at the net, dealing with a series of attempted passes from Murray, eventually making it   with a well judged volley. Soon he has a   lead, Murray netting a forehand. The Scot’s annoyed with himself and he needs to be careful, with Kyrgios clearly trying to raise his level. Kyrgios lets him off the hook a little, however, doing nothing with a second serve return, allowing Murray to make it   with a forehand. Murray makes it   with a flat forehand that allows him to win the point with a volley but the game goes to deuce after a loose forehand from Murray. This isn’t a straightforward game for Murray but he earns a game point with a stunning drop shot, allowing him to knock a backhand down the line. He holds when Kyrgios, seemingly losing interest for a second or two, needlessly slices a forehand into the net. Odd. Second set: Murray     Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios rattles into a   lead, drop shotting, then serving big. Soon it’s   as Murray hoicks another backhand lob wide. He’s missed two of those today. Kyrgios then tries a   tweener. It goes long  ’s lucky he did it at   because there’s enough time for him to batter an ace away to hold. Second set: Murray*     Kyrgios (*denotes server): Murray wins the first point, then wallops a glorious forehand pass down the line. Kyrgios slips heavily but he’s soon back to his feet. He can’t do anything about a wide ace from Murray for  . Murray holds to love. Kyrgios needs to switch on, forget about the volley that gave up the first set. Serving to stay in the first set, Kyrgios nets a backhand for   before Murray cracks a backhand pass beyond him for a   lead. Suddenly he’s two points from the first set. Make that one set. He spots Kyrgios coming forward and befuddles him with a teasing backhand slice. Kyrgios can only stumble and volley wide for  . Three set points, then. But Kyrgios saves the first with a 129mph ace, then the second with a 136mph serve that Murray blocks wide. Yet Murray gets the third one back and now Kyrgios is vulnerable. Murray is forced wide  —   but he whips a forehand from right to left and Kyrgios, perhaps not expecting it to come back, clips a forehand volley into the net! Oof. That was a very good first set and it’s gone to the favourite. This is how it went in last year’s US Open. First set: Murray*   Kyrgios (*denotes server): The first two points are shared, Kyrgios making it   with a sweet touch at the net. He’s so talented, blessed with skill that can’t be taught. Murray’s a classy operator as well, though, and he holds to 15, Lendling Kyrgios on the final point. Kyrgios will have to hold to force a  . First set: Murray   Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios shakes his head and smiles as a roar of support for Murray from the crowd delays his first serve for a moment or two. It doesn’t seem to put him off on the first point but he does lose concentration on the second, thrashing a gimme of a volley miles past the baseline, almost into the Royal Box. He shakes it out of his system, though, serving confidently and moving into a   lead. He holds to 15. He’s shown composure in every difficult moment. This is very tight. This set could go either way. First set: Murray*   Kyrgios (*denotes server): Sensing that this could be his chance after that hold, Kyrgios gives a Murray second serve the treatment and shows some good hands at the net with a volley for  . “No!” he cries, however, after netting a backhand down the line for  . Murray was off balance and out of position. Reprieved, Murray makes it   with a trademark drop shot but he’s under pressure after an errant forehand makes it  . Once again, he’s not getting that first serve in. But he makes it   after Kyrgios nets a forehand at the end of a lengthy rally. “Swing! Swing! Swing!” Kyrgios shouts. Murray holds with a precise forehand and Kyrgios will have to hold to prolong the first set. First set: Murray   Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Murray plays the first point carefully, waiting, waiting, waiting, patient, patient, patient, then landing the first strike with a pinpoint forehand for  . He’s beginning to work Kyrgios over and he’s pumping his fist when he dominates and whips a forehand from left to right for a   lead. Yet Kyrgios punches pack, serving well for   then making it   with a clean forehand winner. A huge ace down the middle makes it  . Brilliant. Murray challenges in vain. Another ace is a fine way to hold from   down. First set: Murray*   Kyrgios (*denotes server): Kyrgios can only block long off two Murray serves on the first two points. He’s annoyed with himself. Murray then wallops a smash away to make it   before sealing the first hold to love by winning a game of cat and mouse at the net. First set: Murray   Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios is being positive enough to move in off his serve. Though it can be a risky tactic against Murray. At   Murray scoops a forehand over the stranded Kyrgios, who then pulls a forehand wide to make it  . A clever ace out wide from Kyrgios makes it   though, Murray failing to read it and he holds with a crunching forehand down the line. He’s passed that test. First set: Murray*   Kyrgios (*denotes server): Murray loses the first point, dragging a forehand into the net to make it  . It’s all very interesting. Then Murray appears to snooze a forehand long. Or has he? He challenges and Hawkeye, trusty Hawkeye, shows that it caught the line. Kyrgios is undeterred. He unwinds on the next point, a forehand missile softening Murray up before he feathers a drop shot over the net. Murray can only dab wide and it’s  . Yet here’s a sign of the Kyrgios inconsistency, a wasteful drop shot into the net making it  . He had Murray on the run there. Soon it’s     and Murray holds when a Kyrgios forehand down the line drops just wide. First set: Murray   Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Murray has never lost to an Australian but if anyone’s going to put an end to a run that stretches back to 2006, it’s surely Nick Kyrgios. Could it be today? It’s definitely not out of the question. The first two points in this game are shared before Kyrgios moves into a   lead with a delicate drop shot. Then he   for a   lead. He polishes it off with more strong serving, barrelling forward to punch a forehand away. They’ve both started well. First set: Murray*   Kyrgios (*denotes server): A first serve from Murray kisses the line and befuddles Kyrgios, who mistakenly challenges. That’s  . Murray holds to 15, Kyrgios smacking a forehand long on the final point.  First set: Murray   Kyrgios* (*denotes server): The first game of many out of the way, time to change ends, with Murray in front of the Royal Box now. He gets a look at a second serve on the first point and wins it, hitting his forehand powerfully. He should win the next one too, pulling Kyrgios forward with a drop shot but hooking a backhand lob wide. By his standards, that’s a poor miss and a costly one, too, because it gives Kyrgios a platform to race into a   lead thanks to two rasping serves. The game goes to   but Kyrgios holds with another excellent ace. First set: Murray*   Kyrgios (*denotes server): Here we go. Nick Krygios, headband on (on his head, I hasten to add you never know) springs up from his chair first and he’s soon followed by Andy Murray, who’s greeted by a huge cheer from the crowd. It’s Murray to serve first and he loses the first rally, slicing into the net for  . He responds by swinging an ace down the middle. At   they trade in a series of low backhand slices, the cause of much hilarity in the crowd. This is what passes for comedy. Murray eventually nets a backhand and the umpire asks the crowd to keep their “enthusiasm” to themselves until the point’s done. After all, this is a tense start, with Murray not making too many first serves. In the end, though, he holds to 30 with his second ace down the middle. The players are out. They’re knocking up. Tok! Tok! Tokity tok. John McEnroe is tipping a victory for Murray. But then he was wearing a snapback with a suit earlier. The roof has come off Centre Court for this one and the atmosphere’s building. This should be the best match of the tournament so far and it might   assuming he wins   be Murray’s toughest before the final. These two are the best of mates off court as well. “It was love at first sight,” Kyrgios says. Nick Kyrgios on Nick Kyrgios: “I’m obviously relaxed, I’m nervous as well. ” He’s not a straightforward guy. Hello. When it’s put to Andy Murray that all that’s left to do is collect the trophy on Sunday now that Novak Djokovic is out, it’s understandable that he pays little attention. There’s plenty of hard work left for the world No2, even though he’s looked imperious so far. Today Murray puts his bromance with Nick Kyrgios to one side and he’ll know that the Australian youngster is a huge threat to his ambitions of winning Wimbledon for the second time. Though Murray is yet to lose to Kyrgios, knocking him out of three of the four grand slam events last year, there’s a first time for everything. This one’s likely to be eventful.  Play begins: soon.

Rough trade: the global economy needs a jumpstart to benefit all
The global economy has expanded greatly since the early 1980s, thanks to technology breakthroughs, the opening of markets and trade being more accessible. Today, trade generates $15tn annually. Nearly $5tn in goods and services flows in and out of the US alone each year. This development has affected people across socioeconomic classes. Former US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson noted in a recent column that the average household income in America is about $10, 000 more than it would have been without this trade progress. And the number of people living in extreme poverty dropped drastically from 1981 to 2010, according to the World Bank. “Trade, with support from aid, has been responsible in the past few decades for the greatest reduction in poverty that society has ever witnessed, by driving economic growth across the globe,” says Peter Harris, Europe region director of sustainability at UPS. “It is therefore essential that we find ways to continue to trade ever more effectively. ” Due in great measure to the Great Recession and moderate economic recovery, the rate of global trade growth has slowed this decade. The World Trade Organization (WTO) forecasts that in 2016, it will be less than 3% for the fifth straight year. Factors like climate change, booming populations and cybersecurity concerns have left the future uncertain. Meanwhile, some critics believe that trade agreements such as the proposed   Partnership (TPP) are not fair for everyone. Officials and academics are seeking solutions not only to help businesses, but also for people across the globe. Pros and cons of TPP, Much of the recent conversation about global trade has surrounded the TPP, which is currently awaiting ratification. The TPP covers 12 countries, including the US  —   and with them, approximately 800 million people and 40% of the global economy. Its provisions could bring down existing tax barriers to help increase agriculture, manufacturing and services exports among trading partners. Customs agencies in the TPP countries are also working to improve electronic processing of data and advanced screening of packages. This would help reduce time, cost and complexity in trade. Still, the TPP has become highly politicized. Critics say it goes against the interests of US workers who could potentially lose jobs to companies overseas. Proponents counter that the TPP could help trading partners among member nations to develop global supply chains in which their products are designed, sourced and assembled in many different countries  —   spreading wealth and making global trade more balanced. “The notion that one nation’s success at exporting is another’s failure is no longer true,” says Leslie Griffin, senior vice president of international public policy at UPS. “The   Partnership will create new opportunities for many players and give a needed boost to global trade. ” Bringing nations together, Caroline Freund, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute, and other academics suggest a way that governments can soothe those who say they’ve been left behind by globalization: provide aid to workers who lose their jobs because of   reasons. Those workers have legitimate concerns and needs. Still, experts like Freund maintain that trade’s benefits are too important to roll back. “There’s always been this misconception out there that trade is a   game, and it’s not,” she says, “As we trade, the pie just gets bigger. Trade makes everyone better off. So, it’s great  —   but it’s not great for everybody all the time. ” Freund notes another major benefit: a balanced global trade ecosystem fosters peace. “Countries that trade a lot tend not to go to war [against each other],” she says. “It’s much easier to get countries to oblige on noneconomic issues when you already have this kind of business community that’s very intertwined. ” For proof, see the relationships between the US and many European nations over the past 70 years. “It’s not hard to argue that in Europe but also in the US, the   War II era has brought peace, wealth and stability,” says Marietje Schaake, a member of the European Parliament from the Netherlands who’s also a commissioner with the Global Commission on Internet Governance. “We shouldn’t dismiss what we have built together. ” Level the playing field in the digital age, One major argument is that global trade agreements focus only on helping big businesses. That could change as   continues to evolve, creating an environment in which   and   companies can go global immediately  —   and thus compete    with major corporations.  “This is enabling the ‘entrepreneurial economy’ where large businesses face new competition and where small businesses see huge opportunities,” Griffin says. For the first time in any trade agreement, the TPP includes language focused on helping small and   businesses. It addresses trade barriers that disproportionately challenge small businesses, including opaque customs regulations, complex trade paperwork and slow delivery of small courier shipments. Making trade work for the environment, As the quantity of goods shipped worldwide increases, there’s an urgency to make trade more environmentally friendly. “Trade is essential for global social and economic sustainability, but making these compatible with environmental sustainability is arguably the hardest challenge of all,” says Harris. “We will need dramatic improvements in technology to contain emissions as trade  —   and therefore goods movement  —   expands. ” Take the shift to “slow steaming” of ocean cargo, whereby ships deliberately go slower than their top speeds. This has had “a very significant reduction on carbon emissions,” according to Sean Doherty, head of international trade and investment at the World Economic Forum. Trade agreements and technology will continue to evolve, and there will be even greater attention on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the manufacture and delivery of goods worldwide. Governments and businesses alike will have to ensure these processes are effective as policies and protocols change in the years ahead. “The key responsibility for lawmakers like myself is to look at how we can frame global trade in a   system to ensure standards safeguarding the environment,” Schaake says. “That workers and peoples’ fundamental human rights are strengthened by agreements that provide a frame or embedding for global trade. ” To read more about these issues and see some of the solutions that have emerged, see the 2015 UPS corporate sustainability report.

Jamie Shupe becomes first legally non-binary person in the US
When an Oregon judge declared Jamie Shupe could legally shed the designation of male or female, Shupe felt free. “I have my life back,” Shupe said. “I’m not a male. I’m not a female. ”  Shupe appears to be the first person in the United States who has successfully petitioned for a   gender classification, according to Hayley Gorenberg, deputy legal director for Lambda Legal, a New   gay rights organization. “Classic gender markers don’t fit everybody,” Gorenberg said, calling the petition significant for helping people “exist without labels that don’t accurately describe them”. At a recent support group meeting in Portland, where Shupe lives, a young woman tearfully thanked Shupe for broadening the conversation about gender classifications. Shupe, a former army sergeant assigned male at birth and listed as female in discharge papers, told the woman, “I didn’t do this just for myself. ”  Shupe, who prefers the pronoun “they” grew up in southern Maryland, in a family with eight children. Shupe recalls feeling like an outcast, being admonished for acting like a “sissy” and without any role models, struggling to articulate feelings of a gender mismatch. At age 49, retired from the military, married to a woman and raising a daughter, Shupe began to unravel.  “I felt like I was at a breaking point,” Shupe said, “like I was trapped. ”  With a supportive spouse, Shupe moved to a secluded cabin in the woods and began taking hormones.  “I figured I was a transgender woman. My thinking was, well, I’m not a male,” Shupe said. Sandy Shupe said the transition was difficult at times.  “This is the person I’ve spent most of my adult life with,” she said. “We have a child together. I have always said, old age and rocking chairs. That’s still my thought, old age and rocking chairs. When you love someone, you want them to be at peace with themselves. ” Later, Shupe realized the female designation also didn’t feel right.  “No amount of hormones is going to make me look like a female,” Shupe said, taking off a headscarf to reveal a bald head. Shupe doesn’t have plans or the desire to undergo surgery.  “Now, I’m suddenly telling my spouse I’m the same thing she is? It didn’t make sense to me. I didn’t have the intricate knowledge like I do now that I could be other things. ”  Shupe wanted another option, a third classification, and found an ally in Portland lawyer Lake Perriguey.  “I knew the law well enough to know there is no exclusion, it’s not a complicated statute,” Perriguey said. “It’s two lines. People change their names, the process to change your sex identity is the same as changing your name. ”  Perriguey said initially he didn’t realize the historic significance of the case.  “Not being a person of transgender experience, I didn’t realize how confining the legal limit on your gender identity could be,” he said.  Shupe understood there are others with similar struggles and felt compelled to take the case to court, steeling for a    fight.  Instead, the petition was granted swiftly.  Multnomah County circuit court judge Amy Holmes Hehn granted the petition last week, writing: “The sex of Jamie Shupe is hereby changed from female to  . Notice of this legal change shall be posted in a public place in Multnomah County as required by law. ” Shupe’s legal tab was $1, 056.  Now, at 52 years old, Shupe said, the petition “gives me a place to exist”.

Mel and Sue leaving Bake Off: how social media reacted
First came the revelation that the Great British Bake Off was leaving the BBC for Channel 4.  However, the news that presenters Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc will not be going with it has been particularly hard to swallow for diehard fans  —   if the anguish vented on social media is anything to go by. There was also dismay from former contestants and celebrities. Among them was Richard Burr, who took part in the 2014 series.  Another 2014 contestant, Martha Collison, described the duo as “irreplaceable”. Jo Wheatley, the Bake Off champion in 2011, said she was “really hoping this isn’t true” and that “Mel and Sue are as big a part of GBBO as Mary [Berry] and Paul [Hollywood]”. John Whaite, the winner of the show in 2012, was initially eager to dampen down the gloom. But news of the departure of Giedroyc and Perkins caused a change in his mood. “Mel and Sue jump ship. Very sad news,” he tweeted. “They’re wonderful girls who made the show what it is. Now, I’m not feeling so hopeful . .. ” Perkins and Giedroyc confirmed they would not be fronting Bake Off when it moves to Channel 4 next year, saying in a statement they were “not going with the dough”. They have presented the popular show since 2010 and said they were “shocked and saddened” to learn of the Bake Off’s forthcoming move from the BBC. Amid the inevitable speculation over who will be the new hosts, the   favourite to front the new series is Jo Brand  —   presenter of   show An Extra Slice. The bookmaker William Hill was offering odds of  . Other popular names in the mix include the actor Jennifer Saunders with   odds, the comedian Sarah Millican at   and the comic Ed Byrne at  .

Trump’s meeting with congressional Republicans inspires divided response
Republican opponents of Donald Trump in Congress described meetings with the presumptive GOP nominee as awkward on Thursday and sparred with him, while Trump’s supporters raved about his visit to Capitol Hill. Trump held separate meetings with both the House and Senate caucuses on a sweltering summer day as he tried to continue to unify the GOP behind him. The Republican nominee, accompanied by his daughter Ivanka,    Jared Kushner and chief strategist Paul Manafort, started the day by meeting with House Republicans at the Capitol Hill Club. Cable news pundit Larry Kudlow introduced Trump, who also joked and exchanged hugs with Paul Ryan, although the speaker has long been unenthusiastic about the real estate developer’s candidacy. Some House members left the private meetings giving a highly positive account of Trump’s comments. Ralph Abraham of Louisiana said his party’s nominee talked about “growth, security and prosperity, all the good things” while fellow Louisiana congressman and Senate candidate John Fleming said there was “a lot of positive energy” and “the entire conference was uniting behind Donald Trump”. In his remarks, Trump reportedly addressed a number of policy issues while also harping on what he felt was unfair media criticism over his praise for Saddam Hussein killing terrorists in recent days. His grievances were shared by many in the room. Trent Franks of Arizona, a   “former critic” of Trump, complained to reporters afterwards: “You missed all the ugly things he said about Saddam Hussein but if he says he [Saddam] kills terrorists he’s in love with Saddam Hussein. Of all the stupidity and misappropriation of the truth. ”  Although Trump received multiple standing ovations, he may not have been the most popular member of his family in the room. When Peter King of New York said members had their choice who to take a picture with, they flocked towards Trump’s daughter, Ivanka. “She’s the star,” King said. But there were also critics in the room. Mark Sanford of South Carolina mocked Trump afterward for referencing article XII of the US constitution in response to a question about article I, which delineates Congress’s powers. There are only seven articles in the constitution. Other longtime Trump detractors were left unimpressed, too. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, an Iraq war veteran, grimaced at Trump’s unprompted mention of the Saddam controversy. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania rolled his eyes in describing Trump to reporters. “He complained about the media, shocking,” said Dent. Dent also noted that Trump proclaimed: “Hispanics love him. ” Dent noted that this statement was not borne out in any polls. In a meeting afterwards with senators only a few blocks away, things got more heated. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who has pointedly refused to endorse Trump, reportedly confronted the Republican nominee. Flake noted that he was the Arizona senator who wasn’t captured, a reference to Trump’s disparaging remarks last year about John McCain, and Trump responded by predicting Flake would fail to win  . Mark Kirk of Illinois, who has withdrawn his endorsement of the nominee, later told reporters: “I think Trump will get a vote like Alan Keyes got in Illinois, around 28%,” a reference to the sacrificial lamb candidate who ran for the Senate against Barack Obama in 2004. Other Republicans tried to play down the exchanges between Flake and Trump. John Thune of South Dakota told reporters that they were simply the kind of “frank exchange you have inside the family” while Thom Tillis of North Carolina insisted that this was “a perfectly appropriate discussion” that only made up a few minutes of a longer meeting. Yet despite those conflicts, many senators enthused about the meeting. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a longtime supporter of Trump, said “there were a massive number of converts” after the meeting. After the gathering, Trump held a    meeting with primary rival Ted Cruz and asked the Texas senator to speak at the convention. Cruz, who has yet to endorse him, agreed.  Others attending praised Trump’s policy chops. Tim Scott of South Carolina thought the discussion was “meaty” and there was “a lot of policy” while senator Bob Corker of Tennessee noted that Trump showed “there’s a lot more nuance to his positions than people realized”. However, there was a tendency for the presumptive nominee to ramble, as Sen Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma noted: “You’ve watched him he talked about every issue. ” Yet all that policy detail still didn’t woo the most diehard   member of the Senate. Ben Sasse has long been vocal about his opposition to Trump and in a statement, a spokesman for the Nebraska senator said: “Senator Sasse went to today’s meeting ready to listen. Senator Sasse introduced himself to Mr Trump and the two had a gracious exchange. Mr Sasse continues to believe that our country is in a bad place and, with these two candidates, this election remains a dumpster fire. Nothing has changed. ”

Careless whisker: Universal to release album for cats
They are a particularly tough audience  —   picky, moody, often impossible to please  —   but cats represent an untapped music market, according to one of the world’s biggest record labels. Universal Music has announced it will be the first major label to release an album that is not for human consumption  —   although, until cats get bank accounts, humans will have to pay for it. David Teie, an American cellist and music researcher based at the University of Maryland, has created Music for Cats, saying it is an “absolutely serious” undertaking . He said: “It is the biggest challenge with this, people think it is silly. But I think it is the way the brain works . If I look at a door and say that’s a fish, you are going to say that’s a door . Everybody knows what music is  —   and animals are not included. If you really look into it, what’s silly is the idea that only one species could have music available for it. ” The music features purring and suckling noises, as well as Teie on his cello accompanied by players from the US National Symphony Orchestra. It is aimed at calming and bringing pleasure to cats, rather than getting them excited. Teie produced the album after first studying whether music could be created for   tamarin monkeys. Those experiments were so successful that he decided to widen them. “There are not very many   tamarin owners out there so we decided if we were to go out and spread the word, spread the music, we should go with a species we hang around with a lot,” he said, Dogs were ruled out because there are so many variations in the breeds. “I was worried about having to write terrier music and labrador music and so on  —   it would have slowed things up,” Teie said. So cats were chosen and it has proved successful, with studies showing the recordings are most effective for cats who can be neurotic or nervous or may have been abused in the past. Wary cat owners who couldn’t recall their pet ever enjoying or reacting to music should be aware they were playing them the wrong melodies, said Teie. “There have been many studies done and they basically all came up dry because animals don’t give two hoots about our music and they really shouldn’t,” he said. The original music for cats was   after a whirlwind Kickstarter campaign quickly attracted pledges of nearly $250, 000. That caught the eye of Universal, which promptly signed Teie up. Teie admitted he had gone through emotions familiar to many musicians ploughing an independent furrow. “I was very excited about it at first, then not excited about it . .. was I signing my life away to somebody else? Now that it is all done I’m very excited again,” he said. The album will be released in all territories on 28 October, and given that there are 9. 2 million cats in the UK alone, Universal believes there is an enormous untapped market. A spokesperson said the label was “thrilled to be part of this   project” and predicted “Music For” albums could follow for dogs and horses. Teie said he hoped that the more animal music became available, the more it would be accepted. “I am hoping that in a hundred years from now people will have to be taught that music was once only for humans,” he said. If that happens then people may remember Teie as the true pioneer. But his research has not always been easy. “As a matter of fact I’m allergic to cats,” he said. “I’ve grown from being an admirer to a genuine cat lover now, but I’m still allergic. ”

The grey parrot and the race against Africa’s wildlife extinction
Perry, a    African grey parrot, is for sale on a   pet trade website for £750. She looks in good condition with her large black bill, red tail and white mask and her owner says she can whistle the tune of Flower of Scotland, does a passable imitation of R2D2 and is “very clever and funny”. What Perry’s Scottish owner does not tell prospective buyers is that the African grey is close to extinction in the wild largely because of the international pet trade. Although there have been restrictions on the export of these small and intelligent birds since 2009, dealers pay a pittance for tens of thousands of them to be trapped every year in the rainforests of west and central Africa and smuggled out. It’s easy to catch them, say researchers from Birdlife, a global grouping of conservation groups. A team of hunters will use decoys or go to the birds’ water and mineral licks in the forests where flocks gather. They then throw nets over them and take dozens at a time. Once caught they will be smuggled over borders, stuffed in tiny cages and flown illegally to Europe, South Africa, the Middle East and China, where they may fetch up to £1, 000 each. All this makes the African grey probably the most highly traded bird in the world, causing their numbers to plummet from Nigeria to Cameroon, and from Ivory Coast to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Some conservationists estimate only 1% of their historical numbers remain. This week moves are afoot that could give hope to the African grey’s future. Nine African states, the European Union and others will ask world governments and EU at the triennial meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites) in Johannesburg to give the highest international protection to the bird. But it is far from the only species whose future hangs in the balance and whose fate could be determined at this year’s meeting. The Cites convention, signed by more than 180 countries and the EU, is the best hope the world has of stemming the growth in the £150bn a year wildlife trade and of reversing catastrophic animal and plant losses. Against the backdrop of a surge in African elephant and rhino poaching, and continuing deforestation and habitat losses, governments will come under intense pressure in Johannesburg to increase protection for many hundreds of endangered species. Ministers will hear from scientists, technical experts and conservationists that the fate of wildlife is at a crossroads, with populations crashing and a   extinction taking place. The precipitous decline of the African grey echoes what is happening to hundreds of other plant and animal species, including the African elephant, the tiger, rosewood trees, pagolins, banggai cardinal fish and many others, say conservationists. Last month the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) revised its animal danger lists.   species are said to have become extinct in the wild 5, 107 are critically endangered 7, 600 are endangered and 16, 000 are “vulnerable” or “threatened”. Within a human generation, the meeting will hear, species such as the African elephant, tiger, gorilla and lion could be on the verge of extinction in the wild as a result of illegal hunting, habitat loss and the pet trade. The trade in illegal ivory has more than doubled since 2007. “Africa’s overall elephant population has seen the worst declines in 25 years, mainly due to poaching over the past 10 years,” the IUCN’s   Inger Andersen, will say. “Their plight is truly alarming. Poaching has been the main driver of the decline, while habitat loss poses an increasingly serious,   threat to the species. ” Cites protects about 5, 000 animal and 30, 000 plant species, and ministers will be asked to change the protection status of more than 500. Some, like the lion, African elephant and pangolin, are high profile, but many reptiles, coral and fish, such as the banggai cardinal fish, are barely known. Nearly all the 62 proposals put forward by governments will be to increase protection. But a few species, like the panda and peregrine falcon, are no longer considered to be in danger and could have their protection reduced. Many countries will be admonished for allowing the illegal trade in animal parts and plant species to flourish. Laos has pledged to phase out its controversial tiger farms, which supply neighbouring China with bones and other parts for traditional medicine. But international animal trade inspectors will report in Johannesburg that rhinoceros horn, elephant ivory and many other wildlife specimens are being regularly smuggled through the country both to China and other   Asian countries. “Laos is being targeted by organised crime groups as a transit point,” says wildlife trade monitoring network Traffic. “No arrests or prosecutions related to illegal trade in rhino horn, elephant ivory and other wildlife specimens have occurred in the country since 2012. Significant loopholes still exist in national legislation. ” South Africa, the host country, is certain to be embarrassed, having lost nearly 6, 000 rhinos to poachers since 2007, including more than 700 this year. Vietnam will be told to crack down on its rampant illegal rhino horn trade or face sanctions, and China will be identified as the world’s primary destination for precious woods. “Vietnam’s poor law enforcement record speaks for itself ending the illegal rhino horn trade and helping to save Africa’s rhinos is clearly not a priority for the government,” said Ginette Hemley, WWF’s head of delegation to Cites. “With around three rhinos being poached each day, there is no time to lose. Cites must take a tough line with Vietnam: swiftly implement critical measures to tackle the illegal rhino horn trade or be banned from legally trading many wildlife products,” she said. Chinese consumption will be blamed for the plight of the tiger but also for the loss of west African forests. Soaring demand for expensive classical furniture made of rosewood is driving deforestation. “Most Chinese imports of rosewood have come from   Asia, but in recent years traders are turning to west Africa to help satisfy booming consumer demand. From 2010 to 2014, China’s rosewood imports from Africa jumped 700% and in the first half of 2016 alone nearly $216m worth of west African rosewood was imported into China,” international forest group Forest Trends will report. But whereas pressure for increased wildlife protection has, in the past, come from scientists and campaigners, the drive for better protection now comes from celebrities, business groups, royalty and governments with agendas of their own. Prince William has made wildlife a personal cause and, working with elephant conservation group Tusk, has lobbied President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping to take action to stop the trade in ivory. In November he will go to Vietnam for a conference on the illegal wildlife trade. “When I was born, there were one million elephants roaming Africa,” said the prince last week. “By the time my daughter Charlotte was born last year, the numbers of savannah elephants had crashed to just 350, 000. And at the current pace of illegal poaching, when Charlotte turns 25 the African elephant will be gone from the wild,” he added. “This crisis is not just about animals  —   this crisis is about people. It is some of the world’s poorest peoples who will suffer when their natural resources are stripped from them illegally and brutally,” he said. Last week Joanna Lumley weighed in to voice dismay at a proposal at Cites to allow the trade of horns from rhinos that have died from natural causes, or recovered poached horns. “This iconic species should not be reduced to a commodity that can be plundered for human indulgence,” said the actress. Since the last meeting, in 2013, governments, too, have found a new reason to crack down on wildlife crime. According to the London international affairs thinktank Chatham House, wildlife crime can lead to international terrorism, and the destabilisation of vulnerable democracies. The Somali militant Islamist group   is said to generate its funding from illegal ivory sales. But everyone knows that the international trade restrictions which Cites can impose on countries are limited and nowhere near enough to stop the £150bn a year trade. The measures, say conservationists, are complicated, difficult to enforce, do not take the place of national laws, and are implemented in different ways by different countries. Moreover, court fines are nowhere near enough to deter poaching or smuggling. The street value of ivory is now more than £1, 500 a kilogram in Beijing, and rhino horn can sell for £50, 000 per kilo  —   far more than the price of gold or platinum  —   on the Chinese black market. Meanwhile rosewood can sell for many thousands of pounds a cubic metre. The UN environment programme says that 88 countries must strengthen their laws if they are to implement Cites decisions and combat illegal trade in wildlife. Many, including Bolivia,   Kazakhstan, Kenya, Liberia, Mauritania and Mozambique must to do it urgently, says the UN body. Animal welfare groups say that Cites pays no attention to the treatment of animals. “Every year it rubberstamps the trade in thousands of live animals from Africa, but corruption and a complete disregard for the wellbeing of these animals means that most will suffer mistreatment, and many will experience unimaginable cruelty during their capture and transport,” said David Barritt, Network for Animals’ chief campaigner. “International trade bans are critical to saving wildlife, but without rigorous efforts to prevent poaching and trafficking they are never enough on their own. Organised criminal networks will continue to target threatened species, as we have seen with rhinos, elephants and tigers,” said the WWF. The Johannesburg meeting will be the largest ever, with more at stake than ever before, said John Scanlon, Cites  . “Cites is critical to fight the illegal trade in wildlife. Thousands of species are internationally traded and used by people in their daily lives for food, housing, healthcare,   cosmetics or fashion. ” If countries agree to protect the grey parrot, either by consensus or by a   majority, an outright ban will be placed within 90 days on its international trade. It would also mean that all owners in Britain and elsewhere will have to register their birds. The exotic pet trade, which has powerful political support in many tropical countries, will lobby, but with backing for a total trade ban also likely from Washington and Brussels the parrot is almost certain to join 1, 000 other species, such as tigers, rhinos and gorillas, on what is known as Cites Appendix I, the list of most endangered species. If it stays on Appendix II, which includes sharks, polar bears and lions, some limited trade will continue to be allowed. “Cites has remarkable power. It is a pragmatic and honest convention. Discussions can be robust and intense. If there is no consensus on a request, it goes to a vote. The stage is set for a remarkable two weeks,” said Scanlon. But whether Cites really saves the African grey parrott, the pagolin and the rosewood tree from vanishing is far from certain. Many west African countries are seeking a total ban on the commercial trading of lions. Numbers have declined by about 60% in the last 20 years in some countries as a result of habitat loss and the spread of human settlement, but lion populations have increased in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe thanks to good wildlife management. Countries that promote trophy hunting will object to an upgrading of lions’ protection. The probably outcome is that western and central African lions will be placed on Cites’ Appendix I, while other populations remain on Appendix II. South Africa, whose waters are home to a quarter of the world’s   shark species, has proposed with other countries that protection of many more species of shark be strengthened. The silky shark, three species of thresher shark and nine species of mobula ray could all be put on Appendix II for the first time because all are said to have seen declines of more than 70%. Countries will consider several proposals to clamp down on the ivory trade, destroy stockpiles, close legal domestic ivory markets, restrict live animal exports and create a mechanism for a future ivory trade. Currently, all African elephants are included in Appendix I, except for those in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, which are in Appendix II. One contentious proposal from Namibia and Zimbabwe seeks to move the populations of all four countries to the most stringent Appendix I level. Along with South Africa, they also propose to adopt a mechanism to permit commercial exports of ivory from lesser protected Appendix II range states. Conservation groups were encouraged this month when the IUCN World Conservation Congress voted by a 90% majority to pass a resolution urging countries to close their domestic markets for commercial trade in raw or worked elephant ivory. Last week Britain pledged to ban all domestic trade in ivory that could not be at least 70 years old. Swaziland has submitted a highly controversial   proposal to be allowed to sell its stockpile of around 330kg of valuable southern white rhino horn and some 20kg annually from animals that died naturally. The proceeds from a   sale to traditional Chinese medicine hospitals would, it says, raise nearly $10m which, placed in an investment fund, could earn enough to pay for conservation and cover the $2m annual costs of running the country’s three national parks. It argues that the    worldwide ban on the sale of horn has clearly not worked, with more than 1, 200 rhino killed a year in Africa, and that there is little likelihood of demand in China reducing. Far better, it says, to strictly control poaching and to trade judiciously with selected partners. The proposal has dismayed conservationists, who say that the animals are critically endangered and that any legal trade would provide cover for poaching and undermine existing international and domestic bans. These burrowing,   anteaters with sticky tongues are critically endangered and ranked as the world’s most hunted mammals, with possibly a million illegally poached in the past 10 years for their meat, plus their scales and skins, which have become luxury fashion materials. They are already partially protected but some species can still be traded with permits. Countries will consider several proposals to have all international trade in nine African and Asian species totally banned. Rosewood is one of the world’s most precious timbers, highly sought after in China and   Asia for luxury furniture. But as trees are logged out in Asia, criminal gangs are targeting forests in west Africa and Latin America to meet unprecedented demand. Five proposals at Cites seek to tighten export and import controls, but success depends on whether China adopts stronger national laws and resists the illegal trade.

Florida man shot dead after asking if bulletproof vest ’still worked’
Police said a Florida man who asked if a bulletproof vest “still worked” was fatally shot by his cousin. A Tampa police report said    Joaquin Mendez put on the vest late on Saturday and “wondered aloud whether it still worked”. The report said Mendez’s cousin,    Alexandro Garibaldi, pulled out a gun and responded: “Let’s see. ” Officers found Mendez outside the house with a gunshot wound in his chest. He died at a hospital. According to the police report, Garibaldi initially told officers he found his wounded cousin after hearing a gunshot. However, police said a witness described Garibaldi shooting Mendez. Police said the vest was found inside the house, having sustained a gunshot. Garibaldi was held on Sunday without bond on a manslaughter charge. Hillsborough County jail records did not show whether he had an attorney.

‘None of the old rules apply’: Dave Eggers travels through post-election America
The word surreal is overused and often wrongly used, but in the case of the Washington Post Election Night Live party, the word was apt. First of all, it was a disco. There was a DJ playing a frenetic mix of contemporary Top 40 and pointedly apropos songs such as Pat Benatar’s “Hit Me With Your Best Shot” (“You’re a real tough cookie with a long history   …     ” ). Behind the DJ there were dozens of screens showing various television networks’ coverage of the election. The screens were so bright and so huge, and the colours so primary and vivid, that the experience was like being trapped inside an enormous jar of jelly beans. Women dressed like Vegas showgirls made their way through the crowd with towering tiered hats adorned with chocolates from one of the evening’s sponsors. The chocolates, round and the size of strawberries, were offered in pairs, enclosed in loose plastic sacks  —   a bizarre but perhaps intentionally lewd optic? The bartenders were setting out Campari Americanos by the dozens. The food was by chefs José Andrés and the brothers Voltaggio. The Washington Post has a right to celebrate  —   the paper is thriving and its political coverage extraordinary  —   but this felt like Rome before the fall. At some point early on, the music was turned down for 20 minutes so Karen Attiah of the Post could moderate a live conversation between the current German ambassador, Peter Wittig, and former Mexican ambassador Arturo Sarukhan. The talk was serious and enlightening, but the ambassadors seemed baffled by the nightclub atmosphere, and besides, few people were listening. The party was about the party. And everyone expected Hillary Clinton to win. The attendees were largely Washington insiders  —   lobbyists, staffers, legislative aides, pundits and producers. Most were liberal and most were confident. The night’s only potential for suspense centred around whether or not Clinton would take some of the   states, like Florida and North Carolina. When she was declared the winner  —   which was expected before the party’s scheduled   of 10 o’clock  —   there would be talk of who would be appointed what, with a   portion of the partygoers in line for positions in the new administration. Thus the mood was ebullient at seven o’clock, when the event started, and was electric by eight. Kentucky and Indiana were announced for Donald Trump and that news was met with a shrug. More scantily clad women walked through the rooms serving hors d’oeuvres, and soon there were at least three showgirls wearing hats of towering  . Young Washingtonians swayed to the music. Drinks were set under chairs and spilled. A young girl in a beautiful party dress walked through the drunken partygoers looking for her parents. Then nine o’clock came around and the party began to turn. Most of the states thus far had gone for Trump. None of these victories was unexpected, but the reddening of the national map was disheartening, and the margins in those states were often greater than expected. He took Texas, North Dakota, Kansas, Mississippi. Not a problem for the crowd, but by 9. 30, people were panicking. Trump was leading in Florida and North Carolina. Nate Silver, the statistics shaman who had been roundly criticised for overestimating Trump’s chances, now posted that a Trump victory was likely. Ohio was in the bag, Pennsylvania was trending toward him, and it looked like he could win Wisconsin and Michigan. A hundred guests turned their attention from the big screens to their little screens. They paced and made calls. The party emptied and we all spilled into the streets. Beyond the Washington Post building and beyond DC, the country had been swamped by a white tsunami few saw coming. For a few hours, the city had the feeling of a disaster movie. People scurried this way and that. Some wandered around dazed. Following the returns, we travelled from restaurant to bar to home, and the Somali and Ethiopian cabbies were stunned, worried less about Trump than about the prospect of Rudy Giuliani serving in the cabinet in any capacity. We all talked about where we will move: Belize New Zealand Canada. We no longer knew our own country. In Columbia Heights, when the election was settled, a young woman biking up the hill stopped, threw her bike into the middle of the road, sat on a kerb and began weeping. “No no no no,” she wailed. The omens were there if you looked. A month before the election, I’d driven from Pittsburgh to the Philadelphia suburbs and saw nothing but   signs. In three days I covered about 1, 200 miles of back roads and highway  —   some of the prettiest country you can find on this continent  —   and saw not one sign, large or small, in support of Clinton. The only time any mention of her was made at all was on an enormous billboard bearing her face with a Pinocchio nose. I did see Confederate flags. James Carville, the political strategist, recently quipped that Pennsylvania is Pittsburgh and Philadelphia with Alabama in between, and there is some truth to that. There are a lot of men in camouflage jackets. There are a lot of men out of work. When you stop at gas stations, the magazine sections are overwhelmed by periodicals devoted to guns, hunting and survival. Then there are the tidy farms and rolling hills, the equestrian centres with their white fences, the wide swaths of Amish and Mennonites and Quakers. I was in rural Pennsylvania to see the United 93 National Memorial in Shanksville  —   a monument to the 40 passengers and crew who died in a windswept field on  . The day I visited was bright and clear. The surrounding country was alive with autumn colours and, far on distant ridgelines, white windmills turned slowly. Just off the parking lot, a park ranger in forest green was standing before a diverse group of middle school students, admonishing them. “Boys and girls. Boys and girls,” he said. “You’re standing here where people died. There are still human remains here. You’re goofing around and laughing, and I shouldn’t have to tell you to be respectful. They deserve that. ” They quieted for a moment before one of the boys nudged another, and the giggling began again. The memorial is beautifully constructed and devastating in its emotional punch. Visitors can walk the flightpath of the plane, a gently sloping route down to the crash site, which is separated from the footpath by a low wall. “It’s a grave,” another ranger explained. “So we don’t walk there. ” Higher on the hill, there is an indoor visitor centre that recreates every moment of the day in excruciating detail. There are video loops of the Twin Towers being destroyed, fragments of the plane, pictures and bios of every passenger, details about the calls they made from the plane once they knew they would die. It is shattering. Leaving the museum, a man in front of me, young and built like a weightlifter, couldn’t push the door open. I reached over him to help and he turned to thank me. His face was soaked with tears. I got into my car, shaken but heartened by the courage of the 40 humans who had realised what was happening  —   that they were passengers on a missile headed for the White House or Capitol building  —   and had sacrificed their lives to save untold numbers in Washington DC. The American passengers of United 93 were from 35 different cities in 11 different states, but they died together to save the capital from incalculable loss of lives and what might have been a crippling blow to the nation’s psyche. I left the memorial and turned on to a   road, part of the Lincoln Highway that runs through the state  —  part of the first    highway in the United States. Just beyond a sign advertising   sweetcorn, there was a residential home, the first house anyone might encounter when leaving the United Memorial, and on this home, there is a vast Confederate flag draped over the front porch. It’s important to note that this was the Lincoln Highway. And that the civil war ended 160 years ago. And that Pennsylvania was not a state in the Confederacy. So to see this, an enormous Confederate flag in a Union state, a mile from a symbol of national tragedy and shared sacrifice, was an indicator that there was something very unusual in the mood of the country. Ancient hatreds had resurfaced. Strange alliances had been formed. None of the old rules applied. Steven McManus has come out of the closet twice. First as a gay man, then as a Trump supporter. We were sitting at a coffee shop in Detroit’s Eastern Market neighbourhood, and McManus was almost vibrating. This was two days after Trump’s election, and McManus was elated  —   about the victory, yes, but more personally, about the fact that after Trump’s election, he’d had the courage to post a message on social media declaring his support of the  . “I lived a lot of my life as a closeted guy,” McManus said, “and the liberation I felt as a man coming out was similar to how I felt coming out for Trump. You really truly think you’re the only one who has these feelings. It’s liberating. I felt it was time to come out again. ” McManus is a thin man in his late 30s, bald and bespectacled, with a   beard. He grew up in the part of the Detroit suburbs known as Downriver. Many of the area’s residents had come from the American south in the 1940s to work in the auto factories, and the area still retains a southern feel. His father was a salesman who brokered space on trucking lines. Looking back on it now, McManus appreciated the fact that his parents could raise five children on one salesman’s salary. But then came the Nafta, and the gutting of much of the Detroit auto manufacturing base. McManus watched as Detroit and Flint hollowed out and caved in. “Trump was the only candidate talking about the trade imbalance,” McManus said. “Being a businessman, a successful businessman, he understood why business   at the highest levels of their companies, move their production overseas. ” McManus was angry when auto companies, after receiving bailouts from the US government in 2009, continued to move production to Mexico. “In Detroit, we gave America the middle class. But this is now a false economy. The housing market is decimated, and the middle class is shrinking. I want someone to shake it up. Let’s move the whole country forward. ” McManus is not blind to the rareness of an openly gay man supporting Trump. “But I don’t have to vote a certain way based on my sexuality. In my mind we’ve moved beyond having to vote Democrat just because you’re gay. ” And he’s not worried about a reversal of the   right to marriage gays just achieved. “We’ve got our rights now,” he said. “It’s settled. ” McManus and his husband got married three years ago in New York, before the supreme court decision legalised gay marriage nationwide, and it was in his new place of domestic tranquillity that McManus watched the Republican national convention. Two moments affected him profoundly. First was the appearance of Peter Thiel, the former CEO of PayPal, who was given a prime speaker’s spot and said from the stage, “Every American has a unique identity. I am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican. But most of all, I am proud to be an American. ” McManus was moved then, but he was even more affected by an unscripted part of Trump’s speech. “It was shortly after the Orlando massacre, and for the first time in my life, a Republican candidate for president said things like, ‘  wonderful Americans’ or ‘beautiful Americans’ or whatever he said, ‘were savagely murdered’. And he said, ‘I will protect gay and lesbian individuals.’ Some people at the convention cheered and some people didn’t cheer. And then Trump said, off the cuff and off the teleprompter, he said, ‘For those of you who cheered, I thank you.’ And I cried. I cried. ” McManus’s husband works for the army, as an IT specialist, and they both became bothered by Clinton’s email setup. “If my husband had done the same thing, he’d be fired. And it’s pretty hard to get fired from a government job. ” McManus began to follow Trump more closely, and found that he was agreeing with most of his positions on trade, immigration and national security. “I began to realise that I’m more conservative than I thought. ” But he couldn’t reveal this. He lives in Detroit, a liberal city, and works in the restaurant industry in town, where   politics dominate. But after coming out as a Trump supporter, he is finding himself emboldened. The day after the election, McManus saw his doctor, who is Muslim, and he mentioned that he’d voted for Trump. “I just wanted to get it off my chest. I was feeling a little   …     ” McManus sits up in his chair, to indicate the new confidence he felt that day. “I told him, I came out as a Trump supporter today. And he went off for 15 minutes  —   to the point where I almost walked out. He was impassioned about how he felt that Trump was disenfranchising  . But our present state of terrorism does have a religious undertone to it. Finally I managed to get something off my chest. I can’t remember who said this to me, either my husband or my ex, but I said to my doctor, ‘You know, it wasn’t a group of Catholic nuns that flew planes into the World Trade Center. ’” Later that night in Detroit, I ran into Rob Mickey, a professor of political science. He grew up in Texas, but has spent about 10 years teaching at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. We were at a party benefiting an educational nonprofit. Doing something concrete and positive felt good, and being around kids felt good, but everyone was exhausted  —   no one had slept since the election  —   and 30 seconds into every conversation it turned to Trump, Clinton, what had gone wrong and what would happen next. One of the event’s attendees had been living in a central American cloud forest for years, and there was much talk about following her down there. I told Mickey about McManus, and to him, the story of the gay Trump supporter was both surprising and unsurprising. Everything about 2016 was upside down. Parts of Michigan who had voted twice for Obama had turned to Trump. Rob and his wife Jenny had gone canvassing for Clinton on the Sunday before the election, and the reception they received was not warm. “I would say it was hostile,” he said. They had gone to Milan, Michigan, an overwhelmingly white town 50 miles southwest of Detroit. “It’s spelled like the Italian town, but pronounced ” Rob pointed out. The Clinton campaign had given Rob and Jenny a list of names and addresses of white   residents who had registered as Democrats but were labelled sporadic voters. Milan had voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012, and winning towns such as Milan was key to delivering a Clinton victory in Michigan. The homes they visited were   with “No Soliciting” placards on every door. They saw no Clinton signs on anyone’s lawn. There were Trump signs scattered around town, but most of the residents they met were disgusted by the entire election. “One woman said, ‘I don’t want to have nothing to do with that,’” Mickey recalled. “Another said, ‘I hate them both, including that guy of yours.’ When I pointed out that our candidate was a woman, she said, ‘Whatever’ and slammed the door. ” One house with a Bernie Sanders sign on the lawn looked promising. Mickey knocked on the door. A white man with a US ARMY shirt answered. He was missing an arm. Mickey introduced himself as a Clinton canvasser, and told the man he had supported Sanders, too, during the primary. “That’s great,” the man said, and closed the door. “The people we met that day were straight out of central casting, if you were making a movie about the disaffected white working class,” Mickey said. “Between 55 and 65, without college degrees. You could see that Lena Dunham and Katy Perry were not going to do anything to form a bridge to these people. If I hadn’t read any polls, and I was basing it just on the people I met, I would have thought, boy, Clinton’s going to get wiped out. ” It was different in 2008. Knowing that Michigan was securely in Obama’s column and Ohio was on the bubble, Rob and Jenny went to Toledo to knock on doors in trailer parks and housing projects. Foreclosure signs were common. When they introduced themselves as canvassers for Obama, the residents, all of them white, were welcoming and chatty. “The interactions were long,” Mickey said. “The people were worried and they wanted to talk. ” Ohio’s 18 electoral votes went to Obama in 2008 and 2012. “This campaign wore a lot of people down,” Mickey said. “The state was bombarded by   ads, but she failed to offer any sustained and coherent economic message. She said, ‘I’m not crazy’ and ‘I’m not a sexist racist pig’ but for working class whites that’s not enough. I would say that of the people who slammed their doors on me, most of them didn’t vote for either candidate. ” In fact, an unprecedented number of Michigan voters cast ballots without choosing either Clinton or Trump. This kind of voting happens every election  —   where voters make their preferences known   but don’t mark anyone for president  —   but never in such numbers. In 2012, there were 50, 000 Michigan voters who declined to choose any presidential candidate. In 2016, there were 110, 000. Clinton lost Michigan by 10, 704 votes. The week after the election, the business of the United States went on. Schools and banks were open. The stock market plummeted and rose to a new high. Commuters commuted, and I was headed from Detroit to Kentucky. All of this was travel planned months before, and none of it had anything to do with the election, but it felt like I was making my way, intentionally, into the heart of Trump country. At Detroit airport it was impossible not to feel the tragedy of Tuesday as having realigned our relationships with each other. Because the voting had split so dramatically along racial lines, how could an   or Latino pass a white person on the street, or at baggage claim, and not wonder, “Which side are you on?” The emergence of safety pins to symbolise support for Clinton (and equality and inclusion) was inevitable  —   it fulfilled a need, particularly on the part of white Americans, to signal where they stand. Otherwise all iconography is subject to misinterpretation. At the airport, I found an older white man staring at me. His eyes narrowed to slits. I was baffled until I realised he was looking at my baseball hat, which bore the logo and name of a Costa Rican beer called Imperial. Was this man a Clinton supporter who suspected me of being a white nationalist? Was the word Imperial sending a Ku Klux   Reich signal to him? Anyway, I was in the wrong terminal. I was in danger of missing a flight to Louisville, so I left and poked my head into a Hertz bus and asked the driver if he would be stopping near Delta anytime soon. He paused for a moment. “Yeah, I’ll take you,” he said. His name was Carl. He was a lanky   man in his 60s, and we rode alone, just me and him in this enormous bus, for a time. He asked how I was doing. I told him I was terrible. I was feeling terrible, but I also wanted him to know which side I was on. He laughed. “Yeah, I was surprised on Tuesday, too,” he said. “But I almost feel sorry for Trump. I don’t think he thought he’d actually win. You see him sitting next to Obama at the Oval Office? He looked like a child. ” In Louisville, three days after the election, I sat with 32 students at Fern Creek high school. This was supposed to be a regular classroom visit by someone passing through, but the atmosphere was different now. The students at Fern Creek are from 28 countries. They speak 41 languages. There are refugees from Syria, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. We sat in an oval and ate samosas. Nepalese samosas, I was told. Three of the students in the class were from Nepal, and had a particular recipe. The food was extraordinary. I told these students, three girls still learning English, that I’d always wanted to go to Nepal, and asked them to write down some places they’d recommend. They wrote “Jhapa, Damak (Refugee camp). ” They were from Bhutan and had grown up in a UNHCR camp in eastern Nepal. A young man to my left had come from Iraq two years earlier. Their teachers, Joseph Franzen and Brent Peters, guided the conversation through topics of creativity, social justice and empathy. The students were without exception thoughtful, attentive and respectful of each other’s opinions. Every time a student finished a statement, the rest of the class snapped,   in appreciation. We didn’t talk politics. For the time being, the students had had enough of politics. The day after the election, they’d had a charged discussion about the results, and, still feeling raw, they had written about the discussion the next day. “The thing I didn’t say yesterday was that Muslims scare me. The thing with Isis is out of control and I don’t trust them at all and I don’t get why Mexicans can’t take the test to become legal? Are they lazy?” “The election didn’t really bother me even with the outcome, I didn’t support Trump. The main reason I cared about Clinton winning was ’cause I didn’t want my family to be affected. My mom is gay and married to a woman. ” “As a Muslim female in high school it’s hard to deal with this and let it sink in. But I know Trump doesn’t have full power of his actions. So I feel like even if he’s president, everything will be the same. ” “I was downright disappointed in the country. Because Trump won, racism, sexism, misogyny and xenophobia won. It goes to show what our country values now. Either this is what we value, or this is what the majority is OK with. ” “I feel like everything said yesterday doesn’t even matter anymore. We as American citizens can’t change what’s been decided. Not everybody gets what they want. That’s what life is. Trump will be our new president and we can’t change that. WE need to make America great again, NOT Trump. That’s our job as people. ” “I think Trump and Hillary are both crazy and I’m kind of eager to see how trump runs this    . ” And so we see how differently we express ourselves on paper. The students, sitting in their oval with the smell of Nepalese samosas filling the room, were unfailingly kind to each other. But on paper, other selves were unleashed. Despite the many international students, the school’s population is mostly   48% white and 38% black, and it was easy to see how Trump could bring dormant grievances to the fore, could give licence to reactionary theories and kneejerk assumptions. The students had witnessed eight years of exquisite presidential   and dignity, and now there would be a    man in the White House whose feelings were easily hurt, who called people names, and who tweeted his complaints at all hours, with rampant misspellings and exclamation marks. Our only hope will be that the 100 million or so young people in American schools behave better than the president. A president who has not read a book since he was last required to. Think of it. After the class, a tall   student named Devin approached me. He’d introduced himself before the class, and had asked some very sophisticated questions about using imagery to convey meaning in his poetry. He was a wide receiver on the school’s football team, he said, but he was also a writer. He handed me a   piece of paper, and on it was a   he wanted me to look at. We sat on top of my house, laying back, looking at the stars, the stars shining, waving back at us. They told us hello. Time froze. I turned my head to look at you. Still fixated on the stars, you paid me no mind. I studied you. This was the true face of beauty. Your royal blue eyes, the brown polka dots on your face. Your smile making the moon envious because it could not compare in light. I reached out to grab your hand. You turned your eyes to look at me. Our hands intersected and we both smiled. I told you you were were beautiful. Below the piece, Devin wrote, in red ink, “Do I have something here? Should I continue?” That night in Louisville there was another benefit event, this one for an organisation called Teach Kentucky, which recruits   college graduates to come to the state to teach in the public schools. Joe Franzen and Brent Peters are among Teach Kentucky’s recruits, and if they are any indication of the quality of humans the organisation is attracting, the programme is a runaway success. At the event, Franzen and Peters spoke about their craft, and about making sure their students felt they had a place at the table. There was much talk about their classrooms as families, of meals shared by all, of mutual respect. It was very calm and heartening, but there was also a moment where the audience was encouraged to let out a primal scream (my idea, I admit it) and 200 people did that, screamed, exorcising our   demons. Later on, Jim James  —   Louisville resident and leader of the rock band My Morning Jacket  —   performed a medley of songs, from Leonard Cohen to “All You Need Is Love” and “Blowin in the Wind”. And then everyone got drunk. There was good bourbon. It was called brown water by the locals, and after stomachs were full, we all vacillated between despair and measured hope. But the questions loomed over the night like the shadow of a Nazi zeppelin. Would he really try to build a wall? Would he really try to exclude all Muslims? Would he actually appoint a white nationalist as his chief of staff? And did 42% of American women really vote for a man who threatened to overturn Roe v Wade and who bragged about grabbing them by the pussy? Did the white working class really elect a man whose most famous catchphrase was “You’re fired”? Like a teenager with poor   the American people had chosen the flashy and abusive boyfriend over the steady, boring one. We’ve had enough decency for one decade, the electorate decided. Give us chaos. It is not easy to get a ticket to Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. This is the newest museum on the National Mall in Washington, DC, and its design, by the   architect David Adjaye, is so successful, at once immediately iconic and bold but also somehow blending into the   surrounding architecture, that it has become the most   building in the United States. Admission is free, but there is a   wait for passes, and the passes are timed. If you get a pass, you must enter at the assigned hour or wait another six months. I had gotten such a timed pass, and it so happened that the pass was for the day after the election. That morning, I had the choice between staying in bed, forgoing my one chance at seeing the building in 2016, or rising on three hours’ sleep and keeping the appointment. Like millions of others, I did not want the day to begin. If I woke up, I would check the news, and if I checked the news, there would be confirmation of what I had remembered foggily from the night before  —   that the people of America had elected a reality television host as their president. I closed my eyes, wanting sleep. Then I remembered the Gazans. Back in April, I had been in the Gaza Strip and had met a married couple, Mahmoud and Miriam, journalists and activists who badly wanted to leave Gaza. I had   them to an asylum lawyer in San Francisco, but from 7, 000 miles away, she couldn’t do much to help. The impossible thing was that they actually had a visa. A real visa issued by the American state department. All they had to do was get out of Gaza. But permissions were needed from the Israelis or Egyptians, and they were having no luck with either. Finally, one day in October, an email arrived. Mahmoud and Miriam were in Brooklyn. They’d bribed an Egyptian guard at the Rafah gate and had made their way on a 14‑hour journey through Sinai. So on a lark I told them to meet me in DC. Frederick Douglass had said, after all, that every American should visit the nation’s capital at least once. And given they would soon be Americans, wouldn’t it be good to do that duty right away, and do it the day after the first woman had been elected president? (We had made the plans a week before.) So they had planned to meet me at this museum celebrating   history in the shadow of the obelisk dedicated to George Washington, great man and also slaveowner. The morning was clear and cool. A small line had formed outside the museum before the doors were to open. I looked around, and didn’t see them. Then I did. They were aglow. They’d spent their lives in an   prison of 141 square miles, and now they were here. They could move about freely, could decide one day to go to the capital of the United States and be there a few hours later. No checkpoints, no bribes, no Hamas secret police. I’d seen Miriam suffer in Gaza because she refused to wear the hijab and favoured western clothes. In Gaza City, she was yelled at, cursed. “I hope your parents are proud!” people yelled to her. Now she was herself, uncovered, dressing as she chose. Her smile was incandescent. “I’m so sorry,” I said. I was apologising for what we’d done the day before. Electing the man who wanted to ban all Muslims from entering the country. The man who might bring Giuliani into a seat of unspeakable power. This could mean terrible things for Palestinians. There was already talk of the end of the   solution. Netanyahu, it was assumed, had danced all night. “It’s OK,” they said. They handed me a gift. It was a piece of the Gaza City airport. The airport had been destroyed by Israel in 2002. The piece they’d brought me was tiled it looked like part of the airport bathroom. I thanked them, put the chunk of concrete in my bag, and we wondered aloud whether the security check at the museum would object to the entry of a shard of Gazan airport. We passed through the doors, and I was allowed to keep my bag with me, so we three, and part of the Gaza City airport, made our way through the museum’s halls. It was glorious of course, and altogether too much to take in in one day. We ate in the basement cafeteria, and talked about what was next. They would need an asylum lawyer, and fast. Ninety days, and then anything could happen. “Don’t worry,” Mahmoud said. The Gazan asylum seekers were telling me not to worry. But I was worried. Worried enough to change their names in this piece. They aren’t Mahmoud and Miriam. We are entering an era where uniquely vindictive men will have uniquely awesome power. Dark forces have already been unleashed and terrible plans are being made. On 3 December, the Ku Klux Klan are holding their largest public rally in years, to celebrate Trump’s victory, which they claim as their own. I also changed Steven McManus’s name. I worried for him, as well. You should be worried, too. George W Bush, a man of comparative calm and measured intellect, started two foreign wars and cratered the world economy. Trump is far more reckless. We are speeding toward a dark corridor, my friends. Keep your eyes open, your hearts stout and be ready for the fight.

Why is it so hard to make a sobriety test for marijuana?
On 8 November, voters in California, Maine, Massachusetts and Nevada approved ballot measures to legalize recreational cannabis. It is now legal in a total of eight states. This creates potential problems for road safety. How do we determine who’s impaired and who’s not? The effects of alcohol vary based on a person’s size and weight, metabolic rate, related food intake and the type and amount of beverage consumed. Even so, alcohol consumption produces fairly straightforward results: the more you drink, the worse you drive. Factors like body size and drinking experience can shift the correlation slightly, but the relationship is still pretty linear, enough to be able to confidently develop a blood alcohol content scale for legally determining drunk driving. Not so with marijuana. We have a reliable and    test to measure blood alcohol concentration. But right now we don’t have a fast, reliable test to gauge whether someone is too doped up to drive. The need is urgent. The 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported that 10 million Americans said they had driven while under the influence of illicit drugs during the previous year. Second to alcohol, marijuana is the drug most frequently found in drivers involved in crashes. But how do you know when you’re too stoned to drive? How can police tell? My colleagues and I at the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research at UC San Diego have received a $1. 8m grant from the state of California to gather data about dosages, time and what it takes to impair driving ability  —   and then create a viable roadside sobriety test for cannabis. Alcohol and marijuana both affect mental function, which means they can both impair driving ability. Some elements of cannabis use are similar. Potency of strain affects potency of effect. Marijuana and its active ingredient  —   THC  —   alter brain function, affecting processes like attention, perception and coordination, which are necessary for a complex behavior like driving a car. Regular users tend to become accustomed to the drug, particularly in terms of cognitive disruption or   skills. Because they are accustomed to the drug’s effects, this means they may function better relative to naive users. Smoked marijuana produces a rapid spike in THC concentrations in the blood, followed by a decline as the drug redistributes to tissues, including the brain. The psychological impact depends upon a host of variables. Let’s say, for example, a person smokes a joint and gets into his car. THC levels in his blood are likely to be quite high, but his cognitive functions and driving skills may not yet be impaired because the drug hasn’t yet significantly impacted the brain. But another driver might use cannabis but wait a few hours before getting behind the wheel. Her THC blood levels are now quite low, but she’s impaired because drug concentrations remain high in her brain. Six states have set limits for THC in drivers’ blood, and nine other states have   laws, making the presence of THC in the driver’s blood illegal. But unlike alcohol, evidence of cannabis use can linger long after its effects have worn off, particularly if people are regular users or consume a lot in a single episode. Among chronic users, it may not clear out of their systems for weeks. Therefore, unlike blood alcohol concentration, the presence and amount of different cannabis compounds in the blood or urine do not necessarily tell you whether the driver is impaired due to marijuana. This is why a quick and simple assessment of whether someone is driving while under the influence is difficult. And that is a necessity for any type of effective roadside sobriety test. To create a fast and    test, there are a few questions about marijuana that our team at UC San Diego has to answer. Current blood, breath, saliva and urine tests have been challenged as unreliable in court, though they are used to prove that someone has ingested marijuana. In California and elsewhere, the primary assessment of impairment is the law enforcement officer’s field sobriety test. One specific challenge is determining the relationship of dose or potency, and time since consumption, to impairment. While there has been some research in this area, the studies have not comprehensively examined the issues of dose and time course of impairment. The lack of data is one of the big reasons for our work now. Later this year, we will begin controlled experiments in which participants will smoke varying amounts of cannabis in varying strengths and then operate a driving simulator. We’ll look for impairment effects in the immediate period after exposure and over subsequent hours. We’ll also investigate the relationship between THC and other cannabinoid levels in blood to different measures, such as saliva or exhaled breath. Roadside blood sampling is impractical, but perhaps there is an easier, reliable indicator of marijuana exposure. Finally, there is the goal of finding the best way to assess impairment. A driver suspected of being high might be asked to follow with his finger a square moving around on a device’s screen, a test of critical tracking. Or she might perform tablet tests that more validly simulate the demands of driving. The idea is to determine whether and how these measures  —   drug intake, biomarkers, objective cognitive performance and driving ability  —   correlate to produce an   broadly applicable assessment standard and tool.

Fallen Muslim American soldier’s father scolds Trump: ’have you even read the constitution?’
The father of an American Muslim killed in the US military in Iraq stunned the Democratic convention on Thursday night with a powerful challenge to Donald Trump, who he said had “sacrificed nothing and no one”. Appearing on stage in Philadelphia alongside his wife, Ghazala, Khizr Khan paid tribute to his late son, Cpt Humayun Khan, describing his family as “patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country”. Of his son, killed in 2004 by a car bomb after protecting his soldiers by ordering them to drop to the ground while he took 10 steps forward, Khan said: “If it was up to Donald Trump, he never would have been in America. “Donald Trump consistently smears the character of Muslims. He disrespects other minorities, women, judges, even his own party leadership. He vows to build walls and ban us from this country. ” The Republican candidate has repeatedly suggested a temporary ban on Muslims entering the US as a way to combat the threat of Islamist terrorism.  In his party convention speech in Cleveland last week, this policy appeared to have been altered to cover “any nation that has been compromised by terrorism” something Trump subsequently described to NBC as an expansion.  “People were so upset when I used the word Muslim,” said Trump. “Oh, you can’t use the word Muslim. Remember this. And I’m OK with that, because I’m talking territory instead of Muslim. ” Addressing Trump directly, Khan told him: “Donald Trump, you are asking Americans to trust you with our future. Let me ask you: Have you even read the United States constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy. ” Producing a pocket edition of the US constitution to huge cheers from the crowd, he added: “In this document, look for the words ‘liberty’ and ‘equal protection of law’. ” He went on: “Have you ever been to Arlington cemetery? Go look at the graves of the brave patriots who died defending America  —   you will see all faiths, genders and ethnicities. You have sacrificed nothing and no one. ” Departing from his text, Khan concluded: “I ask every patriot American, all Muslim immigrants, and all immigrants, do not take this election lightly. This is a historic election. And I request to honor the sacrifice of my son. And on election day, vote for the leader, Hillary Clinton, not the divider. ” In her speech to the convention accepting her party’s nomination, Hillary Clinton paid tribute to Khan’s son, saying: “A president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country  —   including Captain Khan, and the sons of Tim Kaine and Mike Pence, both marines. ”

More than 1,200 new planets discovered through Nasa’s Kepler space telescope
Nasa added more than 1, 200 new planets to the known galaxy on Tuesday, more than doubling the number of confirmed planets orbiting alien stars. Revealing data from the Kepler space telescope, the astronomers said that the discovery is a step toward finding   planets. “This gives us hope that somewhere out there, around a star much like ours, we can eventually discover another Earth,” said Ellen Stofan, Nasa’s chief scientist. Analysis on data from Kepler found that 1, 284 candidates have a 99% chance of being a planet, of 4, 302 potential planets detected by the telescope. Kepler searches in particular for planets in the “habitable zone”  —   close enough to a star for water to pool on the surface of a planet. Not so close that the star scorches water out of existence, as on Mercury, and not so far that water only persists as ice, as on Pluto. “Kepler has detected about three dozen planets or planet candidates in the Goldilocks zone,” mission scientist Natalie Batalha told reporters. She said that almost 550 of the newly confirmed planets could be rocky planets like Earth, according to their size. The new research has added “nine more planets to this exoplanet hall of fame,” she said, using the term for planets that orbit stars outside the solar system. The findings make 21 total exoplanets known to be about the same size and orbit as the Earth to the sun. “When you look up in the sky you’re not just going to see pinpoints of lights and see them as stars,” Batalha said, “you’re going to see pinpoints of light as planetary systems. ” Kepler detects planets by noticing the tiny dimming of light when a planet passes in front of its star, as the sun did on Monday when Mercury made its rare transit across its face. But these signals could also be caused by any manner of objects moving through space, creating false positives and a great deal of caution among scientists.  Batalha said that researchers found many “an astrophysical impostor” but that the data from Kepler, combined with new statistical technique published in the Astrophysical Journal on Tuesday, had vastly increased astronomers’ ability to confirm planets. Kepler requires three transits to confirm a detection, said Tim Morton, an associate research scholar at Princeton University and a   of the new paper.  “It’s taken about 15 years of hard work for astronomers to find and confirm about 2, 000 transient planets that’ve been found from the ground,” Morton said. His contribution to the discovery was a means of assigning each planet candidate a probability for its “planethood” and he compared the problem to cleaning up crumbs spilt all over the floor. “If you spill a whole bucketful of small crumbs, you’re going to need a broom to pick it up. ” The new planets were found in only a small patch of the night sky, between the constellations of Lyra and Cygnus. Nasa’s astrophysics director Paul Hertz linked Kepler’s mission to one of the space agency’s greatest objectives: the search for life beyond Earth. “One of the great questions of all time is whether we are alone in the universe. We live in a time when humanity can answer this question scientifically,” he said. Hertz said that the findings show there could be more planets than stars, and Batalha said her “back of the envelope calculation” suggests “tens of billions of potentially habitable” worlds. She admitted that scientists still only have a small sample size, compared to the scope of the galaxy, but said the data so far shows “about 24% of the stars harbor potentially habitable planets that are about 1. 6 times the size of the Earth”. Future missions will significantly add to Nasa’s data: the agency has several new telescopes slated for launch in the coming decade, including one called TESS, which will examine closer stars than Kepler, and another that will be able to detect the atmospheres of exoplanets. Signs of oxygen and water vapor in those atmospheres, Batalha said, would point Nasa toward the discovery of “truly living worlds”.  Launched in 2009, Kepler has discovered 2, 325 verified planets of almost 5, 000 total candidates. The spacecraft spent four years studying 150, 000 stars on its first mission, and then began its second mission, called K2  —   surviving several crises and mechanical problems along the way. In April the telescope descended into emergency mode, but scientists managed to stabilize the spacecraft. “Everything is looking good for the spacecraft,” said Charlie Sobeck, Kepler’s mission manager, who estimated that the telescope has “something over two more years of fuel” left to continue its hunt.

Borrowed time: US library to enforce jail sentences for overdue books
A library in Alabama has reportedly warned its customers that it plans to enforce strict new borrowing rules that include the possibility of jail time for anyone who fails to return a book on time. In an effort to recoup about $200, 000 worth of overdue books, the   public library will be enforcing a new policy that includes fines of $100, a city jail term of 30 days or possibly both, according to the News Courier. Library director Paula Laurita said the harsh new rules were necessary because offenders were effectively stealing from the library and taxpayers. “Sometimes we hear, ‘I lent my library card to my cousin,’” Laurita said. “I just want to ask, ‘Would you lend your cousin your credit card? If they go and get $700 worth of clothing and you’re responsible for the bill, would you do that? ’” Library customers can end up owing large sums to the library because they are able to take out up to 25 books at a time, which could have a retail value of $25 each.  Anyone with overdue books will have the chance to return them before the authorities are notified.  The library will first notify borrowers with overdue books via text or email. If that is ignored, a certified letter will be sent, warning they have 10 days to hand in their books and pay any fines owed. If that letter is not acted on, a court summons will be issued, WAAY 31 reported. Ignoring the court summons could result in another fine and jail time.  Laurita said children would not be targeted by the policy.

Everything I know I learned from Bob Dylan
B efore Bob Dylan came along, there were famous poets  —   people bought collections of Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton they looked to their confessional stanzas of   recollections to feel the pain and balm. Yes, Robert Lowell was a celebrity. Bob Dylan put poetry out of business. He invented the  . He created the more efficient delivery system. When I started writing, I knew I had to compete with what Bob Dylan did with language, because he preempted emotion on the page. I had to tell the truth. I had to be utter. I had to go to extremes. I am up against the sonic museum of Bob Dylan. The Nobel? So what? Bob Dylan transformed literature. Because of him, writing is harder. I learned from Bob Dylan that, if you are good with words, you can invent whatever life you want. That is the power of writing. Great authors create worlds, with cityscapes and neighbourhoods and characters that they choose. I’ll be damned if you can’t become the person you render. Bob Dylan’s masterpiece is himself, all his work and all the people it has affected. He made it cool to be Jewish. He made it hot to be American. There’s Bob Dylan in Wayfarers with a cigarette, picking a fight with somebody  —   who cares who it is? Bob Dylan knows how to smoke. He delivered a different kind of electronic mail with a Stratocaster guitar in Manchester in 1966, and someone in the audience called him Judas, somehow not knowing that Bob Dylan would be flattered. He knew how to not try before effortless became a thing. He was born Robert Zimmerman in Minnesota in 1941. The nom de plume that is Bob Dylan is the greatest work of literature ever. I learned about beauty by listening to Bob Dylan: “You angel you   You’re as fine as can be   The way you walk and the way you talk   Is the way it ought to be. ” I learned how to be Jewish by listening to him: “I can’t help it if I’m lucky. ” I learned how to get through cancer by listening to him: “My pathway led by confusion boats   Mutiny from stern to bow   Ah, but I was so much older then   I’m younger than that now. ” I learned how to be a teenager by listening to him: “She wears an Egyptian ring   That sparkles before she speaks   She’s a hypnotist collector   You are a walking antique. ” I learned how to get through heartbreak by listening to him: “I’m going out of my mind   With a pain that stops and starts   Like a corkscrew to my heart   Ever since we’ve been apart. ” I learned how to argue by listening to him: “You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend   When I was down you just stood there grinning   You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend   You just want to be on the side that’s winning. ” I learned how to be single by listening to him: “I ain’t saying you treated me unkind   You could have done better but I don’t mind   You just kinda wasted my precious time   But don’t think twice, it’s all right. ” I learned how to be married by listening to him: “You have slayed me, you have made me   I got to laugh halfway off my heels   I got to know, babe, will I be touching you   SoI can tell if I am really real. ” I learned how to be impossible by listening to him: “Look out kid   It’s something you did   God knows when   But you’re doin’ it again. ” I learned how to lose by listening to him: “I started out out on burgundy   But soon hit the harder stuff   Everybody said they’d stand behind me   When the game got rough   But the joke was on me   There was nobody there even to call my bluff   I’m going back to New York City   I do believe I’ve had enough. ” I learned what matters by listening to Bob Dylan: “May your hands always be busy   May your feet always be swift   May you have a strong foundation   When the winds of changes shift. ” I learned how to write by listening to Bob Dylan. I wanted to do with words what he did with his voice, which David Bowie said sounded like sand and glue. Yes, he is a shofar blowing for atonement, but he is also a melodic alto he sings novels. All over the world people learn to speak English by listening to Bob Dylan. Everybody loves Bob Dylan. Everybody knows the answer is blowing in the wind. Everybody knows you don’t need a weather man to know which way the wind blows. Bob Dylan is meteorologist to us all. Did he anticipate it or invent it? He is the author of the world we live in. • This article was amended on 21 October 2016. An earlier version suggested someone in the audience had called Dylan Judas at Newport in 1965.

The week’s best new TV: The Hills revisited, Beatles as bugs and slow TV
The Hills: That Was Then, This Is Now, Can you believe that it has been 10 years since the seminal “reality” show The Hills debuted on MTV? Yes, that means you are old. In this special, star Lauren Conrad catches us up on where her life is now and goes back to revisit some of the show’s classic moments and see how she feels about them now. Over the past decade, the curtain has been ripped back repeatedly to expose just how scripted the show really was, so this should be interesting. And maybe we’ll find out why she and Heidi Montag have been beefing all these years. MTV, Tuesday 2 August, 9pm.  Beat Bugs, The   cultural dominance of the Beatles requires each generation to initiate subsequent ones into the music of the Fab Four. Netflix just made it a whole lot easier with this new cartoon, where a bunch of cute animated bugs learn life lessons via 26 of the band’s classic hits, with the likes of Sia doing Blackbird and Pink warbling Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. However, Netflix isn’t going to tell kids what that second song is about, so that part of the initiation is up to parents. Netflix, Wednesday 3 August.  Slow TV, If you have ever said, “I could literally watch someone knitting for hours,” well, now is your chance to prove it. For the past several years, Norway’s public television has pioneered the art of “slow TV” where someone is filmed doing a mundane task  —   like knitting, chopping wood, or fishing  —   for what seems like an eternity. It’s a huge hit in Scandinavia and supposed to be relaxing, but there is a fine line between relaxation and boredom. Let’s see if you can find it when a dozen of these programs are available on your computer screen. Netflix, Friday 5 August.   You’re the Worst, There’s a trend these days toward shows about awful people in Los Angeles falling in love, such as Flaked, Togetherness and Love. However, the only one of them that really works is the sometimes goofy, often insightful and always daring You’re the Worst. Gretchen (Aya Cash) and Jimmy (Chris Geere) aren’t looking for a relationship and hate romance but they like each other so much they can’t help themselves. The second season, which gets much darker as it explores Gretchen’s clinical depression, is finally available so you can binge the whole thing before the show’s third season debuts on FXX on 31 August. Awfully entertaining. Hulu, Monday 1 August.  The Gay and Wondrous Life of Caleb Gallo, Since we’re talking about Angelenos falling in love, my current web series obsession fits right in. This series of   minute episodes follows Caleb (writer, director, and star Brian Jordan Alvarez) as he tries to navigate a   relationship, the straight guy he’s in love with, a friend who’s decided to go bi and a best friend who’s in love with the same straight guy. Things get hilariously messy but also incredibly real. This is exactly the sort of polyamorous insanity you think happens among unemployed actors in LA. Please, someone give Alvarez a whole bunch of cash so he can make more than four episodes and deliver them a lot more regularly.  Game of Thrones to end after season eight, Seriously, watch Crazy   already, Stephen Colbert banned from being Stephen Colbert, Seasame Street axes original cast members, Stranger Things’ second season is going to be dark

Mexican president contradicts Trump’s account of border wall discussion
Following their meeting on Wednesday, Mexico’s president, Enrique Peña Nieto, insisted he told Donald Trump, during their meeting in Mexico City, that Mexico would not pay for a border wall between their two countries. “At the start of the conversation with Donald Trump, I made clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall,” Peña Nieto tweeted. A spokesman for the Mexican president later told the Guardian that there was no discussion of paying for the wall because Trump did not respond to Peña Nieto’s statement. “The president told him clearly and the matter was not discussed further. ”  Trump had told reporters after the meeting that while the pair had discussed a border wall, the topic of who would pay for it did not come up. “We didn’t discuss payment of the wall. That’ll be for a later date,” Trump said. Trump’s campaign later released a statement that did not directly address the controversy. “Today was the first part of the discussion and a relationship builder between Mr Trump and President Peña Nieto. It was not a negotiation, and that would have been inappropriate. It is unsurprising that they hold two different views on this issue, and we look forward to continuing the conversation. ” A Trump source with knowledge of the meeting later added to the Guardian, “both parties knew each other’s positions going into today, and we didn’t think it was appropriate to start negotiating during this meeting. ” Peña Nieto had faced a wave of domestic criticism for inviting Trump to see him at Los Pinos, the residence of the Mexican president. The controversy came just hours after Trump left Mexico City for Arizona, where he was due to hold a major policy speech on immigration that same evening. The two met for an hour and then appeared before reporters to make separate statements about their unusual summit. Speaking at a podium next to Peña Nieto, Trump did his utmost to appear presidential on his second trip abroad and first meeting with a head of state as a candidate. However, in doing so, Trump seemed to continue the “softening” of his rhetoric on immigration in advance of his policy speech on the topic, which he was to deliver later on Wednesday night. Speaking at the podium in restrained and almost subdued tones, Trump described undocumented immigrants as those entering the United States “without legal authorization” praised     and   Mexican Americans as “beyond reproach” and talked about keeping jobs “in our hemisphere”. This was in addition to Trump’s concession to reporters afterwards that while he had discussed building a border wall with Peña Nieto, he did not even bring up his signature proposal that Mexico would pay for such a wall.  This served as a major contrast to Trump’s fiery and often bombastic tone on the campaign trail.  He launched his candidacy in June 2015 by accusing Mexico of deliberately sending criminals and “rapists” to the US and has since claimed that a federal judge, Gustavo Curiel, could not do his job impartially because of his Mexican heritage. At almost every campaign rally since then, Trump has held a call and response with his rambunctious crowds, asking: “Who is going to pay for the wall?” The shouted answer has invariably been: “Mexico. ” The Republican nominee has also repeatedly bashed free trade agreements, like Nafta, which he has said allows US workers to lose their jobs to Mexicans as well as attacking specific companies for shifting their operations to Mexico.  While it was speculated that Peña Nieto, who has a 23% approval rating in his own country, might berate Trump for political gain, the Mexican president took a rather restrained stance speaking before his guest.  He praised Trump for the “open and constructive” conversation they had. The Mexican president also did not directly criticize any of the controversial and racially charged remarks Trump has made since launching his campaign last year. Rather, Peña Nieto rebutted them indirectly by praising Mexican Americans. “They are honest people, working people  —   they are people that respect family, they respect the life in the community and they are respective of the law. As such, Mexicans deserve everybody’s respect. ” Although Peña Nieto pointedly defended Nafta, a longstanding target of ire for Trump, he concede the free trade agreement “could be improved”. Mexicans reacted with outrage to Peña Nieto’s perceived deference and refusal to be tough with Trump.  “I can’t recall a time in the last 50 years when a Mexican president was so thoroughly humiliated in his own home,” said Esteban Illades, editor of the intellectual and current affairs magazine Nexos.  “Peña Nieto managed to make Trump look presidential while making himself look incredibly small. He ended up accepting an apology from Trump, even though Trump never even offered a   one. ” “@EPN reinforced in the US the stereotype of the docile Mexican, who you can insult and mock without consequences. The damage is done,” tweeted author Jorge  . On Wednesday evening, Mexico’s foreign minister, Claudia Ruiz Massieu, tweeted in Spanish that the president had, during the meeting with Trump, “expressed the grievance and outrage of Mexicans at insults and offenses”. Peña Nieto entered the meeting as Mexico’s most unpopular president since polling on presidential approval started in the  . Analysts expect the encounter to diminish Peña Nieto’s popularity even further, especially since many Mexicans were expecting a robust response to a presidential candidate whose protectionist policies could cost Mexico economically.  “Peña Nieto claims he is just trying to protect Mexicans. How, by welcoming to Mexico the candidate who has portrayed them as the enemy?” said Carlos Bravo Regidor, a journalism professor at the Centre for Research and Teaching in Economics. “This is more than a diplomatic blunder. This is a mistake of global proportions. ” The event was held just hours before Trump’s scheduled speech on immigration in Phoenix, Arizona, and came as the Republican nominee is trying to pivot to appeal to moderate suburban voters that he alienated during his primary campaign.  In recent days, Trump has shifted away from his calls for “a deportation force” and deporting all 11 million illegal immigrants in the US within two years of taking office.  Instead, he has   in the past week about a potential path to legal status for undocumented immigrants and attacked the media for even focusing on the issue.  “In recent days, the media  —   as it usually does  —   has missed the whole point on immigration. All the media wants to talk about is the 11 million or more people here illegally,” Trump told voters in Iowa on Saturday. The campaign heralded Trump’s trip, where he was accompanied by Alabama senator Jeff Sessions and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani as a sign of Trump’s statesmanship.  In a statement, the Republican   nominee, Mike Pence, said: “What the American people are seeing today is the kind of decisive president Donald J Trump will be. This meeting begins a relationship where we can talk about the issues we’ve got to resolve between the United States and Mexico, as well as the issues we have in common. ” It didn’t publicize this statesmanship as much as it could have. Trump’s campaign intentionally left the traveling press corps in the United States and prevented reporters from coming along, something the campaign treasurer, Jeff DeWit, bragged about at the campaign rally in Phoenix on Wednesday night. John Podesta, the chair of the Clinton campaign, mocked Trump for not pressing for Mexico to pay for the border wall in his meeting with Peña Nieto.  “Donald Trump has made his outlandish policy of forcing Mexico to pay for his giant wall the centerpiece of his campaign,” said Podesta. “But at the first opportunity to make good on his offensive campaign promises, Trump choked. What we saw today from a man who claims to be the ultimate ‘deal maker’ is that he doesn’t have the courage to advocate for his campaign promises when he’s not in front of a friendly crowd. ”  After Peña Nieto’s tweet, Podesta revised his statement: “It turns out Trump didn’t just choke, he got beat in the room and lied about it. ”

Trump attacks Obama for using ’metal staircase’ for China arrival at G20
Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are making competing Labor Day pitches in Ohio, setting the stage for a critical month in their testy presidential campaign. The Cleveland airport offered a glimpse of how critical the fight for Ohio has become in the   to the general election, as airplanes for both party nominees and their running mates passed each other on the tarmac Monday morning. Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence, prepared to leave Cleveland as Clinton and Tim Kaine arrived. It was a   that even forced the Trump press corps to the side of the road as Clinton’s motorcade whizzed by.  “It’s kind of interesting to have all the planes here on the same tarmac,” Kaine said as he walked over to greet Clinton. “Just shows you how important Ohio is. We’re going to be here a lot. ”  The Democratic candidates plan to take part in a Labor Day festival with union leaders and workers in Cleveland. Trump and Pence attended a   discussion with union members, where Trump warned that America’s manufacturing jobs are “going to hell”. The Republican presidential nominee blamed the Obama administration for allowing companies to move jobs to Mexico. He also lashed out at the proposed   Partnership as “a catastrophe” Trump also highlighted President Barack Obama’s reception in China at the Group of 20 summit this weekend as a sign that he is not respected. He noted that Obama couldn’t use his traditional staircase to exit Air Force One when he arrived in China over the weekend, instead, using something Trump described as “a metal staircase in the back of the plane” “If that were me,” Trump said, “I’d say, ‘You know what folks, I respect you a lot, let’s close the doors, let’s get out of here. ”’ Trump also said he planned to take part in all three presidential debates against rival Clinton. The Republican nominee was rumored to be considering skipping at least one of the debates. But he told journalists aboard his private plan in Ohio on Monday that only something along the lines of a hurricane or natural disaster would keep him from participating. “I look forward to the debates,” Trump told reporters, saying he regarded them as “an important element of what we’re doing. ” As for preparation, Trump said he did not believe in doing mock debates, as is tradition for many candidates, saying: “I’ve seen people do so much prep work that when they get out there they can’t speak. ” The first debate between the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees is scheduled to take place on Monday 26 September. Trump was also expected to campaign at a fair in Youngstown, Ohio, on Monday, in a nod to the state’s role as a    proving ground for Republican presidential candidates. No Republican has won the White House without winning Ohio, and Trump is trying to overcome some splintering in the state party, which was supportive of Ohio governor John Kasich during the presidential primary. While Labor Day has traditionally been the kickoff to the fall campaign, both Clinton and Trump have been locked in an intense    throughout the summer. Clinton has questioned Trump’s temperament and preparation to serve as commander in chief while seeking to connect the reality television star to the extreme “ ” movement within the Republican party.  Trump visited a predominantly black church in Detroit on Saturday in a rare appearance with minority voters, aiming to counter Clinton’s argument to moderate and suburban voters that he has allowed a racist fringe to influence his candidacy.   The start of   campaigning opens a pivotal month, culminating in the first presidential debate on 26 September at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. Polls show Trump trailing Clinton in a series of   battleground states, meaning the debates could be his best chance at reorienting the race.  Clinton will have millions of dollars at her disposal this fall to air television advertising and power a sophisticated    vote operation in key states.  The former secretary of state raised a combined $143m in August for her campaign, the Democratic National Committee and state parties  —   her best month yet. She began September with more than $68m in her campaign’s bank account to use against Trump, who has not yet released initial fundraising totals for August.  Clinton was expected to attend the Labor Day festival in Cleveland alongside running mate Tim Kaine and   President Richard Trumka. Later in the day, she was joining with labor leaders in the Quad Cities community of Hampton, Illinois, across the Mississippi river from Iowa, where she is locked in a tight contest with Trump. Democrats were fanning out across battleground states, dispatching Kaine and   Joe Biden to Pittsburgh, former president Bill Clinton to Detroit and Cincinnati and   Clinton primary rival Bernie Sanders to New Hampshire.  Addressing a crowd of union workers in Pittsburgh, Biden, standing alongside his possible successor, told the crowd that Trump has no understanding of the struggles Americans face every day, such as how to afford college or a family vacation. He warned that a Trump presidency would bring about economic stagnation for   workers.  The destinations in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and New Hampshire point to Clinton’s battleground map of approximately a dozen states that hold the key to the 270 electoral votes needed to claim the presidency.  Clinton was arriving in Ohio and Illinois aboard a new    Boeing 737 campaign plane emblazoned with her slogan, “Stronger Together”. She has mostly traveled by private jet during the primaries and the summer but was being accompanied on the plane by journalists for the first time.  Greeting reporters traveling aboard her campaign plane before takeoff, Clinton said, “Welcome to our big plane! It’s so exciting. ”  She said she had a good Labor Day weekend, calling it “the last moment before the mad dash”. Asked her Labor Day message, she said, “If you want more happy Labor Days you know who to vote for. ”  Clinton has been pressured by media critics and Republicans alike to hold a news conference for the first time in 2016. She has not held a formal    session with reporters since one in Iowa in early December.

Obama’s veto of 9/11 bill aimed at Saudi Arabia sets up standoff with Congress
Setting up a potential override by Congress, Barack Obama vetoed a bill Friday that would have allowed the families of   victims to sue the government of Saudi Arabia. Obama cited the potential for the popular bipartisan bill to backfire against the US, its diplomats and military personnel. The bill sailed through both chambers of Congress by voice vote, with final House passage coming just two days before Obama led the country in marking the 15th anniversary of the attacks that killed nearly 3, 000 people in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania on 11 September 2001. Congress was expected to move rapidly to try to override the veto, which requires a   vote in the House and Senate. A successful override would be the first of Obama’s presidency. With lawmakers eager to return home to campaign ahead of the November election, a vote could come as early as Tuesday. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell’s office said the Senate would take up the override “as soon as practicable in this work period”. Obama, in a statement accompanying his veto message, said he had “deep sympathy” for the   families and their desire to see justice for their relatives. But he said the bill would be “detrimental to US national interests” and could lead to lawsuits against the US or American officials for actions taken by groups armed, trained or supported by the US. “If any of these litigants were to win judgments  —   based on foreign domestic laws as applied by foreign courts  —   they would begin to look to the assets of the US. government held abroad to satisfy those judgments, with potentially serious financial consequences for the United States,” Obama said. But Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, one of the most prominent Democrats urging Obama to sign the bill, predicted Obama’s veto would be “swiftly and soundly overturned in Congress”. “The families of the victims of   deserve their day in court, and justice for those families shouldn’t be thrown overboard because of diplomatic concerns,” Schumer said. Fifteen of the 19 men who carried out the attacks were Saudi nationals. Families of the victims spent years lobbying lawmakers for the right to sue the kingdom in US court for any role elements of Saudi Arabia’s government may have had in the attacks. Saudi Arabia, a key US ally in the Middle East, strongly objected to the bill. Obama long had objected, too, warning that if US citizens are allowed to take the Saudis into court, then foreign countries could do the same to the United States, its diplomats and its service members. The administration was also apprehensive about undermining a longstanding yet difficult relationship with Saudi Arabia. The US relies on the Saudis as a counter to Iran’s influence in the region as well as to help combat the spread of terrorism throughout the Middle East. After the bill passed, proponents said they were confident they had the backing needed to overturn Obama’s veto. But the administration has lobbied aggressively since then in an attempt to persuade lawmakers to withdraw support for the bill and found some members who were sympathetic to Obama’s arguments. It was unclear whether the White House had peeled off enough votes to avert a veto override, which would be a major defeat for the president. The bill’s proponents disputed arguments of a boomerang effect if the measure were to become law. Another sponsor, Republican representative Peter King of New York, said foreign governments cannot look the other way if terrorist activities are being plotted or launched from inside their borders. The support group   Families United For Justice Against Terrorism also dismissed fears that the US could become the target of reciprocal lawsuits. In the   to Obama’s veto, the White House said the system the US uses to identify and punish countries that support terrorism was set by law and is more effective than a “patchwork” of legal decisions. The bill, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, had triggered a threat from Saudi Arabia to pull billions of dollars from the US economy if it was enacted. But Saudi foreign minister Adel bin Ahmed   denied in May that the kingdom made any threats over the bill. He said his country had warned that investor confidence in the US would shrink if the bill became law. The House vote on 9 September came two months after Congress released 28 declassified pages from a congressional report into  . The pages reignited speculation over links that at least a few of the attackers had to Saudis, including government officials. The allegations were never substantiated by later US investigations into the terrorist attacks. The Senate passed the bill in May. Brian McGlinchey, director of advocacy for the website 28pages. org, said making the documents public “strengthened the resolve of   families and other advocates of justice to bring about the enactment” of the bill. He said a decision by Obama to deny the   families “their   day in court would truly stain his legacy”.

’Last battle’ against Isis in Iraq: forces mass for Mosul assault
Iraqi and Kurdish forces are finalising plans to attack the last urban stronghold of Islamic State in Iraq, the northern city of Mosul, which after a   buildup is now largely surrounded by a   force. The assault could begin as early as this weekend and is the most critical challenge yet to Isis’s    “caliphate” which had shredded state authority in the region’s heartland, led to a mass exodus of refugees, attempted a genocide of minorities and led to grave doubts over Iraq’s viability. Iraqi forces, which have driven hundreds of miles for what Baghdad has hailed as a last battle against the terror group, moved into their final positions on Friday, joining Kurdish Peshmerga soldiers ahead of an expected advance from the south. Also on the ground are US, British and French special forces, who have been advising Peshmerga troops. They will play a prominent role in calling in airstrikes against Isis targets inside the city. Isis is thought to have around 6, 000 fighters ready to defend Mosul, hidden among an estimated civilian population of 600, 000, most of whom are expected to flee as the battle intensifies. The new wave of refugees is likely to be far more difficult to manage than the war itself, with authorities and aid agencies desperately trying to finalise plans ahead of the attack. Save the Children, one of numerous NGOs near Mosul, said some refugees had died on an arduous trip to a holding camp south of the city. Aram Shakaram, Save the Children’s deputy director in Iraq, said: “Children are arriving from Hawija on the verge of death. Food in the area is running out and they are hungry, thirsty and absolutely exhausted, having walked barefoot through mountains full of landmines and Isis patrols. “Our team heard of a woman and her    nephew who collapsed and died just a few kilometres away from help. ” Kurdish forces are expecting stiff resistance from the terror group, which has already lost the cities of Tikrit, Ramadi, Sinjar and Fallujah and a vast area of land close to Erbil.  Despite more than a year of   airstrikes, mortars continue to rain down on Kurdish forces. Isis is also believed to have placed thousands of improvised explosives in villages on the road to Mosul. The mines and improvised bombs are likely to make the going slow, and and war planners are expecting the campaign to last at least one month. Isis has also used mustard gas against Kurdish forces  —   up to 19 times in the past two years. The militants thought responsible for the group’s chemical weapons programme are believed to have all been captured, or killed, but a risk remains of further attacks. The UN estimates that as many as 700, 000 of Mosul’s residents will be in desperate need as the attack gets under way. At least another 600, 000 residents and residents of the Nineveh plains are already receiving aid after fleeing the city after the Isis invasion.

Trump and Brexit: parallel campaigns built on fear, anger and charisma
Britain voted on Thursday to leave the European Union, after a campaign characterized by fear of immigration, anger over a perceived undemocratic bureaucracy and trust in a charismatic political outsider. If that sounds familiar, it’s because it is. You can’t fail to notice the parallels between Donald Trump’s     vision of America and the desire of Nigel Farage, driver if not leader of the “Leave” campaign, to cleanse the UK of Poles, refugees and anyone else who can’t trace their British roots back to the bronze age. The Brexit vote also revealed that the UK, like the US, is deeply divided. Sections of the voting population have drastically different opinions on the current state of their country and what its future should look like.  Jowls and   xenophobia aside, in appearance and lifestyle the two men do not have much in common.  Donald Trump is a     New Yorker who doesn’t drink or smoke and has never had a cup of coffee. Nigel Farage is a     cigarette smoker who grew up in the rolling countryside of southern England and has built a political career around drinking beer. In terms of background, however, the two have plenty in common. Blue collar they are not. Trump inherited his father’s wildly successful housing business. Farage attended a   school  —   only 7% of Britons do so  —   before earning millions as a stockbroker. Despite this, both have shown an uncanny ability to appeal to the working man  —   mostly by stoking fears about immigration. Trump thinks Mexico is sending rapists to the US. Farage hasn’t been as clear about what he thinks the European Union is sending to the UK, but the fact he has been hawking a billboard showing a line of thousands of huddled,   refugees offers a clue. Other Trump grievances include Washington bureaucrats making terrible deals, China wreaking havoc with the US economy and countries around the world laughing at America.  For Farage, substitute Washington with Brussels and China with Brussels and countries around the world with Brussels.  Every successfully intolerant campaign needs someone to demonise. The foreign worker who is coming over here and taking our jobs. The immigrant who is abusing the benefit system. The Black Lives Matter protester who’s just been punched in the face at one of your rallies. In America, the Mexican worker embodies everything the right perceives to be wrong with immigration policy. The Mexican worker has ruthlessly infiltrated the US with the specific intent of stealing   poorly regulated and undesirable jobs. Oh, and of abusing government benefits. In the UK, this rallying figure is the Polish plumber, a man who has travelled from Warsaw to Wolverhampton with just one thing on his mind: fixing toilets. Toilets that a British plumber could be fixing. The Polish plumber also wants to abuse government benefits. In winning the Republican nomination, Trump beat out five current or former senators and nine current or former governors. In doing so, he defied opposition from the Republican National Committee and many serving congressmen and senators. In the UK, the Leave campaign triumphed in the face of opposition from the leaders of every major political party and the vast majority of members of parliament.  On both sides of the Atlantic, this represented an epic flipping off of the established political class by millions of disillusioned voters. Which leads us to . .. Britain was hugely divided over Europe. Among   to    73% wanted to stay in the EU. Only 40% of over 65s felt the same way.  What was particularly startling were the positions leave voters were likely to have on an array of social issues. Opinion polls showed those keenest on protecting Britain from being overwhelmed by immigrants and fancy European ideas were overwhelmingly opposed to multiculturalism (81% thought it was a force for ill) feminism (74%) and the green movement (78%). In the US, older people and those without college degrees are voting for Trump  —   for policies that share much with such issues. The vast majority of the north of England voted to leave. The north is home to towns and cities that were built around industries that have long since left. Cotton, steel and mining used to provide jobs in places such as Preston, Sheffield and Sunderland.  Now, there aren’t many jobs. People are leaving, shops are closing, schools are underperforming, life expectancy is lower than in the rest of the country. Wages are lower. In Thursday’s vote, people in lower income brackets were far more likely to vote to leave. For the US, read: rust belt. In depressed areas of Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia voters are more likely to flock to Trump and Republicans in general. Washington DC. Brussels. Both can seem distant, mythical places. Places where no one outside has a clue what goes on inside. Places power must be wrenched back from, where cats have to be put among the     pigeons. Places that must be torn down and rebuilt. In the UK, the Leave campaign has achieved this. In the US, it’s Trump’s turn to try.

Rock & Roll Hall of Fame nominees include Tupac, Janet Jackson and Kraftwerk
The rapper Tupac Shakur, pop star Janet Jackson and protest singer Joan Baez are among 19 musicians nominated on Tuesday for induction in the Rock  Roll Hall of Fame.  The British progressive rock band Yes, American rockers Pearl Jam, metal band Steppenwolf, English electronic band Depeche Mode and funk singer Chaka Khan, were also included on the nominees list, which will be voted on by fans and music industry experts.   Artists must have released their first recording at least 25 years ago to be eligible for nomination. The names of the 2017 inductees will be announced in December once voting is complete.  Shakur was killed at age 25 in an unsolved 1996   shooting in Las Vegas. The   rapper, who addressed social inequity and the struggles of African Americans, is regarded as one of the most influential voices in   whose story has inspired documentaries, movies and a Broadway musical.  Shakur’s nomination reflects the growing acceptance of rap as a force in mainstream music and follows the Hall of Fame induction in 2016 of the California rappers NWA as only the fifth   act ever to be voted in.  Baez, 75, became a voice of protest in the tumultuous 1960s, becoming one of the first singers to promote the songs of Bob Dylan and singing at the 1969 Woodstock festival. Her performances of the traditional song We Shall Overcome in the early 1960s became an anthem of the civil rights movement.  Jackson, 50, the youngest child of the Jackson singing family, is one of the   pop singers in the world but is still waiting to be inducted after first becoming eligible for the Hall of Fame in 2007.  Other artists nominated include Bad Brains, Chic, Electric Light Orchestra, J Geils Band, Jane’s Addiction, Joe Tex, Journey, Kraftwerk, MC5, the Cars, and the Zombies. The inductees are chosen by fans and by an international body of some 800 artists, historians and members of the music industry who are asked to consider musical influence, innovation, and length and depth of career.

Canadian professor happy to be home after ’bitter seven months’ in Iran prison
A retired professor who was released from an Iranian prison this week has said it was wonderful to be home after a “bitter seven months” in detention that left her weak and tired. Homa Hoodfar, a   landed in Montreal on Thursday morning. She had been detained with other Iranian   swept up by hardliners in Iran’s security service. “It’s wonderful to be home and be reunited with family and friends again,” she said at a news conference at Pierre Elliott Trudeau airport. Hoodfar, 65, was questioned and barred from leaving Iran in March after going there to visit relatives following the death of her husband. Her family said she was held in Tehran’s Evin prison since June. Hoodfar, whose academic work concentrated on development, culture and gender in the Middle East, until recently taught anthropology and sociology at Montreal’s Concordia University. She was released and flown to the Arab Gulf nation of Oman on Monday before returning to Canada. She said the hardest thing was knowing her family would be worried and not being able to talk to them. She thanked those who helped secure her release, including the Canadian government and the sultan of Oman. “I didn’t feel that I would be released until I was on the jet because in Iran nothing is complete until it’s complete,” Hoodfar said. Hoodfar said the most wonderful part of her release was seeing her niece, Amanda Ghahremani, upon landing in Oman. “I just hugged her and felt free,” she said. In July, Iran announced indictments for Hoodfar and three others, without providing any details about the accusations. In recent weeks, Hoodfar’s supporters described her health as deteriorating while she was in solitary confinement, saying she was “barely able to walk or talk”. “I feel weak and frail but better,” she said. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau hailed her release in a statement this week, thanking Italy, Switzerland and Oman for their help. Canada has not had an embassy in Iran since 2012, when its   government cut diplomatic ties over Tehran’s contested nuclear program and other issues. Iran does not recognize dual nationalities, meaning those detained cannot receive consular assistance. In previous cases, dual nationals have faced secret charges in   hearings in Iran’s Revolutionary Court, which handles cases involving alleged attempts to overthrow the government. Several dual nationals have been arrested in the year. Analysts have suggested Iranian hardliners hope to use them as bargaining chips with the west.

Robert Rauschenberg and the subversive language of junk
Towards the end of his relentlessly inventive life, Robert Rauschenberg confided an anxiety. He was worried that his mission to introduce the world to itself by way of the spectacular mirror of his art could fail, not because he lacked energy or talent, but because he might “run out of world”. No one had bolder ambitions than Rauschenberg, and no one did more to breach the walls between art and life, hauling the grubby, gleaming world into the hallowed chamber of the gallery and dragging art out to the furthest corners of the planet. A lanky Texan with a penchant for Jack Daniel’s, he was still finding ways to innovate in his ninth decade, despite being   by a stroke. If his work can be summed up in a single word, it is combination: a prodigal wedding of disparate and unlikely objects and techniques. Best known for making the hybrid   he called “combines” out of litter gleaned from New York’s streets  —   lightbulbs, chairs, tires, umbrellas, street signs and cardboard boxes were recurring motifs  —   Rauschenberg was a technical pioneer in multiple disciplines, moving restlessly on as soon as he mastered a new form. “The artist of American democracy,” Robert Hughes called him, “yearningly faithful to its clamour, its contradictions, its hope and its enormous demotic freedom. ” Over the decades, he expanded the limits of painting, sculpture, printmaking, photography and dance. As a dizzying retrospective at Tate Modern makes clear, this   “loosest, weirdest artist” was a prolific visionary, whose gorgeous, sprawling work has lost not a single watt of its greedy incandescence. Milton Ernest Rauschenberg (Robert was a name he cooked up after musing all night in a coffee shop) was born on 22 October 1925 in Port Arthur, a   oil refinery town on the Texas coast. His parents were fundamentalist Christians, and as a boy, Rauschenberg fantasised about becoming a preacher, an ambition he dismissed once he realised it would prevent him from dancing, an ecstatic lifeline for a   dyslexic kid. His sensitive disposition brought him into repeated conflict with authority, starting with his father, a keen duck hunter disgusted by a son who refused to handle a gun (years later, on his deathbed, Rauschenberg senior confided balefully: “I never liked you, you son of a bitch”). After dropping out of pharmacy school for declining to dissect a frog, Rauschenberg was drafted into the navy in 1944, where he was made a neuropsychiatric technician in the Hospital Corps after once again asserting his refusal to kill. Throughout those years he drew perpetually, covering his bedroom furniture in scarlet    and colouring portraits of fellow cadets with his own blood for lack of paint. But the notion that this might exceed a hobby didn’t strike him until he was on furlough in California. He wandered into the Huntington Library and came upon two paintings he recognised from the backs of playing cards: Gainsborough’s Blue Boy and Thomas Lawrence’s Pinkie. Confronted by the swoony, enduring originals, he realised for the first time that artists existed, and that furthermore he could become one. After the war ended he went to art school on the GI Bill, sampling the Académie Julian in Paris, where he met his future wife Susan Weil. In 1949 they settled together at Black Mountain, the experimental,   arts college in North Carolina. The head of painting was Josef Albers, a refugee from the Nazi closure of the Bauhaus. His rigorous approach to colour and composition made him the most significant teacher in Rauschenberg’s life, though their native styles were anything but complementary. “Albers’s rule is to make order,” Rauschenberg observed. “As for me, I consider myself successful when I do something that resembles the lack of order I sense. ” Together with Weil, Rauschenberg began experimenting with photograms, where objects are placed directly on photosensitive blueprint paper, initiating a habit of collaborating with lovers that would persist to the end of his life. The couple married in 1950 and separated a year later, shortly after the birth of their son, Christopher. Back at Black Mountain he began a passionate affair with a fellow student, Cy Twombly, as well as developing a productive, sustaining friendship with another queer couple: the avant garde composer John Cage and the dancer Merce Cunningham. Rauschenberg described the encrusted Black Paintings and flat, shining White Paintings that arose from this tumultuous period to the gallerist Betty Parson as “almost an emergency”. It was hardly an overstatement. With the five panels of the White Paintings, he opened the door to minimalism, breaking away from the ruling cult of abstract expressionism and its macho insistence on emotional authenticity. By applying white house paint with a roller, Rauschenberg deliberately avoided incident or gesture. The works were pure surface: the first and most extreme manifestation of Rauschenberg’s conception of art as a mirror for capturing the outside world. Look long enough, and you’d start to see shadows and reflections an   ’t that inspired Cage to make 4’33’’ his famous composition that deploys silence to expose a symphony of random ambient sounds. Of all the groundbreaking years in Rauschenberg’s life, 1953 was a doozy. That spring he settled in New York after returning from a European tour with Twombly. In his   loft on Fulton Street he set about a series of paintings made of exalted and impoverished materials: dirt, grass seed that sprouted and died, mould, clay, lead and gold. He spent a painstaking month unmaking his notorious Erased de Kooning Drawing, a work of conceptual art before conceptual art had been conceived. He also began his voluptuously messy Red Paintings, chaotic collages assailed with a glorious repertoire of drips, splashes and smears. And on a street corner that autumn he met a young southern painter called Jasper Johns. Nicknamed “the Southern Renaissance” by Cage, Johns and Rauschenberg were lovers, collaborators and   a factory of two, egging each other on to ever more daring exploits. Dirt poor, they worked as window dressers, veiling this shamefully commercial activity with the pseudonym Matson Jones Custom Display. Speaking to Rauschenberg’s biographer Calvin Tomkins decades later, Johns said: “We were very close and considerate of one another, and for a number of years we were each other’s main audience. I was allowed to question what he did, and he could question what I did. ” Neither had yet achieved much purchase on the outside world. Reviews and sales for the exhibition of Red Paintings in 1954 were as dismal as they’d been for Rauschenberg’s previous shows. The only rave came from the poet and curator Frank O’Hara, who wrote presciently in Art News: “He provides a means by which you, as well as he, can get ‘in’ the painting   …     For all the baroque exuberance of the show, quieter pieces evince a serious lyrical talent. ” What does it mean to get in a painting, and what might you do once you get there? Would it be domestic or dangerous, erotic or dreamy? All these possibilities smear and slide in 1955’s sublime Bed, the best known of Rauschenberg’s combines. In lieu of canvas, he requisitioned his own bedclothes, assaulting pillows, sheet and quilt with gory, libidinal gouts of paint and stripy toothpaste. A crime scene, one critic sneered, though the ecstatic nocturnal residue is also wickedly subversive: a closeted gay man airing filthy laundry in public  . Making the combines, Rauschenberg felt he was cracking “the secret language of junk”. They could be composed of anything: a goat corseted by a tire a stuffed bald eagle. One of the very first, Untitled (Man with White Shoes) contained  —   deep breath  —   fabric, newspaper, a photograph of Jasper Johns, a handwritten letter from Rauschenberg’s son, a drawing by Twombly, glass, mirror, tin, cork, a pair of the artist’s socks and painted leather shoes, dried grass and a taxidermied Plymouth Rock hen. All the same, there’s a limit to how much world you can cram into a sculpture, and as Rauschenberg’s success grew he became increasingly fascinated by replication. Back in 1952, he’d experimented with transfer drawing, and in 1958 he embarked on a grand project of illustrating Dante’s Inferno using lighter fluid to transfer images on to paper. In 1962, Andy Warhol introduced him to a far more sophisticated technique: the wizardry of using photographic images on silkscreen canvases. Now he could reuse and resize his own photos and those he snipped from newspapers and magazines, giving him an unprecedented power of composition. Anything could be incorporated: John F Kennedy a water tower Bonnie and Clyde. As he gleefully observed of the silkscreen paintings: “It’s as much like Christmas to me as using objects I pick up on the street. ” He was giddy for them, until in 1964 he was awarded the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale. Terrified of stasis, the next day he called his New York studio and asked his assistant to burn all the screens. Focusing on any one aspect of Rauschenberg’s life risks distorting the kaleidoscopic whole. Throughout the 1950s, he was as deeply involved in dance as art, designing sets, scores, lighting and costumes  —   headdresses like “inhabited seashells” a   horse suit  —   for Paul Taylor and the Merce Cunningham Dance Company. An “awkward, but beautiful addition to my work” he called it: a collaborative antidote to “the privateness and loneliness of painting”. The possibilities of bodies mingling on a stage excited him. His own forays into the form were characteristically surreal:   in his 1963 piece Pelican with a kind of huge umbrella made of parachute silk lashed to his back abseiling from a skylight into a drum of water for 1964’s Elgin Tie. He was always pushing forward, willingly lowering himself into new elements. In 1966, he   the astonishingly   Experiments in Art and Technology, an organisation that sought to promote the   use of technology by arranging collaborations between artists and engineers. The 1970s, by contrast, were less frenetic. Rauschenberg moved to the luscious Captiva Island in Florida, slowly establishing a substantial compound of studios and houses in the jungle. Inspired by a trip to India, the most beautiful work from those years involved a newly subtle use of fabric. In the enigmatic, haunting Hoarfrost series he used the old solvent technique to transfer ghost images from newspapers on to shrouds of chiffon and cotton. The Jammers were even more simple: bright lengths of silk, slung from rattan poles, like washing lines or prayer flags. The world gnawed at him. He wanted to get out into it to scoop it up. In 1982, a project at a paper mill in China   his most ambitious work. The Rauschenberg Overseas Cultural Interchange (ROCI) was an attempt to engage artistically with countries he felt were culturally isolated. Announcing its launch at the United Nations in December 1984, he said: “I feel strong in my beliefs   …     that a    contact through art contains potent peaceful powers and is the most   way to share exotic and common information, seducing us into creative mutual understandings for the benefit of all. ” Rauschenberg had initially hoped for public or corporate funding, but in the end he footed nearly all the $10m bill for ROCI himself, selling a Warhol and some of his own early work to fund an immense tour of 11 countries, including the US. Between 1985 and 1991, he visited Mexico, Chile, Venezuela, China, Tibet, Japan, Cuba, the USSR, Malaysia and Germany, working with local artists for weeks before hosting a substantial exhibition in each country. “At once altruistic and   modest and overbearing,” the critic Roberta Smith wrote of this unprecedented project, while the Soviet poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko described it as “one of the symbols of a spiritual perestroika of our society”. No other artist could have done it no one else came close to Rauschenberg’s stamina or appetite, his outsized faith. There was no question of running short of inspiration. For many artists the avalanching awards and wealth of later life come with an unwelcome diminishing of ideas, but Rauschenberg was still avid for discoveries in his 80s. Digital printing thrilled him, and he was making and exhibiting new work with the help of studio assistants even after 2002’s stroke (with his right hand paralysed, he simply learned to paint with his left). His 1997 retrospective was the largest ever American   show. It far exceeded the capacity of the Guggenheim, spilling out into two other museums. A glut, you might call it, lifting the title of a late series a lavish extravagance. He was equally generous with what had become a substantial fortune, donating heavily to Aids research, education and environmental causes. When he died on 12 May 2008 of heart failure, the New York Times described him as an artist “who time and again reshaped art in the 20th century”. In a wheelchair, he’d still dreamed of photographing the entire world, inch by inch, asking friends to snap the most boring details they could find. Nothing was beneath his regard, and no one exceeded his vision for art as a kind of alternative planet, equally vast in scope and scale. “I’m for yes,” he said firmly. “No excludes. I’m for inclusion. ” • Robert Rauschenberg is at Tate Modern, London SE1 from 1 December. Olivia Laing is the author of The Lonely City (Canongate). tate. org. uk

Everything you need to know about gravitational waves
Ripples in spacetime, a bit like ripples on a pond, that propagate out at the speed of light. Throw something really big into the stillness of space  —   like two black holes colliding, or two pulsars merging  —   and gravitational waves created by the event should spread not just across the galaxy, but ultimately through all of spacetime. Yes. At a press conference on Thursday, physicists from the Laser Interferometer   Observatory (LIGO) revealed that they had detected gravitational waves. Gravitational waves were predicted by Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, 100 years ago. Almost everything the theory predicted has been confirmed by observation or experiment, except gravitational waves.   For a blissful few weeks in 2014, physicists working on the   telescope in Antarctica were sure they had seen a sign of primordial gravitational waves left over from the big bang. Hope ebbed though as it became increasingly possible that they had instead seen an artefact created by dust in distant space after claims of a flawed analysis.  Two physicists got a Nobel Prize in 1993 for studies of a binary pulsar which behaved in a way that could best be explained by Einstein’s prediction: gravity waves would drain away the orbital energy of the two massive bodies and these would then spiral ever closer. But that was seen as inference, not definitive evidence.  Because scientists were convinced they had to be there  —   if their version of cosmic physics made any sense. If they exist, then two exquisitely accurately measured lengths at right angles would fleetingly change as a gravitational wave rippled past. On Thursday, that was shown to have happened. The hunt for them has been going on for decades. Fifty years ago Joseph Weber dangled metal bars in the hope of detecting telltale movement that could only be explained by a passing warp in spacetime. Nasa even sent a lunar surface gravimeter to the moon on Apollo 17 in 1972. In the 90s German and British scientists began work on GEO600 at Hanover in Germany the Italians have an experiment, as do the Japanese. Gravitational wave detection at LIGO   which has an   detector that uses a laser and mirrors   began in 2002. But accuracy remains the problem: a wave from millions of light years away would distort a four kilometre laser beam by less than a thousandth of the diameter of the nucleus of an atom. Which is hard to spot. Physicists proposed LISA, the ultimate Laser Interferometer Space Antenna: a trio of satellites huge distances apart in orbit, keeping a laser eye on each other for evidence of gravity waves. Europe last year launched LISA Pathfinder, to see if the experiment was even possible with present technologies.  Because gravity waves can answer questions about the moment of creation. Astronomers look back in time as well as space. To see something 13 billion light years away, they capture light that began its journey 13 billion years ago. But no matter how perfect the telescope, an optical astronomer could never peer into the first 400, 000 years of the universe, because it would have been so dense and murky that even light could not break free of the primeval soup. But gravity waves must have been there, right from the beginning. No. The questions multiply. Why is the visible universe made of matter, and not antimatter? And why is 96% of the universe invisible and undetectable, existing as dark matter, and even more mysterious dark energy? Why does it seem to be stable? Is this all there is, or are we one of a zillion universes? Why does it exist all? This ultimate confirmation of Einstein’s theory would be the end of one set of questions, but it would open up a whole new set of puzzles.

Benghazi may be over, but #Benghazi has a life of its own
To understand the story of Benghazi, you first have to understand there are two of them. The first Benghazi is the   city in Libya where in 2012 the US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in an attack on a diplomatic station. The second is #Benghazi, a dumpster fire of conspiracy theories and nakedly political attacks, fanned by rightwing Twitter trolls and fed by the    conviction that, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, there’s a   coverup at work. The conclusive   Benghazi report has finally been issued. It has no major revelations nor any further evidence of wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton, who has already taken “full responsibility” for the tragedy  —   now get ready to hear a whole lot more about #Benghazi. A casual observer would be forgiven for thinking the report was already out there, as this is the eighth congressional panel to explore the attack, and in October Clinton sat for an   grilling on the matter that yielded so little damning information it was widely seen as a joke, with committee Republicans artfully carrying out their role as the butt. But this report was different this report was put forth by the House Benghazi committee itself, the culmination of a   $7m investigation, the upshot of which is that nobody not reached during the attack could have been saved, and further that the Obama administration talking points, while initially misinformed, were not intentionally misleading. It is, in short, the last word on Benghazi for sometime. But don’t expect to stop reading about #Benghazi. Donald Trump will continue to peddle absurdities, such as the notion that Clinton somehow “slept” through the Benghazi attack. Fox News and others will continue to raise it. Outside groups will continue to file requests for information, and Twitter trolls from far and wide will do their worst. Never mind that we’ve now had more investigations of Benghazi than every   terror attack in recent history combined. Never mind that these investigations have now cost American taxpayers a minimum of $23m, or that there’s not a single select committee to investigate the tens of thousands of Americans killed by gun violence each year. The Benghazi committee’s tireless leader, Trey Gowdy, has already taken issue with what appears to be the overwhelming consensus that his report is a dud, insisting that new information in the report “should fundamentally change the way you view what happened in Benghazi”. So far, so bad for Gowdy. The New York Times headline could hardly have read better for the Clinton camp if it were drafted by her campaign manager. And even the rightwing Drudge Report, which gave a banner headline to Clinton’s uneventful testimony on Benghazi this fall, seems to have lost interest. At the time, the real smoking gun of the hearing from Matt Drudge’s perspective was a coughing fit and slow speech, which he claimed at the time was “obvious” evidence she was  —   horror of horrors  —   taking   meds. In all the years and tens of thousands of hours spent investigating the tragedy, the biggest upshot by far has been the revelation that Clinton used a private email server during her time as secretary of state  —   a security lapse that was both unwitting and not directly tied to Benghazi in any way. The second biggest upshot is likely the personal misfortune for Kevin McCarthy, who  —   as result of his comment suggesting the entire   Benghazi investigation is a patently political attempt to tar Clinton  —   is not the House speaker. That is also likely a blessing for McCarthy’s party. If we were going to hear the end of #Benghazi when all reasonable roads of inquiry had been taken, it would have happened long ago. Instead we’ll stop hearing about it when Republicans stop trying to undermine Clinton and conspiracy theorists stop their theorizing  —   which is to say, when the sky falls down and the sea runs dry, or in a word: never.

Canada First Nations chief won’t join UK royals for ’empty gesture’ ceremony
One of British Columbia’s most influential First Nations chiefs has turned down an invitation to participate in a reconciliation ceremony with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their visit to Canada, describing the symbolic ceremony as a “public charade” that papers over the Canadian government’s failure to keep its promises to indigenous peoples. The Black Rod ceremony is slated to take place on Monday evening, in a private sitting room at the stately Government House in Victoria. Officials have spent more than a year carefully crafting every moment of the ceremony, which will see Prince William add a carved silver ring to the Black Rod, a ceremonial staff created in 2012 to commemorate the Queen’s diamond jubilee. The staff is currently adorned with three rings, representing the province, Canada and the link to the UK. Prince William is expected to add a fourth ring  —   engraved with eagle feathers and a canoe  —   that will symbolise First Nations in the province. “Reconciliation has to be more than empty symbolic gestures,” said Grand Chief Stewart Phillip of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs in explaining his decision to decline the royal invitation.  He had been asked to hand the ring to Prince William and invite the royal to affix the ring on the Black Rod. Last week he and the chiefs of the 115 First Nations represented by his organisation decided it would not be appropriate to attend or participate in the event. “The    just didn’t feel that it was appropriate to feed into that public illusion that everything is okay. ”  When the Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, swept into government nearly a year ago, there was a sense of great hope within the indigenous community, Phillip said. Amid crushing levels of indigenous poverty,   suicide rates and thousands of missing and murdered indigenous women, Trudeau had campaigned on a renewed relationship with Canada’s indigenous peoples. He vowed to repeal legislation that failed to respect aboriginal and treaty rights, committed to closing the wide gap in education funding for indigenous Canadians and pledged to address the lack of clean water and dilapidated, overcrowded housing that plagues many First Nations across Canada, among other promises. “Yet that hasn’t happened,” said Phillip. Instead, the Liberal government has repeatedly ignored a ruling by the Canadian human rights tribunal that found the government was racially discriminating against aboriginal youth by underfunding the welfare system. Its first budget  —   billed by the government as making “historic investments” in indigenous communities  —   will not deliver the bulk of the funding until after 2019. “We’re sick and tired of the lofty, eloquent rhetoric on the part of Prime Minister Trudeau,” said Phillip.  A similar situation has played out at the provincial level. “The British Columbia government has proven to be absolutely adversarial to the rights and interests of First Nation people in the province,” said Phillip, pointing to the province’s efforts to   the Site C hydroelectric dam, a C$9bn (US $7bn) project that will see an area roughly equivalent to about 5, 000 rugby fields flooded in   British Columbia. A campaign launched globally by Amnesty International last month calls on the federal and British Columbian governments to withdraw all permits and approvals for Site C, over concerns that the   tramples on the rights of indigenous peoples in northeast British Columbia.  Philip said the hypocrisy of taking part in a reconciliation ceremony was laid bare last week as the organisation’s chiefs gathered for their annual general meeting. “There were tears and     accounts of the tragedies in our communities. At same time we’re asked to participate in a reconciliation ceremony that for all intents and purposes would suggest there is a very harmonious and robust relationship between the First Nation people and provincial and federal governments,” he said. “And that’s an illusion. We decided that for us it wasn’t appropriate to participate in such a public charade. ”  He wasn’t sure if other aboriginal leaders would participate in the event and stressed that the decision was not meant to disrespect anyone. “I apologise for any inconvenience we may have caused with our decision. ”  The duke and duchess, along with Prince George and Princess Charlotte, arrived in Canada on Saturday. The family will travel British Columbia and the Yukon in a visit dotted with stops at First Nations communities and traditional ceremonies. The visit, said Kensington Palace, “will help celebrate Canada’s First Nations community, its art and culture”.

Samantha Bee takes down Trump claims: ’Massive voter fraud is a lie’
Samantha Bee has taken on Donald Trump’s continued claims that voter fraud affected last month’s elections, calling them “big lies”. The host of Full Frontal with Samantha Bee criticized the former reality TV star for a set of tweets alleging that undocumented voters lost him the popular vote. “For the record, massive voter fraud is a lie,” she said. “But this lie didn’t spring   from Donald’s collapsing pumpkin of a head. He’s a marketer. His big lies are like his buildings: he doesn’t build them, he just slaps his brand on them and tricks the press into promoting them for free. ” She then examined where the seed of this claim came from, blaming “noted Sandy Hook truther and moon landing denier Alex Jones, who despite protests got approval to build a bullshit pipeline straight into the president’s brain”. She also said we needed to go back further and look at the Republican party in general. “If Trump manages to smash America’s institutions, it will only be because GOP termites have been gnawing away at the foundations for years with baseless claims of voter shenanigans,” she said. While Trump, and some of his staff, continue to claim that Hillary Clinton’s win of the popular vote was the result of major discrepancies, Bee joked that he would have “won even   if you deduct all the ugly chicks, flag burners and Alec Baldwins who shouldn’t even be allowed to vote”. She also spoke about Jill Stein’s   campaign to crowdfund a recount in key states, claiming people should be more invested in a key Louisiana vote on 10 December. “Liberals, I know you only gave her money because you thought she’d take off with it and never come back and we all want that,” she said. “But instead of using your energy to undermine democracy, why not participate in it and help Foster Campbell win his Senate  ? You could make a difference. ”

Empty Bottle: the ’hole-in-the-wall’ that shook up Chicago’s indie music scene
The Empty Bottle opened in 1992 in a   “      bar” in Chicago’s Wicker Park neighborhood. A few months later, the venue moved two blocks up the street to the location it has remained in for 23 years hosting bands such as the White Stripes, Flaming Lips, Interpol, OK Go, Girl Talk, the Strokes and many more. It was also ground zero for Chicago’s music scene in the 90s with bands such as Tortoise, the Sea and Cake, Trans Am, Red Red Meat and Jesus Lizard gracing the club’s stage. On Friday, Chicago independent publisher Curbside Splendor will release a book, The Empty Bottle Chicago: 21+ Years of    documenting the history of the club that helped a generation of Chicago’s indie scene make a name for themselves in the 1990s and then kept on going for the next generation.  The Empty Bottle’s owner, Bruce Finkelman, grew up in Columbia, Missouri, and arrived in Chicago with a dream and very few dollars. “I think we opened up the first Bottle for like $934,” he says. The club was in the perfect location as the rent was cheap and the fans and the musicians who played the shows all lived nearby, pushed into the then   neighborhood of Wicker Park by the unseen hand of gentrification. (Real estate brokers may now call the neighborhood Ukrainian Village, but back then it was Wicker Park.) “A lot of us ended up there in the early 90s and it was a rough neighborhood, but it changes so fast it’s crazy,” says Dan Bitney of Chicago band Tortoise. “Back then, it was really kind of the wild, wild west out there,” Finkelman adds. “I remember the second day we were open my manager had got held up by knifepoint. ” The club was finally able to throw open its doors thanks to the scrappy attitude and hard work of the owners and the community. “I don’t think we ever could have done it without the amazing amount of support from the people that were living in that area,” says Finkelman. “They chipped in with painting, they chipped in the programming, they wanted to be part of the operations. ” The club opened in their permanent location the night before Halloween 1993 and was christened with a show headlined by Ohio rockers Scrawl. “I remember we played a Halloween show and I dressed up like Carrie, covered in blood,” says singer Marcy Mays. “I had a pretty good costume! I just don’t remember anything else about the show. ” Before the Bottle opened Chicago’s scene was spread around the city, as locals hopped between bars such as Dreamers, Lounge Ax, the Metro, and the Rainbo Club. “The Rainbo Club was the epicenter, even though it wasn’t a venue. Liz Phair would be in there and the Urge Overkill guys and Jesus Lizard would show up,” Bitney says. “The Bottle was really more the venue. ”  “When the Empty Bottle opened, it was this incredible moment because we didn’t have to haul ourselves all the way to the north side to go to the iconic Lounge Ax,” says Kathryn Frazier, who launched her music publicity company Biz3 out of what she describes as “a closet” in the club. “Bruce kept it cheap enough that you would just go there to drink every night, and you would happen to catch all these cool bands. It created a big community and a culture grew out of that place, because we were just there every night. ” “When they first opened, it wasn’t the club that everyone went to,” says Sam Prekop of the Sea and Cake. “There was a bit of animosity when they were first opened, but later it became like a hometown club, probably mainly due to its location. It was where most people lived. ” Now when you ask Prekop how long he has been playing at the Bottle, he laughs: “How long have they been open?”  Besides the cheap drinks, the club quickly developed a reputation for putting on memorable shows. “They booked the best stuff, and unlike a lot of bars, it was like that every night,” Frazier says. As the 1990s rolled on and labels such as Touch and Go, Bloodshot, Thrill Jockey and Drag City helped make Chicago bands staples of the college charts (“People think Chicago is like this magical place, where there’s something in the water,” says Bitney) the Bottle became the home to the burgeoning scene. “I remember the final night of a tour with Sea and Cake and Tortoise and it felt like a proper homecoming at the Bottle,” Prekop says. “It was really good. ”  The venue wasn’t just for local acts. “There were so many bands that would come over from across the pond that would play their first show there, and then move on to stardom, but they would still stop back in there,” Finkelman recalls. As its foothold in the city became secure, the owners started to invest in the club, even improving its notoriously awful plumbing.  “For a while it smelled terrible, but they remedied that,” Prekop says. “In the past you had to pick your spot carefully in the room and it would sound really great, but they’ve fixed that now, too. Now, it feels lived in and comfortable. ” “It had everything that a great bar should have  —   it wasn’t very expensive to drink there, they had a couple of video games, and there were always cool people hanging out, hipsters and locals,” recalls Steve Drozd, whose band the Flaming Lips would drive up from Oklahoma to play. “It was a great place. You could stumble in and Trans Am would be playing. ”  The club also was willing to take risks, booking bands and genres that were new for the indie rock world. “For a while they were booking a lot of experimental stuff. These very exotic European improvisers. It was always exciting,” Prekop says. They would book freeform jazz, avant pop, and post punk, and helped bring drum’n’bass to the US. “Back in ’94 when Tortoise really, really blew up, they were always flying to London, and they were the first people I knew that discovered jungle, which went on to be drum’n’bass. And they would bring it back to Chicago,” Frazier says.  Members of Tortoise set up a weekly night at the Bottle called Deadly Dragon Sound System that became legendary. “The place would be packed with reggae and drum’n’bass music,” Bitney says. “I have great memories of going there and dancing and watching bands getting super sweaty. ” “Indie rock kids back then didn’t go dancing,” Frazier says. “I feel like those guys, through their Sunday night at the Empty Bottle, really merged those worlds for the first time that I saw and they got a lot of attention because of that. There were cool things like that that Bruce would let people do. ” In addition to his diverse lineup, Finkelman and his crew managed to create a club that bands liked to play and fans liked to visit, because the club was all about the music, not just the profits. One night the Flaming Lips were booked and Finkelman kept the room under capacity. “Bruce did this beautiful thing which was he didn’t oversell the room, he undersold it,” Frazier recalls. “I looked around at the room and asked him if a bunch of people didn’t show up. He was like, ‘nah, I didn’t want the room to be gross, you know, I wanted this to be a special night. ’” It worked, too. “That show we played in 1994, that stands out as one of our favorite shows of all time,” adds Drozd, who felt as though Chicagan fans were early adopters of the Flaming Lips. “I played piano on this old crappy upright that they had there, and we played all these songs we don’t normally play. It was a really magical night. ”  Of course that wasn’t the only memorable show. There were noteworthy sets by the White Stripes, Guided by Voices, Elliott Smith, and newer acts like Vampire Weekend and Alt J. “I remember Jay Reatard playing there, and trying to steal the disco ball because I had charged him for it last time he had tried to rip it down, and we had bolted it up there so high that he just couldn’t get it down,” remembers Finkelman. While the club has evolved, some things remain the same. Tortoise still packs the house, but on weekends Bitney now takes his daughter to the club, which hosts   matinee shows. “The neighborhood has changed,” he says. “But there’s something about the Bottle. It was just consistent and that’s why it lasted so long. Everywhere else is gone now. ”  Finkelman, who has gone on to open other Chicago venues like Thalia Hall, and Longman and Eagle, knows how lucky he is to have made it in the fragile music business ecosystem. “I continually think I’m the luckiest person on the earth to be able to kind of walk through this life that I get to live in the different places that we have,” he says. “It’s really been quite a wonderful, wonderful life. ”

Republican-authored voting laws in Wisconsin and Kansas overturned
On a day that began with a major ruling against Republican voting laws in North Carolina, a federal judge in Wisconsin issued a sweeping ruling that declared a number of   election laws in that state unconstitutional. There was also a ruling against Republican voting laws in Kansas, where a county judge ruled that the state must count potentially thousands of votes in state and local races from people who have registered without providing citizenship documents. Two Wisconsin liberal groups filed a lawsuit in May challenging laws including a requirement that voters show photo identification. US district judge James Peterson issued a ruling on Friday that upheld the voter ID law but struck down a number of   statutes and policies that restricted voting. Peterson ordered the state to quickly issue credentials valid for voting to anyone trying to obtain a free photo ID for voting.  He also struck down a restriction limiting municipalities to one location for   absentee voting, time limits on   absentee voting, an increase in residency requirements from 10 to 28 days, and a prohibition on using expired but otherwise qualifying student IDs to vote. In Kansas, the order from Shawnee County district judge Larry Hendricks came only four days before Tuesday’s primary election. Hendricks blocked an administrative rule from state secretary of state Kris Kobach. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit on behalf of three prospective voters earlier this month, a week after a state board allowed Kobach to impose the rule temporarily  —   through the November election  —   without a public hearing. It applies to people who register to vote at state motor vehicle offices without providing proof of their US citizenship as required by a 2013 state law. The affected voters were to receive provisional ballots to be reviewed later, and county election officials were directed to count only their votes for federal offices, not state and local ones. Ahead of the primary, about 17, 600 people registered at motor vehicle offices without providing citizenship papers, and the rule could apply to 50, 000 people in November. Kobach’s action was a response to a federal judge’s ruling in May in another lawsuit that people who register at motor vehicle offices are entitled to vote in federal races even if they have not met the    requirement. Kobach said he would not appeal Friday’s ruling because it was too late before the primary election. But he criticized the judge’s decision. “It essentially knocks a huge loophole in that law,” he said, of its impact on the citizenship requirement. In North Carolina, a federal appeals court struck down voting laws it said were enacted with “discriminatory intent” and targeted African Americans “with almost surgical precision”. Republican officials in the state government said the decision “by three partisan Democrats ignores legal precedent, ignores the fact that other federal courts have used North Carolina’s law as a model and ignores the fact that a majority of other states have similar protections in place”. They added: “We can only wonder if the intent is to reopen the door for voter fraud, potentially allowing fellow Democrat politicians like Hillary Clinton   …     to steal the election. ”

US aid flows in to Cuba to preserve Ernest Hemingway’s estate
The new era of   normalization has brought hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of supplies into the country to build a conservation facility for Ernest Hemingway artefacts ranging from books and letters to fishing rods and African animal heads. Two shipping containers packed with   tools and hardware  —   from electric fuse boxes to   windows  —   were opened outside the novelist’s Havana estate on Wednesday to allow work to begin.  It was far from the most momentous event in the     since presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro declared detente but there was a symbolic charge to the unpacking of American goods that will be used to preserve the memories of a man who has become symbolic of friendly   relations.  Hemingway lived at the airy home known as the Finca Vigia in the 40s and 50s, and places where the Nobel literature laureate worked, fished and drank have become important Cuban cultural sites and draws for tourists from around the world. The home fell into disrepair during a half century of cold war relations between the US and Cuba, suffering under both a US trade embargo and the   problems of an inefficient and unproductive centrally planned economy. “Preserving Hemingway’s legacy brings honor and dignity to North Americans and Cubans alike,” said Ada Rosa Alfonso, head of the Finca Vigia museum. The goods unpacked Wednesday will be used to complete the first stage of the conservation facility that should be finished in the spring of 2017, said   Adams, director of the   Finca Vigia Foundation, which raised nearly $900, 000 for the project. When Hemingway died in 1961, he left approximately 5, 000 photos, 10, 000 letters and hundreds, perhaps thousands of margin notes in the roughly 9, 000 books at the Finca Vigia. Most are stored in the decaying,   basement of a guest house on the estate, but will be moved to the new facility as soon as possible, Adams said. “This is where he kept the objects that he loved, and where they reside,” she said. Alfonso said the Finca Vigia could become a model for other historic preservation projects in Cuba, which has struggled to find the resources to protect centuries of globally renowned architecture and art. She said it was thrilling to see the containers unpacked after years of trying to preserve Hemingway’s home without     supplies or equipment. “I really feel the fact of having the best materials, the tools, really having the best conditions to continue preserving the collection,” she said. “Material and tools coming from the United States isn’t something you see every day. ”

Bolivia’s president Evo Morales to run again despite referendum ruling it out
Bolivia’s president Evo Morales is to run for a fourth term in office after his ruling party proclaimed him its candidate in 2019 elections, defying the results of a February referendum. His Movement for Socialism party approved his candidacy in a unanimous vote. Later, Morales said “if the people say let’s go with Evo, then let’s continue defeating the right and continue with our process”. Bolivia’s first indigenous president was first elected in 2005, and then   in 2009 and 2014. But he narrowly lost a referendum earlier this year on whether the constitution should be revised to allow him to run again in 2019. His current term expires on 22 January, 2020. Bolivia’s constitution only allows two consecutive terms in office. He had sought to raise it to three straight terms. While this next election would be for his fourth, the constitutional tribunal has ruled his first term in office does not count since Morales did not complete the full   term. This is because in 2009 the government changed the constitution to make Bolivia a plurinational state instead of a republic. The ruling party said it was considering four ways to allow Morales to run again, including the possibilities of changing the constitution through the legislative assembly or a   drive. Other possibilities include having Morales step down six months early or asking the constitutional tribunal for another interpretation. But the opposition said any Morales   bid would be unconstitutional because of the referendum. “No means no,” said opposition leader Jorge Quiroga.

Manchester United’s José Mourinho: no longer the bright young iconoclast
In one respect, of course, José Mourinho is right. Modern football is for ever trying to read too much into too little. One bad week  —   three poor results  —   is nothing compared to his previous career. Manchester United supporters, perhaps, will welcome his belligerence in attacking the “football Einsteins” who have “tried to delete 16 years of my career”. After a start to the season in which he has at times seemed slightly cowed, Mourinho has shown that there is fight left in him. Others will wonder, though, whether an edgy   victory in the EFL Cup against a   side is really the platform on which to be mounting such a ferocious defence of his position. What does that say about how hurt he has been by the criticism of the past week? What does it say about the self‑confidence that was once his trademark and one of his key attributes? The Einsteins line is intriguing. Even said sarcastically, it is a strange insult to choose. Five years ago when he was managing Real Madrid, Mourinho approvingly cited Einstein before the first leg of their Champions League   against Barcelona. “One day he [Einstein] said that the only mechanical force more powerful than steam, electricity and atomic energy is will,” Mourinho said. “That Albert guy was not stupid. With will you can achieve things. ” Was he, in this case, using Einstein as a synonym for “genius”? Or was it more specific than that? Is he following the more general trend of rejecting experts? Was he attacking some sort of distant boffin he imagines slaving in a lab to come up with theories to attack him? Sharp as John Giles and Christophe Dugarry may be as pundits, Einstein isn’t the first word that comes to mind to describe them. It was the final line of the answer that perhaps gave the truest insight. “The new football,” Mourinho said, “it’s full of Einsteins. ” The new football? What’s that? When did it begin? Precisely what he meant is perhaps less significant than what the line implied. It was an acknowledgement of age, of the fact that there was an old football before that he, by implication, preferred, a time before Einsteins. He is not the swaggering young gunslinger radiating vigour and upsetting the established order any more. And that, really, is the problem with the reference to his   career, as Mourinho must know. After all, nobody could really call Arsène Wenger “a specialist in failure” if they took the entirety of his career into account. The jibe stung because of the clear   in Wenger’s results over the past decade. But Mourinho, too, has seen a decline it’s not as obvious as Wenger’s and he may offer circumstances in mitigation, but it is there. Between   and   Mourinho won seven league titles and two Champions Leagues in the six seasons since he has won two league titles and no Champions Leagues. It is not particularly surprising. Sir Alex Ferguson and Valeriy Lobanovskyi are obvious exceptions who skew the perception, but very few managers have success at the very highest level for more than a decade. It is a difficult, tiring job that requires constant   and evolution. The will becomes diminished. It is far too early to suggest that Mourinho is finished at the top, but the doubts are growing. In a world in which pressing, at the top end of club football at least, has become the dominant mode, Mourinho’s preference for reactive football in big games is an outlier. It is too simple to say the game has moved on, but equally he can no longer be said to be at the cutting edge. That contributes to a general crisis of image and that impinges on his capacity to mould others to his will. We’ve got used to him. His attacks on rivals, directors, referees and the authorities once provoked shock now his every utterance is filtered through the recognition that he likes to play games. That is confusing because there have been times recently when he clearly has lost control of himself only for his outbursts of emotion to be treated as part of some strategy of manipulation. Either way, the impact of his public statements has been diminished Mourinho no longer commands the narrative as he once did. At the same time, a case can be made that he no longer commands players as he once did. Talk to those who played for him at Porto and it’s like talking to members of a cult: they still regard him as a   figure. His reigns at Chelsea and Real Madrid, though, ended in rancour and there have already been rumblings at United. His greatest results have come when leading outsiders, players with points to prove, galvanising them behind a cause. It is harder to do that, perhaps, when you are in charge of the richest club in the country. And harder to do that with modern players, who for Mourinho are arguably a bigger problem in new football than the Einsteins. Paul Pogba arrived at United and announced he wanted to win the Ballon d’Or. It is one player and one interview but the focus on the individual prize did seem to exemplify a growing mentality. At some point   become interchangeable, historic identities eroded behind a   model founded on growing the brand across the globe, and when that is the case there is no reason for a talented player to care which helped him to his ultimate goal, particularly if that is the Ballon d’Or rather than the Champions League. And if a player feels no great emotional commitment to a club, if he does not buy into their cause, for how long will he put up with the abrasive managerial style of a Mourinho? That, more than anything else, is what makes Mourinho’s public criticism of players  —   three times in his past six league matches, stretching back to his final game in charge of Chelsea  —   such a concern. Where once he was a master at drawing attention to himself, of deflecting blame away from players, he now seems regularly to offer their failings as an excuse, and that at a time when players have never been less willing to accept negativity. The world has changed and Mourinho has perhaps not changed with it. He remains, of course, a formidable coach. The situation at United is far from irredeemable, but Pep Guardiola’s instant impact at Manchester City only serves to highlight the growing questions about a coach who has always seemed damaged by what happened in Madrid, who perhaps has not quite adapted to the fact he is not the bright young iconoclast any more.

Reince Priebus on Trump campaign hires: ’I go with the flow’
Channelling Lao Tzu, Glenn Frey and Jeffrey “the Dude” Lebowski, Republican national committee chairman Reince Priebus said on Sunday that when it came to personnel issues with the Donald Trump campaign, “I go with the flow. ” “Look, you know, I go with the flow based on what the campaign wants to do,” Priebus told NBC’s Meet the Press. “I think Kellyanne is doing a phenomenal job. I don’t know Steve Bannon, to tell you the truth, very well. ” Kellyanne is Kellyanne Conway, the pollster who was promoted to campaign manager by Trump two weeks ago. Bannon is the driving force behind the rightwing Breitbart website who was named campaign “CEO” in the same round of musical chairs. For a less chill national party chairman, the kind of headlines about Bannon that have surfaced in the last week could be a real bummer. Bannon’s past includes domestic violence charges, allegations of antisemitism and a mysterious arrangement in which he was registered to vote at a home where he did not live. “I’m going to get to know him,” Priebus told Meet the Press host Chuck Todd, 72 days before the election. Todd asked whether Bannon might hurt Trump’s attempt to appeal to women. “Look, and I don’t know how much of it is true or not and neither do you,” Priebus said. “And so, I don’t speculate based on what other third parties say about people. I tend to judge people based on what I see and what I interact with. ” Police documents regarding the domestic violence charges against Bannon, charges which were eventually dropped, were published by Politico this week. Presidential nominees typically work closely with their party’s national committee to raise money and coordinate on strategy, messaging and ground operations. As RNC chair, Priebus said, he speaks “every day” with Trump. Priebus, who has been noted for his gallows humor, is not known as a “   ” type. Asked in April about the stress of running a party often at odds with its presidential nominee, he said: “I’m not pouring Bailey’s in my cereal. ” He appeared to be kidding and serious both.

Tens of thousands of children at risk of starvation in Nigeria crisis
More than 120, 000 people, most of them children, are at risk of starving to death next year in areas of Nigeria affected by the Boko Haram insurgency, the United Nations is warning. Intense fighting in parts of Nigeria, Chad, Niger and Cameroon has left more than 2 million people displaced, farmers unable to harvest their crops and aid groups unable to reach isolated communities. One small state in Nigeria has more displaced people than the entire refugee influx that arrived in Europe last year. A Guardian correspondent saw dozens of skeletal babies at a makeshift camp in the regional centre Maiduguri. Many had plastic nodules stuck to their skull, to allow the nurses to attach them to a drip. Many children are so thin their scalp is the only place where a visible vein can be found.  And yet despite these appalling scenes, Maiduguri is among the best served places in a region the size of Belgium. Much of the area is still insecure because of the war with Boko Haram, and countless thousands have not made it to population centres where some degree of care is available. Orla Fagan, a   spokesperson for UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said: “You’re looking at over 120, 000 deaths next year if you can’t get aid to them  —   and they’re mostly children. If we can’t reach people with food and nutritional assistance there will be deaths. ” Kevin Watkins, chief executive of Save the Children, said following a recent trip that the entire region was “teetering on the brink”.  “We know in areas that we can get to that there are severe and acute malnutrition rates,” Watkins said. But beyond that, he said, “there are pockets that are probably far worse than the areas that we are dealing with. And the estimates are that there are probably 400, 000 children who are in a condition of very severe malnutrition. ” He said unless emergency measures were taken, 200 children would die every day over the next year. A crucial meeting is planned for Abuja next Friday (2 December) at which aid agencies will try to agree a plan of action. “And yet despite this background, this is a completely hidden emergency,” Watkins said. “The international community hasn’t responded on any scale at all. ” Boko Haram, a jihadi group, has lost ground in the past year but its insurgency has left large areas of farmland inaccessible and many roads unnavigable by aid convoys. The situation has been compounded by a lack of international support: UN funding for the Nigerian crisis is 61% or $297m short of its target. Kashim Shettima, the governor of Borno, the Nigerian state that has borne the brunt of the insurgency, said the farming that usually sustains locals had collapsed. “Most of our communities have not been able to till their soils for the past four years,” Shettima told the Guardian. “It’s just unimaginable 80% of the people [in Borno] were denied access to their farms by Boko Haram. ” As a result, at least 55, 000 people in   Nigeria are in a   condition, Fagan says. According to UN classifications, these people are at the fifth and worst stage of food insecurity. A further 1. 8 million people are at the fourth phase, which is defined as a crisis, while 6. 1 million are at the third phase, which constitutes an emergency. UNOCHA expects both figures to rise to 2 million and 8. 3 million respectively within the next year. “It’s the biggest crisis on the continent and it’s being ignored,” said Fagan. “What’s happening in Aleppo is horrendous, but it’s equally bad in   Nigeria  —   it’s just a different context. ” Widespread unemployment among displaced people has led to starvation even in places with access to aid.  In Maiduguri, which has been overwhelmed by more than 600, 000 displaced people, the Guardian visited malnutrition clinics run by Médecins Sans Frontières. Most patients were the children of unemployed displaced people who had been unable to provide them with enough food. At a nearby camp for 3, 000 displaced people, its leader, Bulama Modusalim, said he had lost count of the number of residents who had died of starvation. “Hunger is killing us,” he said, holding up a dangerously thin toddler. “People are dying of hunger every day. ” The child’s mother, Hauwa Nana, 35, said one of her five children had starved to death since they fled to Maiduguri and she feared her toddler would be next. “I can only feed them once a day,” she said. In Monguno, an isolated town accessible to journalists only by helicopter, aid groups said the situation was just as dire.  “The people here totally depend on aid,” said Mathieu Kinde, project manager for Alima, the first   organisation to reach the town after it was freed from Boko Haram control. “The host community can’t farm their land because if they go, they sometimes get killed. ” Officials and aid workers warn that if the situation continues it could foment extremism in the area and migration flows farther afield. “A hungry young man is easily susceptible to the manias of religious demagogues like [Boko Haram founder] Mohammed Yusuf and [leader of the insurgents] Abubakar Shekau,” said Shettima. The insurgency has created huge migration flows within Nigeria and Toby Lanzer, the UN assistant secretary general and regional humanitarian coordinator forthe Sahel, warned that many of displaced people may eventually try to reach Europe. “You’ve been totally focused on people arriving [in Europe] because of problems in Syria and Afghanistan,” he said. “But over the course of the next five years, I can predict  —   and I’d be willing to bet a month’s salary  —   that the proportion of people who will arrive in Europe from Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and via Niger will grow substantially. ”

Uber’s ’ghost drivers’ scaring passengers out of rides and money
China has a   “ghost driver” problem, with Uber passengers being scammed out of rides and money, fearful of being picked up by what looks like a zombie. According to local reports,   requests are being met by Uber drivers using   profile shots to scare   passengers into cancelling their rides, which means the driver is paid a small cancellation fee.  When the passenger books the ride they are shown a profile photo, numberplate and other bits of information about the driver. Given fears over the safety of     systems such as Uber, its understandable that when a   profile of the driver pops up to confirm their pickup that many passengers simply cancel the request. Should the passenger carry on with the journey regardless of the deathly face staring at them on their phone, the ghost drivers will also claim that the passenger has entered the vehicle and cancel it a short time after, again charging the customer a small fee. According to a statement given to Chinese media, Uber is aware of the problem and is in the process of collecting evidence and user reports. The company said that it has a “  attitude to scamming behaviour” and that it was refunding those scammed and was using technology to try to combat the scammers. It recently introduced   technology in an attempt to reduce driver fraud in China, which confirms that the driver’s face matches the one the company has on file. “We have taken immediate actions and banned these reported individual fraud accounts while continuing to investigate and crack down on any fraudulent behavior to protect rider and driver interests,” an Uber spokesperson told Quartz. Uber and local rival Didi Chuxing merged at the start of August, leaving the new   service with control of the new   taxi industry in the country. The merger saw Uber hand over its branding, operations and data to Didi in exchange for a 20% stake of the company.

’It’s crazy, for sure’: meet the stars of Musical.ly
Paul Mills is using his phone to   footage of his twin sons while they record their first music video. Max and Harvey Mills, who are 13, are   to music by Shawn Mendes, the Canadian singer who got his break on the now doomed Vine video app (two albums later, Mendes, 18, is preparing for his second world tour). “Bleedin’ till I can’t breathe, shaking, falling on to my knees. ” The brothers mouth the words while Raja Virdi, a young videographer who has worked with Adele and Sam Smith, moves around them with his camera. The boys stand next to each other in the skate park under the Southbank Centre in London. They wear matching black skinny jeans, bought for them by their mother, Sara. Max, who strums his guitar, has an HM bomber jacket, black beanie (Max always wears hats, to set the twins apart) and his prized white Nike Air Force  . “These are probably the only things that are, like, show clothes,” he says of the trainers later. “I wouldn’t normally wear them outside. ” By 10am on this sunny morning during the   holiday, Paul’s phone is already running out of battery. “Right now, there are 11, 732 people watching this,” he says, reading the number in one corner of the screen. “That will accumulate. ” Comments left by fans move up the bottom of the screen almost too fast to read. “Please follow me u are so good,” says marvelnick. “Love u,” says Antonia_bayramxox, who adds 28 heart emojis. I move in front of the camera and introduce myself to the invisible crowd to ask why they love Max and Harvey so much. The comments speed up. “There music!” says Jxtie. “Cuz they’re so cute and talented,” another fan says. “They’re amazing in every way,” say Finnandolivia. Brookea_xx turns the tables: “MAX AND HARVEY PLZ ANSWER THIS QUESTION: will u ever be in Surrey? ?” Xtabbycatx stands nervously by the railings beside the Thames, watching the recording. Half an hour ago, the    was having breakfast at a hotel a mile away. She was scrolling through Instagram, where Max and Harvey have almost 250, 000 followers, when she dropped her toast. “I saw their picture and they said they were here and I just freaked out and left breakfast and dragged Dad out,” says Tabitha Wilson, the girl’s real name. She and her dad, Darren, 50, are visiting London from Stafford. She was hyperventilating as they crossed Blackfriars Bridge, Darren says. But why? “I watch them all the time, and they just make me happy,” his daughter explains. “They’re funny and they’re really good singers and they just make me smile, and I wanted to see them. ” The digital adoration is still draining Paul’s battery. Next to the comments, emojis from fans bubble up from the bottom of the screen in a fizz of cakes, pumpkins and cherries. Another number keeps count of these “likes”. When Paul ends the broadcast after 35 minutes, fans have deposited 1. 96m emojis. Almost 100, 000 people have tuned in at some point, a figure that would delight most TV channels at this time of day. Paul plans to do more   later, “when America wakes up”. But first he needs to charge his phone. Max and Harvey are Britain’s biggest Musers, the name given to the users of Musical. ly, an insanely popular social music app. Launched in Shanghai in 2014, it began to take off last year and has quietly hit the phones of more than 140m users. That’s almost half the number of people who use Twitter, which took three years to build up a comparable following. At its simplest, Musical. ly is a music video maker combining features of Snapchat, Instagram and Vine. Its founder, Alex Zhu, came up with the idea after spotting teens on a train filming themselves listening to music on headphones. In the app, Musers choose from a library of more than a million songs, select a   snippet, then   to it exuberantly while filming themselves, typically in selfie mode. Increasingly, people perform comedy skits, dances or   to film dialogue. Some, such as Max and Harvey, sing for real as well as  . They can add filters and   face adornments (selecting “swag” adds a gold chain and a black cap). Musical. lys, as the looping clips are known, are then shared with followers. Live. ly, launched in June, a   sister app, gives Musers the freedom to broadcast anything, for 20 minutes at a time on average. The twins lead a tribe of 2. 5m Musers in the UK, most of them aged 13 to 24. At the time of writing, their joint account has 2. 48m followers (they gain about 10, 000 new fans a day). They never drop off the top of the UK leaderboard, and routinely feature in the global top 10. In the US, home to half of all Musers, the biggest stars have more than 10m fans. Musical. ly, which has about 120 staff in Shanghai and Los Angeles, estimates that half of all American teenagers now have the app. Teen by teen, it is holding up a mirror to a new generation of digital natives, and changing the music industry. Musical. ly features videos it likes on the app’s homepage the sudden exposure means Musers can get very big, very quickly. The app’s biggest stars now have agents, merchandise and, in some cases, record deals. It’s why Max and Harvey, who signed up in March, are making a   music video, with their own voices  —   they want to take their success to the next level. Today’s shoot, and a session in a recording studio yesterday, have been arranged by Cassie Petrey, who runs Crowdsurf, a digital marketing firm in Los Angeles, and Tim Byrne, the British former creative director at Syco Entertainment, Simon Cowell’s label (Byrne now runs Fandom Management, also based in LA). When Petrey was 12 and at school in Kentucky, she made an online Backstreet Boys fanzine. Years later, while working for record labels in Nashville, she alerted executives to a new website called Myspace, and ran pages for artists. Now 30, but “still a fangirl at heart” she looks for talent on Musical. ly. She says the app is changing the game. “Max and Harvey did a Live. ly a couple of days ago, and there were, like, 50, 000 people watching it at once,” she says by phone (the boys were fooling around at Alton Towers). “I’ve never seen   figures like that on any platform. ” Musical. ly also has a uniquely young audience, which partly explains the sense, outside the app, of a quiet rise to prominence. “I see kids commenting all the time that they can’t follow talent on other platforms, because their parents only let them use Musical. ly,” Petrey says. Max and Harvey had about 150, 000 followers when Petrey spotted them. She says she knew immediately that they could be stars. Her job now is to work on their digital output beyond Musical. ly (they need no help there). They now have almost 10 social media profiles, including a YouTube channel (3. 9m views and counting). Engagement is the buzzword in this world, and Musical. ly succeeds by appearing to blur the line between idols and idolisers. Popular Musers are part of the community that sustains them, and a couple of featured clips can be all it takes for anyone to make it big. Really big. First came YouTube, where Justin Bieber put up his first video almost a decade ago, then Vine. “Now people are saying, ‘I want to be a Muser’ and we have the resources to make that happen,” says Tiffany Au, 28, director of communications at Collab, a “digital talent network and entertainment studio” in LA. The firm helps about 400 digital creators, including Ariel Martin, better known as Baby Ariel. She is from South Florida, has just turned 16 and is by some distance Musical. ly’s biggest star with  —   let’s just check the latest figure  —   15m fans. She got the app a little over a year ago, after a friend showed it to her. In those early days, Musers were uploading static  . “I was like, how do I make this interesting,” Baby Ariel says, “so I decided to use hand motions and thought, oh, this is actually pretty cool. ” She has turned phone holding into an art form, and has been imitated by millions of Musers. In one recent clip, she   to the Chainsmokers’ hit Closer (it ambitiously rhymes “back seat of your Rover” with “tattoo on your shoulder”). Turning her phone into a choreographic aid, she makes it move around her face in time with the music, like a hummingbird sizing up a flower. While she chews gum through an exaggerated smile, mouthing the words “so baby pull me closer” she uses her free hand to draw the camera in. She says her clips can take between 20 and 90 minutes to create. Before long, Baby Ariel was getting recognised. “This girl came up to me in Old Navy and I was like, ‘No way, this is crazy. This is not a real thing’. ” She later left school to study online, so that she could devote more time to Musical. ly, alongside her mother Sharon. She is now a “social media influencer” with aspirations to act. She speaks to me from LA between auditions at Disney and Nickelodeon. She is also in town to join Jacob Sartorius on his US tour. Sartorius, 14, has more than 12m fans, and now records original music. Sweatshirt, his first single (“Girl, you can wear my sweatshirt, ’cause you’re the only one I hold, And I don’t want you to be cold”) made the iTunes top 10 and has more than 35m YouTube views. At the Troubadour club in Santa Monica, where, in 1970, Neil Diamond introduced Elton John to America, Baby Ariel DJ’d while Jacob Sartorius of Oklahoma performed Sweatshirt to a sellout crowd. Fans are desperate to meet star Musers  —   and each other. When    Violet Summersby noticed this in comments, she arranged a   in New York. A dozen or so big names mingled with about 300 fans. Fifteen free events followed in cities across the US. Now the   and CEO of Muser Movement, Summersby hosted the first ticketed   in LA in November. As well as encouraging engagement, she believes the app reflects a healthier relationship between young people and social media. “It doesn’t matter what you look like,” she says. “If you’re funny or you’ve got something to say, you can put it out there. Social media is changing now. There was this idea that you had to look like Kim Kardashian to be famous. That’s not the case any more. You can be whoever you want to be, and that’s now acceptable. It’s not acceptable to be something that you’re not. People want to see your true self. ” It’s a stirring vision, but it doesn’t immediately square with the high proportion of telegenic,   teens among Musical. ly’s upper ranks, or with concerns about safety and privacy on the app. It is also clear that a significant proportion of Musers are younger than 13, the minimum age for app store downloads. There have been sporadic reports of attempted grooming via the app, and concerns about inappropriate lyrics and content at least two UK police forces have reportedly investigated complaints by parents. But Musical. ly encourages parents to monitor use of the app, and says it removes inappropriate content within 15 minutes it adds that concerned Musers or their parents should consider sacrificing potential fame and make their accounts private. All those I speak to, however, report seeing less nasty stuff, if any at all, on Musical. ly than elsewhere. Moreover, even if the top Musers resemble the glossy Mickey Mouse Club stars of yore, they believe that, for now at least, Musical. ly offers a freedom of expression and control that would have been alien to Britney Spears. “Musical. ly has allowed me to find who I am as a person,” Baby Ariel says. “Before social media, I didn’t know who I was or what I wanted to do. Now I do. ” Where Musers find freedom and community, the music industry sees dollar signs. All the major labels make their tracks available on the app, which mobilises a bedroom battalion of promoters. In August, the label Republic reported a 23% increase in sales of Hailee Steinfeld’s Starving after a promotion on Musical. ly. In the UK, Olly Murs of X Factor fame launched a #Challenge, another popular feature of the app, to promote a single on his new album 24 HRS. He   to Grow Up while wearing face filters, including a teddy bear’s nose. “Create your own ‘Grow Up’   video  you could win a signed copy of 24 HRS,” he wrote under his Musical. ly. Thousands of Musers have done so, adding the #GrowUpChallenge hashtag to their own clips and multiplying Murs’ audience. At the time of writing, Max and Harvey have made the   clip. The established stars courting Musers are at risk of being outshone. Baby Ariel now has almost 2m subscribers to her YouTube channel, roughly the same as Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez and Shawn Mendes, perhaps the biggest conventional singers going for the same demographic. “We had an event at Disney, and all these Disney stars were there on the red carpet, but all the fans were around Baby Ariel,” says Alex Hofmann, Musical. ly’s   head of operations in North America. In October, Ariel made the cover of Billboard magazine. Thanks to Live. ly, the   app, Musers are also cashing in. Those who stream footage through the app can receive special gift emojis that fans buy for cash as   purchases. iTunes and Musical. ly get a cut the rest goes to the recipient, who may reward the gift with a BFF (best fan forever) award. According to the company, the top 10 Live. ly users have each made $46, 000 on average over a   period. “People are quitting jobs to do it ” Hofmann says. Back on the banks of the Thames, Max and Harvey have moved location to the London Eye. Another superfan turns up. Milly Fincher, 13, is shaking with excitement. She had been watching the skate park Live. ly at home and begged her dad, David, to bring her into London from Surbiton. During a break in filming, she meets her heroes and is speechless. They greet her like pros. “So your name’s Milly, yeah?” Max says. She nods. “Awesome. How old are you?” She tells them. “Awesome. Would you like a picture?” They pose together. Milly posts the picture to her Instagram later: “So this happened, and I’m gonna be in a newspaper with them!” she writes, adding five screaming emojis. “It’s still crazy, for sure,” Max says while considering fame on the way to Wagamama for a lunch break (they wanted Nando’s, but it’s a bit of a walk). “Six months ago, no one would have ever approached us unless they were asking for directions,” he adds, while Harvey plays Pokémon Go, occasionally glancing up to check for obstacles. “Now, people are asking people for directions for where to find us. ” Fame has started to change family life, even if the money hasn’t  —   yet. The boys’ PO box address receives about a dozen items a day, including chocolates, fan fiction and artwork. I ask them if Paul is secretly a pushy parent. He used to be a singer himself  —   musicals, mainly  —   and met Sara while performing on a cruise ship. He gave it up to support a family that also includes two younger children, and now works for a double glazing company. Max and Harvey laugh at the question. “Help me!” Harvey mouths silently, pretending to be a hostage. “Part of me thinks I’d love to pause this now and come back to it when they’re 18, and had a bit more of a chance to grow,” Paul says. But the boys are way ahead. I ask where they’d like to be in five years, at 18. “Well, that’s probably when we’d like to be touring globally,” Max says. Paul almost chokes on his noodles. “Shush, Dad!” Max says. “Yeah, then five years later, we’ll run for president,” Harvey chips in. “Yeah, then we’ll build a massive wall,” his brother adds. Where would they build it? “Erm, between me and my brother in our bedroom,” he says. Now all three Mills boys are laughing, before Virdi, the video guy, checks his watch. It’s time to go back outside and film the last shots.

California wildfire: 80,000 evacuated amid ferocious blaze and fire tornadoes
An explosive wildfire fanned by a heatwave and strong winds has ripped through rural communities outside Los Angeles, unleashing fire tornadoes and triggering evacuation orders for more than 80, 000 people. The   Blue Cut fire flared 60 miles east of Los Angeles on Tuesday and by Wednesday morning had grown to 46 sq miles, spreading at a speed and ferocity which triggered chaotic scenes as residents scrambled to flee. The flames consumed homes and businesses, including a McDonald’s and the Summit Inn, a famous roadside diner on historic Route 66. It was the latest casualty in what is turning out to be a wild fire season in California. More than 1, 300 firefighters backed by 10 air tankers and 15 helicopters dug trenches and sprayed water and retardant but authorities said the fire, named after a trail called Blue Cut where it began, was “0% contained”. The smoke could be seen from Las Vegas and Huntington Beach. The National Weather Service warned that conditions would not improve, amid temperatures of up to 100F (37C) with gusty south to   winds and humidity levels as low as 3%. Television footage captured a fire tornado, more accurately known as a fire whirl, a phenomenon in which flames and gusts combine to form whirling eddies. “It hit hard, it hit fast, it hit with an intensity we haven’t seen before,” Mike Wakoski, the firefighting incident commander, told a press conference. San Bernardino fire chief Mark Hartwig warned evacuees to prepare for bad news. “A lot of homes lost there will be a lot of families that come home to nothing. ” California’s governor, Jerry Brown, declared a state of emergency in San Bernardino County. The Red Cross set up emergency shelters for evacuees, including several for animals. “There is imminent threat to public safety, rail traffic and structures. Please follow the evacuation instructions, as this is a very quickly growing wildfire,” said the state incident information system. “An estimated 34, 500 homes and 82, 640 people are being affected by the evacuation warnings. ” Sheriff’s deputies scrambled to enforce mandatory evacuation orders for rural communities in Baldy Mesa, Lytle Creek, Wrightwood, Old Cajon Road, Lone Pine Canyon, West Cajon Valley and Swarthout Canyon. Only about half of the 4, 500 residents of the threatened town of Wrightwood left, the Associated Press reported. “This is not the time to mess around,” said Mark Peebles, a San Bernardino County fire department battalion chief. Wakoski, the incident commander, echoed the sentiment. “If we ask you to leave, you have to leave. ” James Quigg, a photographer with the Daily Press in Victorville, witnessed the fire explode from just 15 acres to cover miles of canyon and hillside. “I saw all sorts of areas where I figured, ‘OK, the firefighters will use this as a line break, or they’ll use that as a fire break.’ And the fire just kept hopping over them,” he told KPCC. “And then it was like, whoa, this is going to be a problem. I’ve seen several fires in the past. I have never seen, you know, the flames burn so high and so close and right up to the freeway. ” Another photographer showed people apparently running towards a burning property in an effort to retrieve possessions. Flames briefly trapped six firefighters who were defending homes in Swarthout Canyon. They found shelter but two suffered minor injuries, officials said. Strong gusts,   terrain and southern California’s   heat wave fuelled the flames. The fire shut down a section of Interstate 15, the main highway between southern California and Las Vegas, complicating evacuations. It was the latest blaze in what is proving to be an especially destructive, unpredictable fire season in western states. Recent fires have claimed hundreds of homes and killed eight people in California  —   an ominous record because fire season peaks in autumn with the arrival of hot Santa Ana winds. It’s part of a trend of drier winters, warmer springs and hotter summers. Climate change has extended the west’s traditional fire season by 78 days since the 1970s, running from June to October. Fires start earlier and burn longer. The US’s lower 48 states just experienced the hottest June on record, surpassing 1933 dust bowl records, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Five health myths reinvestigated
The    campaign has been running, in one form or another, in the UK since 1993. You may not know, however, that in this context, one portion equals 80g. What a nice, neat way, someone thought, of packaging the WHO’s daily recommended    dose of 400g. But while the tagline has been taken into the nation’s bosom  —   with people often jokingly wondering whether a Terry’s Chocolate Orange, or glass of Fanta, counts as one of their     —   obesity has continued to rise, and   consumption has declined. The cost of fresh food has risen, and   households eat the least fruit and veg. Food peddlers, meanwhile, cause mass confusion by flogging    items in random portion sizes, and by only flagging up the    eligibility of more expensive, or less healthy, processed foods rather than basic, cheaper fresh ingredients. As far as we know, though, the advice is actually sound. Some of the original hypotheses  —   about the extent of the cancer protection that fruit and veg offers  —   have been rubbished, but it is generally agreed that fruit and veg is nutritious, provides fibre, and takes up room on the plate that might otherwise accommodate a   Mars bar. (That said, there is no magic superfood, and other unprocessed foods are good for us, too.) In 2014, a study by University College London suggested that seven portions a day were necessary, but, soon after, a much larger study found no evidence that more than five portions a day would give further protection against some cancers and heart disease. Phew. No one knows where this dictum originated. A 1945 US Food and Nutrition Board document once said that we need 2. 5 litres a day, but it also said that much of this can be obtained from food. In any case, how much we need fluctuates, on any given day, according to how active we’re being, what we’re eating, whether we’re ill, and the weather. This is why our bodies handily tell us when we need more water (although old age can stymie thirst signals). Don’t listen to anyone who tells you you’re already dehydrated when you feel thirsty. Someone made that up. In 2011, Margaret McCartney, a GP, wrote to the BMJ to highlight the lack of evidence for hydration advice, including the NHS’s more modest recommendation of six to eight glasses (or 1. .9 litres) a day. She namechecked an initiative called Hydration 4 Health, which promotes the benefits of drinking extra water to the public and to doctors. Hydration 4 Health recommends two litres for men and a little less for women (1. 6 litres). It is sponsored by the French company Danone, which owns Evian, Badoit and Volvic mineral waters. A review study published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology in 2008 found “no clear evidence of benefit from drinking increased amounts of water”. The potential perks the study investigated included improved kidney function and detoxification, clearer skin, fewer headaches and reduced calorie consumption due to feeling fuller. However, the authors wrote, “although we wish we could demolish all of the urban myths found on the internet regarding the benefits of supplemental water ingestion, we concede there is also no clear evidence of lack of benefit”. It’s easy not to question this. Heat rises, after all. Roofs need insulation and so do heads. Except, now you mention it, so does any part of the body when it is cold. It is thought the confusion arose from the misinterpretation of an experiment carried out by the US military in the 1950s. It was freezing and only the participants’ heads were exposed to the elements, so, of course, that is where they shed the most heat. More recent investigations have found that the head loses as much body heat as any other exposed body part. Bad news for the hat industry. This goes back a long, long way: it appears in John Withals’ dictionary of 1574, and has been linked to a misreading of Chaucerian English in The Canterbury Tales. The original thinking was probably that fasting would cool the body during a fever, whereas eating would warm you up when you have a cold. However, in practice, we should feed both colds and fevers. Fevers speed up the metabolism and burn more calories, so food is welcome. That said, if you lose your appetite for a few days, bodies are adept at using fat stores for emergency energy. Drinking, however, is essential, and this is one occasion when you should force yourself to drink, even if you don’t feel like it. Fevers and colds speed up dehydration (which will in turn cause mucus to harden, and this you really don’t want to happen). Poppycock. Reading in dim light can be challenging, to the point of being deeply irritating. It can even give you a headache and result in tired or strained eyes. However, says the College of Optometrists, “reading in dim light or in the dark is highly unlikely to cause any permanent damage to your eyes”. Some studies have found that myopia is more common in highly educated cultures, in which children grow up doing more close work, such as reading, but the connection could simply be that richer populations have better access to diagnosis from eye specialists. Ideally, however, when reading after dark, light should shine directly on to the page, and not come from over your shoulder, thus causing glare.

Trump’s donation to Florida’s attorney general: the controversy explained
Trump circumvented Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules by routing the money through a charitable entity, the Donald J Trump Foundation, which is prohibited by law from making political donations. More controversially, however, Bondi’s office was at the time mulling whether to join a New York state probe into allegations that customers who paid thousands of dollars to Trump University, Trump’s   education company, for a real estate investment course were ripped off. Just days after Trump’s donation arrived, Bondi dropped her investigation into the alleged fraud, citing “insufficient grounds” to proceed.  The story gained some traction in June when the Associated Press reported that Bondi had personally solicited the donation from Trump to a political group supporting her   campaign. But last week’s Washington Post report that Trump had paid the IRS a $2, 500 penalty for the “improper” contribution sparked renewed scrutiny, quickly followed by a “   ” disagreement this week over whether Trump and Bondi had ever actually discussed the affair.  Not at all. The fact that Trump’s charity made the unlawful donation instead of Trump himself was “just an honest mistake” according to Jeffrey McConney, senior   of the Trump Organization. So, apparently, was the fact that the Trump Foundation’s tax filing for that year did not record the donation to Bondi’s group, but did claim that a $25, 000 gift was made to a charity in Kansas with a   name, even though no such donation appears to have been made. In the words of the Washington Post, “the prohibited gift was, in effect, replaced with an innocent sounding but   donation”. That’s nonsense, insists McConney, who said Trump immediately reimbursed his foundation and filed corrected paperwork with the IRS as soon as the “errors” were brought to his attention in March by the Post and the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Despite flak from several Florida newspapers and the suggestion from the Miami Herald that she was “bought and paid for” the state’s abrasive attorney general  —   who has publicly endorsed Trump for president  —   remains defiant. Having always insisted her office never formally investigated Trump University, and found no basis to do so, Bondi was forced on to the defensive on Tuesday after Hillary Clinton spoke to reporters about the controversy. “I will not be collateral damage in a presidential campaign, nor will I be a woman bullied by Hillary Clinton,” Bondi told Fox Business Network. Unlikely. Huffington Post disclosed late Tuesday that Trump subsequently allowed Bondi to use his sumptuous    estate in Palm Beach for a $     fundraiser in March 2014, just months after she dropped the fraud probe. The new revelation raises further questions over whether Trump was thanking Bondi, and could weaken his own line of attack against Clinton over the sourcing of her own campaign donations.

Mystery surrounds whereabouts of former Guantánamo detainee
A South American airline is asking its employees to be on the lookout for a former Guantánamo Bay detainee who was resettled in Uruguay but has gone missing. The alert about Abu Wa’el Dhiab, originally from Syria, adds to a growing mystery about his whereabouts. Uruguayan authorities have insisted for weeks that he is visiting neighbouring Brazil and that as a refugee he is entitled to leave Uruguay, but the Brazilian government has said there is no record of Dhiab entering the country. Danilo Alves, a spokesman for   Avianca Airlines in São Paulo, told the Associated Press on Monday that the alert was issued internally to employees but declined to give any more details. The alert, published by the Argentine web news portal Infobae, says Dhiab may be using a fake passport. It also notes that Dhiab uses crutches to walk. Dhiab is one of six former Guantánamo detainees resettled in Uruguay in late 2014. Then president Jose Mujica invited them as a humanitarian gesture, but for several of the men, their time in Uruguay has been fraught with problems. They initially complained the government wasn’t helping them enough and they also refused to get jobs, drawing criticism from Uruguayans. Dhiab, who has several health problems related to hunger strikes he undertook while held at the US military’s Guantánamo base on Cuba, has been particularly vocal about his unhappiness in Uruguay. Several weeks ago, Uruguayan media began reporting that he had left the country. Government officials said he had travelled to Brazil and insisted he had a right to do so. They said he had not broken any law and was not being sought. However, last week the US Embassy in Uruguay said American authorities were “collaborating” with Brazilian and Uruguayan authorities to locate Dhiab.

Carrie Fisher’s Star Wars co-stars send well wishes amid hospitalization
The actor and writer Carrie Fisher was poised to spend a second night in a Los Angeles hospital on Saturday, as concerned friends and   of the Hollywood star expressed hope she would make a full recovery. Fisher, 60, was aboard an   flight from London to Los Angeles on Friday when she reportedly went into cardiac arrest.  After the aircraft landed, Fisher, best known as Princess Leia in the Star Wars series, was rushed to the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and placed in an intensive care unit. The hospital declined to comment on her condition on Saturday, citing patient confidentiality laws. There were no further updates from relatives who spent Christmas Eve at her bedside. Amid the uncertainty,   shared their prayers and hopes for Fisher’s recovery. “I am shocked and saddened to hear the news about my dear friend,” Fisher’s Star Wars   Harrison Ford, who played Han Solo opposite Fisher, said in a statement to the Associated Press. The    actor added: “Our thoughts are with Carrie, her family and friends. ” Others offered their hopes for the actor’s recovery on Twitter using the trending hashtag #MayTheForceBeWithHer.   included Fisher’s Star Wars   Peter Mayhew, who played Chewbacca, and Mark Hamill, who played Luke Skywalker and said he and others were “sending all our love”. Other Star Wars actors expressing sympathy for their hospitalized   where Anthony Daniels, who played   Dave Prowse, who acted as Darth Vader and Billy Dee Williams, who played Lando Calrissian. Fisher had been in London filming the third season of the British television comedy Catastrophe and to promote her latest book, The Princess Diarist. Fisher used he memoir, which recounts her    experiences making the   blockbuster, to reveal how she and Ford had a secret affair. It remains unclear precisely when and how Fisher became unwell on her flight to LA.  A source who was not authorized to discuss the incident aboard United Airlines 935 told the Los Angeles Times the actress was “in a lot of distress on the flight”. About 15 minutes before it touched down the crew reported a passenger was “unresponsive”. According to the LA police department, officers responded around 12. 15pm to an emergency call involving a female passenger in cardiac arrest. On arrival, they found paramedics performing CPR on the victim. In just a few, short conversations with reporters since Fisher was hospitalized, her family have played down much speculation surrounding her illness and stressed that their information is limited.  Her brother, Todd Fisher, told Entertainment Tonight late on Friday that his sister was in intensive care and being “well looked after”. “If everyone could just pray for her that would be good,” he said. “The doctors are doing their thing and we don’t want to bug them. We are waiting by patiently. ”Asked for details of her condition, he replied: “We don’t know. We hope for the best. We certainly do not know her condition, that’s why she is in the ICU. I’m sure everyone wants to speculate, but now is not the time for that. ” There were no additional updates from Fisher’s family members or close associates on Saturday  —   although she was believed to still be in hospital. The daughter of Debbie Reynolds and the late singer Eddie Fisher, Fisher shot to stardom when the original Star Wars was released in 1977. She revisited the role as the leader of a galactic rebellion in three sequels, including last year’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens. In her first and best known book, Postcards From the Edge, she wrote about her turbulent relationship with her mother, as well as a cocaine addiction and mental health problems for which she had received electroshock therapy. She also recently started writing an advice column for the Guardian.

Kim Jong-un placed on sanctions blacklist for the first time by US
The United States has placed North Korean leader Kim   on its sanctions blacklist for the first time, saying he was directly responsible for a long list of serious human rights abuses. US officials said Kim and 10 other top officials also blacklisted were behind widespread abuses including extrajudicial killings, forced labor and torture in the country’s system of prison camps for political detainees that has made North Korea “among the world’s most repressive countries”. They also were responsible for harsh censorship of media, academic and cultural activities, including imprisoning people accused of viewing foreign films. “Under Kim   North Korea continues to inflict intolerable cruelty and hardship on millions of its own people, including extrajudicial killings, forced labor and torture,” said Adam Szubin, acting treasury under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.  The Department of Treasury said that Kim, North Korea’s “Supreme Leader” was responsible for abuses in his roles as head of the country’s ministry of state security and ministry of people’s security. According to officials in Washington, the ministry of state security holds 80, 000 to 120, 000 prisoners in political prison camps where torture, execution, sexual assault, starvation and slave labor are common.  Meanwhile, the ministry of people’s security overseen by Kim runs a network of police stations, detention centers and labor camps where suspects under interrogation “are systematically degraded, intimidated and tortured” the United States said. Kim is “rather plainly ultimately responsible for the actions of his regime including its repressive policies” a senior US official said, speaking anonymously. But authorities in Washington for the first time identified other top officials directly involved in rights abuses, including Choe Pu Il, the minister of people’s security, Ri Song Chol, a senior official in the minister of people’s security, and Kang Song Nam, a bureau director with the ministry of state security. Another on the new sanctions list, Cho Yon Jun of the powerful organization and guidance department, is in charge of enforcing loyalty to Kim, including executing those who defy his will, the senior US official said. The sanctions were announced in parallel with the state department’s release of a new report which documents the abuses throughout the North Korean security apparatus and political prison camp system. It is not the first time the US has placed a head of state on a sanctions list. Previously sanctioned leaders include Saddam Hussein of Iraq, Charles Taylor of Liberia, and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. US officials said they do not expect immediate consequences from the sanctions, which freeze the   assets of those named, and forbids Americans from doing business with them. But senior officials said that naming those directly involved could make them think twice about what they are doing. “With these efforts, we aim to send a signal to all government officials who might be responsible for human rights abuses, including prison camp managers and guards, interrogators and defector chasers, with the goal of changing their behavior,” said state department spokesman John Kirby. The senior official said there was evidence that an increasing number of people inside North Korea, including inside Kim’s regime, are conscious that Kim’s strongman rule might have its limits. “What this report does is send a message to people within the North Korean regime, particularly at those lower to mid levels, that if you become involved in abuses like running concentration camps or hunting down defectors, we will know who you are and you will end up on a blacklist that leaves you at a significant disadvantage in the future. ”

Paris to sell off bridges’ love locks and give the proceeds to refugees
For the past two years, Paris has committed itself to taking on the love lock trend, in which couples, particularly tourists, attach padlocks to the city’s bridges as a symbol of their love.  And since the authorities made the decision to start removing them 18 months ago  —   cutting down an incredible one million padlocks in the process  —   it has been left with 65 tonnes of scrap metal to deal with. Now, authorities hope that the removed locks will be able to spread some more love, after plans were announced to sell 10 tonnes of the locks to members of the public keen to possess a piece of Parisian history  —   and give the proceeds to refugee groups. Bruno Julliard, first deputy mayor of Paris, said, “Members of the public can buy five or 10 locks, or even clusters of them, all at an affordable price. “All of the proceeds will be given to those who work in support and in solidarity of the refugees in Paris. ” Juillard added that he hoped the sale, which is expected to take place next year, could raise up to €100, 000, with the remaining locks melted down and sold as scrap.    American   Lisa Anselmo, who launched a   preservation campaign  —   No Love Locks  —   in January 2014, praised the “interesting twist” to the story: “Paris has made a strong statement in this one act. I hope other cities around the world will follow its lead. ”

Fear, loathing and firearms: sensory overload inside the NRA’s Mall of Death
“A frightened population is obedient. ”  —   Hunter S Thompson, “I’m not scared about going to jail. Somebody’s got to do something to knock the fear out of these negroes. ”  —   Muhammad Ali, At the 145th National Rifle Association annual meetings and exhibits, you could see and purchase replica flintlock muskets like the kind Daniel Boone used, “wardrobe” handguns the size of a cellphone, a   1883 Gatling gun, historic firearms from the Renaissance down through the latest Surge,   jewelry,   holsters, triple barrel shotguns, and camo everything  —   coolers, flasks,   deer blinds,   and   lingerie.  There was a motorcycle with a .  machine gun mounted on the handlebar (sorry, not for sale) all manner of scopes, optics, and   technologies “ ” food products bulk ammo, precision ammo,     ammo historical exhibits    purveyors of cleaning fluids and swabs and corporate icons with slick,   sales areas worthy of a luxury car showroom.  And the flag, everywhere, all the time, the stars and stripes popping from pistol grips, knives, banners,   shawls, bandannas, product brochures and shopping bags. American, America, sweet land that we love. A photo spread for a   US gun manufacturer featured a whiskery,     caucasian male standing in   marsh with a dog by his side, shotgun slung across his back and a large US flag in one hand, the pole planted in the muck as if staking a claim. A country, a product, a lifestyle. That word shows up often in firearms ad copy, as in: “We find peace in the solitude of this lifestyle, and we thrive on all the great outdoors has to offer. ” But on this rainy opening day of the NRA convention all the action was indoors. “Eleven Acres of Guns  Gear” promised the banner in front of the Kentucky exposition center, a thuddingly nondescript series of enormous beige boxes that inhaled thousands of conventioneers without so much as a belch. How big is 11 acres? Felt like a hundred, which isn’t to say that this conventioneer was the least bit bored.  Mingling with a crowd striking for its nearly uniform whiteness, I did lapse into a kind of fugue state from time to time, a retail trance brought on by sheer sensory overload, but with all this American ingenuity and weirdness on display, actual boredom was out of the question. Old people and those less old but morbidly obese trundled about on motorized scooters, their baskets filled to the brim with corporate swag. The crowd buzz was punctuated by omnipresent promotional videos, impromptu live briefings on subjects such as “target acquisition” skills, and music, mostly country or   though I did pass a booth where Lido Shuffle was playing. A guy dressed like Zorro wandered past, then a guy dressed up as a frontier sheriff, with a badge on his vest and   on his hips. Eddie Eagle was here, the NRA’s   and   mascot, a flightless bipedal cousin of Big Bird.   Glossy signage pushed a steady visual diet of Americana  —   cowboys and pioneers, war heroes, the family, founding fathers, rugged outdoors individualism, our freedoms and the defense of same, all embodied by photogenic white people, not a brown or black face to be seen. Celebrities signed posters and flacked merchandise, among them stars of   hunting shows, Nascar drivers, pro wrestlers, decorated veterans. More flags. History. Freedoms. America and her guns, cultural icons embedded in the brain like saints in the   windows of a church: Colt, Remington, Winchester, Smith  Wesson, brands curated with all the pomp and solemnity of holy relics.  What gun culture lacks in wit  —   for grownup delinquent fun and   subversion, you can’t beat a   rally  —   it more than makes up for in design wizardry, precision tooling and a long and honorable tradition of craftsmanship.  But something’s happened in the past several decades, a kind of   fetishizing where categories divide, then subdivide into ever narrower specialties that seem to have little to do with utility. How many variations on the   “platform”  —   the civilian version of the M16 assault rifle  —   can there be? The   was used in the San Bernardino and Sandy Hook elementary school mass shootings, and again more recently in Orlando, with 49 dead and 53 wounded. It’s also featured in a 20 January 2016 post on the NRA’s website titled “Why the   is America’s Most Popular Rifle”. “The   [sic] ability to be modified to your own personal taste is one of the things that makes it so unique,” reads the post, and indeed, walking the floor of the exhibition hall I ended up   at all the polymers, alloys, finishes, calibers, stock and barrel configurations, buffer systems, trigger systems, muzzle brakes and so on, to infinity and beyond.  I had entered the realms of style that is to say, the dark swamps of consumer psychology where desire, identity and aspiration are always bubbling in a subterranean psychic stew. What kind of AR man do you want to be? Or woman, for that matter  —   take yours in solid pink or “Muddy Girl” camo?  Most of our buying these days has less to do with need than with serving fantasies and tamping down fears. Clothes do it for us. Vehicles too, profoundly in my neighborhood in Dallas you see plenty of spiff pickup trucks “hauling air” as the saying goes, driven by men with soft hands and closets full of suits. But in our terrorized, polarized, ferociously tribalized times it’s hard to think of a more charged consumer item, one as psychologically fraught, as a gun.  For relatively not much money we can buy ourselves a piece of that rugged individualism and triumphant history (“For nostalgic hunting or cowboy type shooting the 1886 Classic Carbine or Standard Rifle are perfect”) and raise a big middle finger to Isis, the feds, the gays, feminists, whoever it is we think is messing with us. A gun keeps us in character, the American character, as helpfully illustrated by all those fancy marketing visuals, which might as well be movie stills from the reel of greatest hits playing in every American’s mind. With a century’s worth of Hollywood puffing your product, not to mention the explicit blessing of the US constitution, gun marketing has to be one of the   gigs around. What other consumer item is sanctioned by the Bill of Rights? And by God according to the NRA this market shall not be infringed or treaded upon or trimmed in any way, even if a literal reading of the second amendment happens to turn up the words “well regulated”. Maybe that inconvenient phrase explains why one searches the NRA’s extensive website in vain for the actual text of the second amendment. At the exposition center I kept seeing the word “tactical”  —   tactical gear, tactical clothes, tactical categories of guns. What did it mean? “Tactical” as opposed to, uh, strategic? Then I watched a fantastically violent,   video of a “tactical”   shotgun in action. A guy in a gilly suit  —   he looked like a   Chewbacca  —   blasted his way through a series of targets that included watermelons, glass globes filled with red liquid, and fully clothed anthropomorphic mannequins, bam bam bam, stuff exploding faster than you can snap your fingers. That’s when I got it, or at least I think I did. This wasn’t a hunting firearm. “Tactical” denotes human. The   encounter.  “It’s just not the way it was,” Donald Trump said later that day to thousands of NRA faithful gathered in Freedom Hall. “It’s just not the way it was, and we’re gonna bring it back, and we’re gonna bring it back to a real place to where we don’t have to be so frightened, we don’t have to be so afraid. ”  At that instant I seemed to feel a kink in the air, a sudden gash in the   continuum, which was possibly the “gckh!” of hundreds of sales reps choking on their Cheetos. “Not . .. be . .. frightened? What the hell! Who does Trump think we’re supposed to sell all these guns to?”  Those sales reps needn’t worry. Fear is the herpes of American politics: the symptoms may bloom and fade according to stress levels or the phases of the moon, but the virus never dies. That the world is full of dangers is beyond dispute. Peril is the air we humans have always breathed, a fact of life that demands of us open eyes, a clear head and emotional  . Otherwise we’re doomed to the existential level of mice, or, as one authoritative text put it long ago: The sound of a driven leaf shall put them to flight, and they shall flee as one flees from the sword, and they shall fall when none pursues. They shall stumble over one another, as if to escape a sword, though none pursues and you shall have no power to stand before your enemies, Leviticus 26:   Your true enemies, as opposed to the imagined, the inflated, the convenient. In his classic 1964 essay “The Paranoid Style in American Politics” Richard Hofstadter did the nation a great service by analyzing our tendency toward phobia and panic, but I was thinking of another writer when I arrived in Louisville, a native son of the city, lifelong member of the NRA, and author of such   classics as Hell’s Angels and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Hunter Stockton Thompson ( ) was the wild child of an insurance salesman father and librarian mother, his formative years marked by mischief and petty crime that progressed, by the time of his senior year of high school, to stealing cars and robbing liquor stores. “I was cursed with a dark sense of humor,” he later wrote, perhaps too modestly, “that made many adults afraid of me, for reasons they couldn’t quite put their fingers on. ” These days the young Hunter would likely earn himself a diagnosis of ADD, along with IQ scores well in the genius range. Add to these a taste for risk, an acute and easily offended sense of justice, and a congenital contempt for authority, and what you have is a prime example of a distinctly American strain of wildness, the same strain that drove Huck Finn to light out for the territory, and Diane Arbus into the precincts of the damned and deformed.  “There is no human being within 500 miles to whom I can communicate anything  —   much less the fear and loathing that is on me after today’s murder,” Thompson wrote to a friend on the day of John F Kennedy’s assassination. Thus the    franchise was born, out of a cold rage that would develop over time into a tool for analyzing not just the writer’s own soul and psyche, but that of the country as well. Years later he elaborated in an interview: People accused me of stealing ‘fear and loathing’ [from Søren Kierkegaard]  —   fuck no, that came straight out of what I felt. If I had seen it, I probably would have stolen it. Yeah, I just remember thinking about Kennedy, that this is so bad I need new words for it. And ‘fear and loathing’  —   yeah, it defines a certain state, an attitude, It was a state and attitude that any number of phenomena could provoke in him  —   Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton,   the marketing of Z28 Camaros or the death of the American dream. Fear, for the damage this horror might do to body and soul loathing, for its affront to justice, mercy, love and the spirit of fun. For Thompson, fun included enthusiastic and knowledgeable gun ownership. Lots of boys like things that go boom, and some never stop liking them. Thompson, who once gave a firecracker bomb to David Letterman on the air, was one of those boys, his passion going hand in glove with his famous appetite for drugs, alcohol and other adult activities, including politics and the Book of Revelation. At times his own prophecies show biblical   vision, as in this piece titled “September 11, 2001” (dated the day after) from his book Kingdom of Fear:  The towers are gone now, reduced to bloody rubble along with all hopes for Peace in Our Time, in the United States or any other country. Make no mistake about it: We are At War now  —   with somebody  —   and we will stay At War with that mysterious Enemy for the rest of our lives. It will be a Religious War, a sort of Christian Jihad, fueled by religious hatred and led by merciless fanatics on both sides. It will be guerilla warfare on a global scale, with no front lines and no identifiable enemy . .. This is going to be a very expensive war, and Victory is not guaranteed.  The synchronicity seemed perfect. I would go to Louisville and hang out with the NRA, and in my downtime seek out traces of America’s prose laureate of fear, loathing and firearms. One morning a retired   reporter drove me around Thompson’s old Cherokee Park neighborhood, a pleasant area of rolling hills, comfortable houses and generous urban parks. Thompson’s extremely awesome   fetched me from my motel and drove me to meet one of his childhood friends, an   southern gentleman who observed that for all his alleged madness, Thompson was scrupulously careful with guns. Check out the photos, he told me. In nearly every photo of Thompson with guns  —   and there are many  —   the gun is “safe” when not in actual use, ie bolt actions with the bolt open, shotguns broken, revolvers with the cylinders out.  “A lot of people shouldn’t own guns,” Thompson said once. “I should. I have a safety record. ”  I’d come to Louisville for guns, but around town I began seeing banners for something called the Festival of Faiths, this year’s edition billed as “Pathways to Nonviolence”. Synchronicity + Serendipity = Karma, or at least a trail that seemed worth following. Friends of friends led to cocktails with some amiable Louisvillians, which led to dinner, which led to a festival concert presided over by Teddy Abrams, the wunderkind conductor of the Louisville Orchestra, which ended with all of the evening’s performers  —   Abrams, a Pakistani rock group, a   salsa band, an angelic South African vocalist, and Ricky Skaggs and his bluegrass band  —   jamming like a musical UN while dozens of people who evidently don’t dance very much (I was one) happily danced below the stage.  America is various. It refuses to be all one thing or all the other. The next day I was back at the festival to hear a panel discussion, “Face to Face with Islamophobia” moderated by Tori Murden McClure, MDiv (Harvard) president of Spalding University, and the first woman to row solo across the Atlantic Ocean (America is various! ). She began with a series of thoughtful, measured remarks about Islam, the global war on terror, and the abiding fact of the US   complex. She discussed “terrorism in context” and offered numerical markers such as these: US deaths from terrorism,   (all numbers estimated   and rounded up): And this: US deaths in   incidents involving firearms,  : 404, 496, And also this: Estimated civilian deaths from GWOT in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan,   (from neutral sources,   estimate): 1, 170, 000, Another Islamophobia speaker, Dr Ingrid Mattson, former president of the Islamic Society of North America, talked about the “great closing of the American mind” since   and its emotional corollary, as performed by people in airports freaking out at the sight of her headscarf. What’s with all these Christians walking around scared out of their skins? “Follow the money,” she advised. Track it through to the books, the thinktanks, the Pacs and TV pundits.   can be a great career move for a pol or talking head. It’s exciting. It draws attention. It moves product.  “This country depends on war as a primary industry,” Hunter Thompson said in a 2003 interview, but he might have just as easily said “fear” as “war”. Later in the same interview he commented: This country has been having a nationwide nervous breakdown since  . A nation of people suddenly broke, the market economy goes to shit, and they’re threatened on every side by an unknown, sinister enemy. But I don’t think fear is a very effective way of dealing with things  —   of responding to reality. Fear is just another word for ignorance, So with all this banging around in my head, I walked into the Kentucky exposition center the next morning and confronted those 11 acres of guns. I had definitely found the money, but so what? This is America and this is what Americans do, we make money. I wandered around arguing with myself in this vein for a while, then decided that what was confusing me was the presumption, for lack of a better word. The mashup of   lethality and sleek retail culture, a Mall of Death sort of upbeat perkiness, with thick dollops of belligerence and bravado. “Our   Brass Jacket Hollow Point rounds deliver massive expansion and deep penetration for ultimate stopping power. ” “Shoulder Bones Are Mere Speed Bumps. ” “Optimal penetration and expansion through even heavy clothing. ” “  confidence. ” “Cutting petals. ” “Deadly downrange stopping power. ” “Expands rapidly to 2X the diameter to carve massive wound channels. ”  This kind of verbiage makes perfect sense, once you accept the basic premise. Guns are machines for inflicting deadly force  —   what’s the point of the damn thing if it shoots marshmallows? It’s not hard to envision a scenario where you would want a firearm where you would feel very much a fool for not having one. The world is indeed a dangerous place. Lots of disturbed people out there, damaged people, fanatics, shitbirds, mean people with all the conscience of a starved rat. But here’s the rub: we’re much more likely to shoot our families, our lovers, ourselves than we are that marauding stranger. The numbers bear this out: you bring a gun into your house, the chances of you or a family member being killed by a gun are far greater than the chance you’ll ever use it for  .  Which could be viewed as statistical proof  —   as if it was needed  —   that human beings are flawed. We’re creatures of passion, impulse, pride, mood and pitifully fragile ego, with barely the patience to drive a mile in our cars without wanting to kill someone. Women’s mortality rises especially high when guns are around. I thought about all this as I sat in Freedom Hall and listened to Wayne LaPierre, the NRA’s longtime CEO, deliver a phrase so familiar to the membership that they recited it with him: The surest way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.  Sometimes it really is that pure, but human nature being what it is, we contain sufficient good and evil in ourselves that many of us can recall a crisis in our lives and be grateful that there wasn’t a gun nearby. Or remember with regret that there was. Just as I can imagine scenarios where I’d feel foolish and reckless for not having a gun, I can conceive of just as many situations where I’d be the world’s biggest fool for having one.  But in NRA Land the lines are always bright and clear: us against them, good versus bad, American versus villains. “We, in this room, we are America,” insisted LaPierre, whose gulpy, throttled delivery belied the clench of a man in serious need of breathing lessons. Anyone hoping for nuance or even coherence would have been disappointed in his speech, which pounded out a steady drumbeat of fear and alarm. He warned of those “other rooms” where “political and media elites at the highest levels” are conspiring to destroy the second amendment, and with it “our core values, our freedom”.  “A Clinton White House would be a cesspool for NBC, ABC and CBS elitists to plan programming and orchestrate interviews to bombard the airwaves against our freedom. ” Elitists are “shredding the very fabric of our country” “seizing and destroying all the freedoms and values we care about most” and planning to “put the full weight of a weaponized IRS, ATF, EPA, interior department and every other federal agency behind attacks against groups and people they don’t like. ” If Hillary Clinton wins, “it’s game over for everyone in this room, and everything that we all care about”.  It seems safe to say that the paranoid style in American politics is alive and well. All of the classic elements that Hofstadter described in his 1964 essay were on full and florid display at Louisville’s Freedom Hall: conspiracy, persecution, apocalypticism, the characterization of political difference not as a matter of good faith    but a final showdown between absolute good and absolute evil. “We will save freedom!” LaPierre shouted in closing. “And America truly will be America again!” He ceded the podium to NRA president Chris Cox, who announced the NRA’s official endorsement of Donald J Trump for the office of president of the United States, then Trump himself took the stage to offer his thoughts.  In that   essay, Hofstadter took pains to point out that the US has never had a monopoly on the paranoid style. As proof, he cited the one instance in modern history of the paranoid style’s “consummatory triumph” a distinction that belongs to Germany in the era of the Third Reich.  While in Louisville I made it my business to follow the trail of another native son of the city, a near contemporary of Hunter Thompson’s. I went to his childhood home on Grand Avenue, a neat, modest,   pink house with a historical marker out front. I saw the gym where he trained as a youth, and toured the museum and cultural center that bears his name.  Two weeks later these places would become crowded with people mourning Muhammad Ali’s death, but at the time I was visiting these sites out of the sense that for a   demonstration of rugged American individualism, you would be hard pressed to find a more salient example than Ali, né Cassius Marcellus Clay, who as a practicing Muslim renounced participation in that “primary industry” that Hunter Thompson talked about. For refusing military service during the Vietnam war, Ali lost his world championship title, his boxing license  —   and thus his means of making a living  —   and who knows how many millions of dollars in future earnings.  His indictment and trial in federal court led to a sentence (later overturned by the supreme court) of five years in jail, the maximum penalty allowed. With the wrath of the law and mainstream America bearing down on him, Ali still refused to bend. He wasn’t scared of going to jail, of never boxing again, of trading his fame for infamy. Faced with the loss of pretty much everything a person can hold dear, Ali wasn’t afraid, which years later moved his friend Bill Russell to say: “Ali was one of the first truly free people in America. ” As a loud, proud black man in the early 1960s who did his own thinking and spoke his mind, Ali blew out several of the hottest circuits in America’s paranoid wiring. “I don’t have to be what you people want me to be,” he famously declared. Mainstream, ie white, America freaked, and then came the conversion to Islam and his refusal of military service as the Vietnam war escalated. At a time when paranoid delusions were driving the US into a catastrophic war, Ali saw it for the fraud it was his was a mind free of unreasoning fear, which isn’t to say he had little to fear. For refusing the draft, he lost his freedom. Note: Ben Fountain paid for an NRA membership in order to attend the Louisville convention due to the fact that the NRA refused press accreditation to Guardian US.

Frank Ocean breaks silence with blog on Orlando: ’Many wish we didn’t exist’
Frank Ocean has mourned hateful acts towards the LGBT community in an emotional blogpost responding to the Orlando shooting, writing: “Many hate us and wish we didn’t exist. ” The lauded RB artist has kept away from the spotlight since coming out as bisexual in an open letter on the   site Tumblr in July 2012, the same month his   album Channel Orange was released.  Despite the album’s critical acclaim, Ocean evaded interviews and has only spoken publicly sporadically, often on Tumblr, where he has written about his sadness over Prince’s death and Donald Trump.  But Tuesday’s intensely personal post described his reaction to the Orlando shooting and the history of hate towards the LGBT community.  “I heard on the news that the aftermath of a hate crime left piles of bodies on a dance floor this month,” Ocean said. “I heard the gunman feigned dead among all the people he killed. I heard the news say he was one of us. ” Ocean continued to say the last time he saw his father was at lunch when his dad called their waitress a faggot  —   the first time Ocean had heard the derogatory word, aged six.  “Many don’t see anything wrong with passing down the same old values that send thousands of kids into suicidal depression each year,” Ocean said. “So we say pride and we express love for who and what we are. Because who else will in earnest?” While Ocean has kept quiet over the past four years, fans and the music press have been anxiously awaiting the   to Channel Orange, in part because of the artist’s hints of its imminent arrival on social media. And the latest reports say that the album was premiered at a listening party in New York City earlier this year.  The blogpost made no mention of the next album, though its personal themes were reflective of the lyrics in Channel Orange.  Ocean wrote in the post that reality seems “bleak” and he hopes that attitudes will soon change.  Ocean said: “I daydream on the idea that maybe all this barbarism and all these transgressions against ourselves is an equal and opposite reaction to something better happening in this world, some great swelling wave of openness and wakefulness out here. ”

John Prine review – legendary songwriter looks back to the beginning
John Prine walked onstage around 10. 40pm Thursday holding a vinyl copy of his 1971 debut album. “I had to pay $7. 50 on eBay to get this thing!” he told the audience. What happened next was priceless: two sets of music that spanned his   career including, for the first time, a performance of the album, John Prine (Atlantic) in its entirety. That album allowed the former Chicago mailman to quit his day job, move to Nashville, and become one of the   songwriters of his generation. You can hear why in its 13 story songs, which quietly eavesdrop on the lives of marginalized Americans: a Vietnam vet turned heroin junkie, an elderly couple forgotten by the world, a convict eating Christmas dinner behind bars, a Kentucky town ravaged by a coal company, a wife caged by a small town and loveless marriage who yearns for the rodeo. The album helped launch the   era of the 1970s and remains a touchstone for how empathy, ordinary language and minimal detail can produce the weight of an entire novel. The night was also an unexpected break for Prine, who has been touring large theaters across the US behind a new album of duets, For Better or Worse (Oh Boy). But on Thursday, abandoning his formal suit for denim and a black   Prine performed for about 200 people at the Station Inn, Nashville’s legendary den for bluegrass musicians. The wood panelling, folding chairs, and yellowing showbills on the wall fit the humble lyrics, but the music, with guitarist Jason Wilber inflecting   textures, measured up to Bob Dylan’s take on Prine: “Pure Proustian existentialism. Midwestern mind trips to the nth degree. ” The concert, part of the Americana Music Festival and Conference, was a highlight among panel discussions and special events around the city. In a city where songs are currency, at a conference where songwriters are king, and in a venue championed as a showcase for both, the night was like Christmas, New Year’s Eve and the Fourth of July wrapped into one. Prine turns 70 in October and has survived two bouts with cancer, with scars visible on his neck. Yet Prine growls his words softly, his voice ragged but not rough. When he delivers the grim coda of Six O’Clock News  —   “His brains were on the sidewalk and blood was on his shoes”  —   it is with    resignation, the saddest kind of horror.  With Wilber and longtime bassist Dave Jacques at his sides, Prine expanded his touring band with a Jack White sideman, Fats Kaplin, on fiddle, accordion and pedal steel guitar, the   Pat McLaughlin on mandolin, and the drummer Kenneth Blevins. On Hello in There, their playing brought the room to silence. As Jacques stretched a long bow across his acoustic bass and Kaplan let notes hover in the air from his accordion, Prine sang the heartbreaking lyric of an old man and his wife, forgotten by their children. On Angel From Montgomery, a song made ubiquitous by Bonnie Raitt (“If you go into an igloo and there’s a girl singer on the stage, if you sit there long enough, she’ll sing this song”) Kaplan’s fiddle and Wilber’s guitar called back and forth to one another as they swirled around the lyrics. Prine noted that, despite their 45 years, many of his earliest songs hold special relevance today. Sam Stone, written in the throes of the Vietnam conflict, could easily be written about today’s veterans returning home from the Middle East. Your Flag Decal Won’t Get You Into Heaven Anymore, another   throwback skewering   war hawks. “This one I really thought wouldn’t last for six months,” he said. “I bring it out whenever we have an election. ” But the song that holds personal relevance to this day is Paradise, written for his parents, both originally from Muhlenberg County,   territory in western Kentucky. Prine’s lyric about Peabody Energy Corp, which stripped the area for mining decades ago, has infuriated the company for years : in court documents filed last year against environmental activists, the company described the song as inflammatory. “To me, it wasn’t a protest song, but when Peabody heard it, they went apeshit,” Prine noted said. “That’s what started the war between us. ” In April, he noted, the company filed for bankruptcy. The second set featured another hour of music from Prine’s career. Jason Isbell and his wife, Amanda Shires, joined him on guitar and fiddle for three songs, including a haunting version of Unwed Fathers. Between two songs, Prine mentioned that the guitar he was holding was the same one pictured leaning against a stack of hay bales on the cover of that 1971 debut. “I bought it new in 1968 and wrote every song on it,” he said. The guitar received its own round of applause.

Uncertain economy may prompt Fed to delay rate hike, Janet Yellen suggests
Hikes to US interest rates might be on hold again thanks to “considerable uncertainty about the economic outlook” Janet Yellen suggested in a speech on Monday. Speaking at the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia, days after a surprisingly poor report on the state of the US job market, the Federal Reserve chair said gradual increases to the interest rates were “likely to be appropriate”. But she omitted the phrase “in the coming months”  —   a phrase that, when spoken by Yellen 10 days ago, many economists took to imply that the Fed was ready to raise rates soon. Among the factors that might persuade the Fed against raising interest rates next week are slowing job creation and US economic growth as well as uncertainty about the UK’s potential exit from the European Union (Brexit) and a slowdown in China’s economy. “Even though the financial stresses that had emanated from abroad at the start of this year have eased, global risks require continued attention,” said Yellen. China still faces “considerable challenges” and investors’ perception of risk can change abruptly, she said. “One development that could shift investor sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom. A UK vote to exit the European Union could have significant economic repercussions,” she said. Yellen did not elaborate as to what those repercussions could be. Yellen’s speech came three days after the US Department of Labor announced that the US economy had added just 38, 000 jobs in May  —   122, 000 fewer than expected. The disappointing numbers have been attributed to the fact that 40, 000 Verizon workers had been on strike for 44 days. The strike ended 10 days ago. “The economy added 2. 7m jobs last year, an average of about 230, 000 a month,” Yellen pointed out Monday. She also noted that wages had gone up, job openings were up, the US economy was “fairly close” to full employment and that people were quitting their jobs, signalling that they were receiving other offers.  “This past Friday’s labor market report was disappointing,” said Yellen, adding: “Let me emphasize that one should never attach too much significance to any single monthly report. ” Last time Verizon workers went on strike, in August 2011, the US economy reported that zero jobs were added. The following month, that number was revised to 57, 000 jobs, and the month after to 104, 000 jobs. The Fed’s   committee meets next week, on   June. There will be no revisions to the jobs report prior to that. The Federal Reserve increased interest rates for the the first time in nearly a decade last December and two more rate hikes have been expected this year. The next Fed meeting will take place in July, weeks after the June report and the Brexit vote. “In short, nothing too surprising after Friday’s employment report left little doubt that there would be no tightening at the June   FOMC meeting,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief US economist for High Frequency Economics. “The speech is consistent with tightening again before too long, but there is no specificity at all on timing. ”

Movies and mountains: mixing film and skiing at the Sundance festival
Bombs were falling in the distance, shaking the house like a hurricane. We were in the basement, hiding. “Don’t worry,” a father next to me told his daughter. “It’s just a giant walking through our city. ” Suddenly, a flash of blinding light tore through the ceiling and I raised my hands protectively over my head and let out an involuntary little shriek. Yes, virtual reality stole the show at this year’s Sundance Film Festival, Robert Redford’s annual shindig of snowy mountains and independent movies in Park City, Utah. At the New Frontiers exhibition, goggled people were tiptoeing gingerly across flat floors like they were on a tight rope, and a woman covered in sensors endlessly circled a blacked out room. Everyone seemed to be wired up  —   pointing and ducking at absolutely nothing. It felt like an asylum for the chronically entertained. But one thing VR can’t yet imitate is the rush of the real outdoors. Luckily, there’s plenty of that nearby, which was the other reason I was here: to combine mountains and movies, popcorn and pistes. For a   film buff, a trip to Park City during Sundance was the ultimate winter treat. This year it got a little better too. After a $50m investment, Park City Ski Resort, home of the US Ski Team and the 2002 Winter Olympics, expanded into neighbouring Canyons, built a new gondola to link the two resorts and created the largest ski area in the US: 17 peaks and 7, 300 acres of skiable terrain. Hitting the slopes here isn’t so much an outing as it is a   expedition, albeit one fuelled by hot chocolate and whisky toddies at the bottom of every run. The festival itself is a strange mix of ski bum and movie mogul. But it works. “You see a few actresses in   heels,” one local told me, with a wicked glint in her eye. “But they soon fall on their ass in the snow. ” That’s not to say there’s no glamour. I narrowly missed Steve Carell’s bum as he jumped into a taxi, and I shared a ski lift with Olympic Gold freestyle mogulist Hannah Kearney, who had just given Adrian Grenier (Vince from Entourage) a lesson  —   which was cool on two counts. There might have been more  —     is quite tricky in a blizzard  —   but the St Regis, where I stayed in neighbouring Deer Valley, was all the   I needed: outdoor hot tubs right on the slopes, a funicular railway just for getting to the lobby and a bloke who sabres bottles of champagne (as in cuts the cork off with an actual sword) every night. Eat your heart out, Vinny. But it was the skiing that really stood out. Starting at the far western end of Park City, it took me a whole day to ski to its eastern edge, seven miles away, without ever repeating a run. I raced through steep pine forests pillowed with heavy snow and frozen aspens, the Wasatch mountains rolling by in swirls of purple and brilliant white. The runs were long and varied, the snow light as air. And because Sundance was on, the slopes felt empty. “It’s the best time to ski,” one local winked. On my last day, after a storm, I had my first taste of Utah’s legendary powder, dropping into a steep bowl and gliding through the trees in mesmeric silence. It felt like flying. I saw great films too, from weird to genuinely moving. I flipped from a bizarre number about a woman falling way too in love with a wolf to a documentary about competitive endurance tickling. One minute I was wiping my eyes at the incredibly powerful Jim: The James Foley Story, and immediately afterwards I was trying to keep my dinner down at a   midnight screening of Antibirth. It was like falling down a   of kaleidoscopic sensations. That’s what makes Sundance special  —   it’s a pic’n’mix for the eyes. Screenings were packed, people cheered, and directors spoke. It was about as raucous as going to the movies gets, but not pretentious. Before I arrived I thought the town might become Hollywood, but I was pleased to see Hollywood become the town. It’s also beautiful: a   main street on the mountain’s edge, lit with fairy lights and packed with bars, restaurants and galleries. But, during Sundance, you need to plan ahead. Everything sells out, accommodation is at a premium and cinema tickets packages are   expensive and must be booked well in advance or it’s fastest finger first (the real Sundance wouldn’t have had a problem with this) on the festival app waiting list. There’s also a tangible difference between the   first half of the festival and the   second. In the end, it was the New Frontiers programming, celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, that really caught my eye. There were more than 30 VR experiences on display, from seeing the forest through the eyes of insects and owls to living with sea gypsies and Maasai warriors. I watched my body transform into a dark angel and flapped my arms to fly away, I travelled from the blue icebergs of Iceland to a motorbike shop in Japan and then, in the Guardian’s own project, I spent six agonising minutes in a solitary confinement cell. These were more than just films, I realised these were tools for creating genuine empathy. The more I saw, the more I felt on a cusp of a brave new world  —   like witnessing the switch from radio to TV. Why watch someone else’s story when you can be the star of your own? • The trip was provided by Visit Utah, Visit Park City and Deer Valley. Accommodation was provided by St Regis Deer Valley (doubles from $313). America As You Like It has a   holiday to Park City departing 19 January 2017, from £1, 842pp, including flights, transfers and accommodation at the St Regis Deer Valley but excluding festival tickets. Sundance 2017 runs from   January,   packages cost $ $600,   pass sold out, more expensive packages still available

Shunned by white America, how Muhammad Ali found his voice on campus tour
, Time had sanitized the past. Portraits of Muhammad Ali’s activism in the wake of his death at 74 on Friday paint a picture of a fighter who helped change American culture with his refusal to be drafted into the US military but cannot explain how dire his situation actually was in 1967. Much of America hated and feared him. He was facing five years in prison for saying no to the military. He was through as a fighter, stripped of his license by the New York State Athletic Board and facing a long court fight to overturn his conviction. “Everyone turned on him,” fellow boxer George Foreman told CNN on Saturday. “I mean literally everyone. I hadn’t even gone into boxing yet. No one wanted to be in his presence. No one wanted to be his friend and he was dropped. ” This was one of the toughest parts of Ali’s life. As his backers in the Nation of Islam pushed him further into activism, much of white American shunned him. His passport had been taken away. He complained, at one point that: “I’m not allowed to work in America and I’m not allowed to leave America. ” And yet the   period  —   at the height of his sporting powers, from when he refused to step forward as draft officials in Houston called his name to 1971 when the supreme court overturned his conviction and   sentence  —   helped shape the Ali who would later become beloved. It became the time that he grew into his voice.  Ali embarked on a series of college tours across America delivering lengthy soliloquies on his faith, his decision to conscientiously object to the war in Vietnam, and his experiences of racism in America. At first the speeches were stunted, narrowly repeating Nation of Islam dictums. But quickly Ali began to thrive, sparring with students who challenged his views and delivering characteristically pithy retorts. In one adversarial speech, just months after the assassination of Dr Martin Luther King Jr in April 1968, Ali told a packed auditorium at Union College in Schenectady, New York: “We don’t hate white people  —   we know them too well. ” Adding: “And the only solution to today’s racial problems is separation. ” According to college newspaper reports the entire address was received with cheers, applause and laughter. Ali, dressed in a   silk suit, continued: “Even Tarzan, king of the African jungle, is a white man swinging around each week with diapers on. ”  Bill Siegel, director of the documentary The Trials of Muhammad Ali, argued these years not only helped Ali forge his dissident voice, but showed him he was part of a broader, younger, grassroots   movement. “It forced him to become even more himself and develop himself as an independent thinker, and also to recognise that he had allies that he didn’t know he had, meaning white college students, who were coming around to where he was,” Siegel said in an interview. But the tours were also born out of financial necessity. Ali, then in his   and a young father, could no longer make a living from boxing following his criminal conviction. Ali ended his address to students at Union college with a short rhyme: “I like your school and admire your style, but your pay is so small, I won’t be back for a while. ” “It’s one thing to be a marcher at a symbolic rally,” civil rights leader Jesse Jackson told CNN on Saturday, “[But] he lost of all of his wealth, he almost became a pauper, [going] school to school giving speeches because he’d gave it all up for his principles. That made him a very different guy. ” Former Washington Post and Atlanta Journal Constitution columnist Dave Kindred, who knew Ali well and wrote a book about the fighter’s relationship with broadcaster Howard Cosell called Sound and Fury, believes Ali enjoyed the college tours. “I think he was surprised at finding an audience that he never really knew existed,” Kindred said. To Kindred the hardest thing about that time for Ali was that he could not fight between the ages of 24 and 29, which are the peak years for most athletes. As successful as his boxing career was, he might have had even greater success in the ring had his license not been taken away. “I don’t think he suffered much in other ways,” Kindred says. “Money didn’t matter to him at all. He wanted money just to get by. The Nation of Islam was supporting him as best as they could. ” Ali feared the Nation and their leader Elijah Muhammad. After Ali’s friend and adviser Malcolm X was banished from the Nation by Muhammad and later assassinated, Ali worried the same thing could happen to him. He once told Kindred he didn’t want the Nation to kill him, too. “Ali was not a leader, he was a follower,” Kindred says. “Ali wanted to be guided  —   as independent and eccentric as he wanted to be. He attached himself to leaders. All the racist harangues, the “white man is the devil”  —   that was the Nation’s ideology and he became its most vocal mouthpiece. He was coached by the Nation. ” But Ali’s words were heard. The more he spoke them on college campuses and the more they reached new ears, the bolder he became. “He loved the sound of his voice,” Kindred said. “His voice at that time was getting a lot of attention. ” After the   heavyweight champion retired in 1981 that voice grew silent, however. Aside from the occasional commercial or interview he did not appear much as his body started to feel the effects of Parkinson’s disease, which slowly took away his ability to move and speak. He was no longer the raging presence in the ring or on college campuses. He was just gone,   before the world as the surprise   at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. “I don’t think there was any relationship with America,” Kindred said. “Then when he reappears frail and trembling and vulnerable he was embraced. It was kind of a guilt. Look at what he gave for us as a fighter. ”

Trump recruits ’election observers’ as he warns of potential voter fraud
Donald Trump’s presidential campaign started recruiting “election observer” volunteers late Friday, after the Republican nominee claimed the only way he would lose Pennsylvania is “if cheating goes on” in “certain areas”.  The application form on the campaign website links directly to a page soliciting campaign donations with the text: “I AM YOUR VOICE. ” Trump repeated claims at a Friday night rally, without evidence, that he fears a “rigged” election perpetrated in part by voter fraud. No Republican candidate for president has won Pennsylvania since 1988, and in 2012 the state’s then Republican government, in court over a voter ID law, admitted in legal papers that its lawyers knew of no instances of   voter fraud in the state. The law was struck down in 2014. Despite this, Trump warned that Pennsylvania voters needed monitoring. “We’re gonna watch Pennsylvania,” he said on Friday. “Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times. The only way we can lose, in my opinion  —   and I really mean this, Pennsylvania  —   is if cheating goes on. I really believe it. “So I hope you people can sort of not just vote on the 8th  —   go around and look and watch other polling places and make sure that it’s 100% fine,” he added. Election observers are not unusual and are often relied on to field complaints and concerns from voters. Depending on state law, campaign representatives may be barred from the role. In Pennsylvania, only election officials, certified poll watchers or qualified voters with valid reasons can bring challenges on the grounds of identity or residence, according to the Advancement Project, a civil rights group. The state’s election code states that a voter “shall have the right to cast his or her vote: without the use or threat of force, violence or restraint without the infliction or threat of infliction of injury without any intimidation or coercion upon or against his or her person or without any other action intended to deny any individual’s right to vote. ” Trump’s initiative to enlist election observers may risk running afoul of a longstanding consent decree that bars the Republican National Committee from engaging in such activities, according to Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine. Writing on the Election Law Blog, Hasen noted that the ruling forbade the RNC from engaging in ballot security efforts, without prior court consent. The decree specifically orders RNC members “refrain from undertaking any ballot security activities in polling places or election districts where the racial or ethnic composition of such districts is a factor”.  In 2013, the US supreme court rejected an RNC request to lift a    court order that limits the national Republican party’s powers to challenge voters’ eligibility at the polls. The businessman’s campaign appeared to be aware of the legal risks of its initiative: signing up to join delivers an email to the registrant with a promise to “do everything we are legally allowed to do to stop crooked Hillary from rigging this election”. But Trump himself has increasingly spoken about the election in ways that would deligitimise its results, saying in Pennsylvania and Ohio that it might be “rigged”. This warnings have followed polls that show him trailing in key states, including Pennsylvania, where he has a   to   deficit, according to a Quinnipiac survey of likely voters published last week. Earlier this week, Trump specifically warned of voter identity fraud. “You don’t have to have voter ID to now go in and vote, and it’s a little bit scary,” he told Fox News. “I’ve heard a lot of bad things. I mean, people are going to walk in, they are going to vote 10 times, maybe. ” In 2014, a Loyola law school study found only 31 “credible allegations” of voter impersonation out of a billion ballots cast around the country in several elections. The businessman’s remarks about “certain areas” appears to be an allusion to the fact that in 2012 no one voted for Mitt Romney in 59 Philadelphia voting divisions. A Philadelphia Inquirer investigation corroborated the statistic, by knocking on doors when necessary, and found that it is not unprecedented: in almost exclusively African American neighborhoods like those in Philadelphia, John McCain had zero votes in 57 voting divisions, and whole precincts did not vote for him in Chicago and Atlanta. Barack Obama won 93% of the African American vote nationwide and in Pennsylvania in 2012. Earlier this month, Barack Obama responded to Trump’s fears of a “rigged” election, saying they suggested a lack of confidence. “Sometimes folks, if they lose, they start complaining that they got cheated,” Obama said. “But I’ve never heard of somebody complaining about being cheated before the game was over, or before the score is even tallied. So my suggestion would be go out there and try to win the election. ”

How the Indy 500 recovered from civil war to celebrate its 100th running
Of the estimated   who plan to flock to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway for the 100th running of the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday, no one will have a better vantage point for the green flag of the   race than James Hinchcliffe, a    Canadian. A year after he was nearly killed in an accident during a practice session at the Brickyard, Hinchcliffe earned pole position last weekend for the race, and he will lead the   field down the main straightaway at about 220mph into the first turn of the race. Hinchcliffe’s comeback would probably be the most compelling story any other year, but he understands that the event itself supersedes everything else in 2016. The Indy 500 has made it to 100. Two decades ago, that was not such a sure thing. “For us, it is the biggest race of our year, but it’s the biggest race in the world,” Hinchcliffe told the Guardian this week over breakfast in New York. “We’ve got the largest sports stadium on earth, and it’s sold out. It just speaks volumes for how much the race really means. And just to have a sporting event make it to 100 makes it a pretty big deal. The Super Bowl just celebrated 50. It’s pretty impressive we’re even here, and 100 years down the road, we’ve managed to make it a sellout crowd. ”   racing in the United States seems to have survived a civil war, started in 1996 when Tony George, then the president of the speedway, launched the Indy Racing League, a competitor to the established Championship Auto Racing Teams, Inc. George believed   racing in the US should be competed largely by American drivers on ovals like Indianapolis, rather than the twisty courses used in Formula One. The sport, George thought, had become too expensive. But the   Cart drivers stayed put. The Indy 500 was packed with IRL drivers  —   and a lot of them were from somewhere else. In five editions of the race between 1996 and 2000, US drivers won twice, and neither Buddy Lazier and Eddie Cheever Jr won the race again. (Lazier starts 32nd this year.) When the prolific team owner Roger Penske returned to Indianapolis in 2001 (and won the race with a flamboyant Brazilian, Helio Castroneves, who later won Dancing With the Stars) the fissure began to close. The IRL, known later as the IndyCar Series, and the remnants of the Cart series merged in 2008. But the Indy 500, and   racing in general, had been usurped by Nascar, which feature much slower stock cars but tighter racing. The 2010 edition was the   Indy 500 since ABC began carrying the race live in 1986. Even worse, 5. 8 million watched, compared with the 6. 5 million that watched Nascar’s   600 later the same day. To foster closer and safer competition, Indy cars were redesigned before the 2012 season. At about the same time, by coincidence, interest in Nascar races  —   for many people too many, too similar and too dull  —   began to decline. The Indy 500 saw a spike in TV ratings. The ratings dipped again the next year, but more people watched Juan Pablo Montoya win the 2015 Indy 500 than watched Carl Edwards win the   Coke 600. It was the first time in 10 years that the Indy 500, run in the daytime, outdrew the Coke 600, run in primetime. “There used to be races where there were five cars on the lead lap early in the race,” Hinchcliffe said. “It was cool, and people still enjoyed it, but it’s a very different dynamic now. I think the audience is different now, in general. Everything’s got to be a little  . Everybody’s attention spans are shortening. If there’s only five guys up there on the lead lap, people are on Twitter, they’re not paying attention anymore. The fact that we’ve got a car that can race the way it can, to put on that kind of show, for 500 miles, is really good. ” Track officials announced Wednesday that all   reserved seats for the 100th Indy 500 had been sold, and, as a result, the race would be carried live on TV in the Indianapolis area for the first time since 1950.  “This one is going to take care of itself,” driver Marco Andretti, Mario Andretti’s grandson, told the Guardian. “We’ve got to keep it going as a big thing, to the 101st and the 102nd. Hopefully, we can steamroll this thing off the momentum. Hopefully, the people who come will really enjoy it, and we put on a good show, and it snowballs. Now’s a better time than any. ” Andretti, who will start 14th, said, “Our product is really good. You look at the teams and the drivers, from top to bottom, it’s the most competitive series in the world. It’s way more competitive than Formula One, where you have one guy racing three guys, maybe. ” Andretti believes as many as 15 drivers have a good shot at winning. Ryan   who won the race in 2014 and will start third in the field, said there are 20 drivers with a realistic shot  —   although the hot weather expected for Sunday will result in less desirable driving conditions. Twenty years later, it is hard to determine what the civil war really accomplished. The 1995 Indy 500, won by the    Canadian Jacques Villeneuve (who went on to win the F1 world championship in 1997) included 14 Americans and 19 foreigners. The starting lineup for this year’s race will include 13 Americans and 15 foreigners. George, the grandson of Tony Hulman, who resuscitated the dormant Brickyard after buying it at the end of the second world war, was deposed in 2009 from running Hulman  Company businesses, which include the speedway. He brought in the US Grand Prix, only to see a   disaster when all but six cars in 2005 pulled out immediately before the race with tire concerns. George has pretty much disappeared from the speedway. He is the silent   of Ed Carpenter Racing, run by his stepson, Ed Carpenter, who will start 20th Sunday. (Another Ed Carpenter Racing driver, Josef Newgarden, will start second, next to Hinchcliffe.) More has been loaded into the Indy 500 schedule than just racing events. Besides moving IndyCar races to television slots with fewer conflicts with Nascar, Mark Miles, who became the CEO of Hulman  Company in 2012, has added a   concert this year for younger   fans in the Snake Pit. “You don’t go to an NFL game and not walk through the tailgates and everything  —   it’s got to be an experience,” Miles said in February. “I just think we have more opportunity to do it because we’re vast physically. We’ve got a lot more time when we get our hands on people, and we need to be younger. ” But close racing, at higher speeds with much less of a margin for error than stock cars, will continue to sell the sport. There were 37 lead changes in last year’s Indy 500, second only to an astonishing 68 lead changes in the 2013 race. Because of aerodynamic packages, the days of a driver pulling out to a big lead and cruising to victory are long past. “We have all these people who come to their first Indycar race and are just blown away,” Hinchcliffe said. “I’ve never met someone who has shown up at a track and has left unhappy, or didn’t leave a lifelong fan. The series has been seeing this upward trend, and we will have what will be the biggest race in history, in any kind of motorsport ever, and all these people are going to see it. “We’ve had such a good   product for so many years, but we were in kind of a lull, and not many people knew about it. Now we have this tremendous opportunity, in front of the entire world, in front of a   people on site and tens of millions on TV globally, who are going to see it. What I hope is that you see a lot of people coming back to the race, people who grew up with it, went to the race with their parents, say, ‘Oh, it’s the 100th. I’ll come back.’ “In a lot of ways, Indycar racing sells itself, because the product is so entertaining. The experience of being at an auto race is so visceral. It’s such an experience for the fan. I just think the experience of coming to the track for the first time is going to do tremendous things for us. ”

Wisconsin governor activates national guard after night of protests in Milwaukee
Milwaukee’s police chief identified the man whose killing by an officer prompted protests, clashes with police and arson on Saturday night, as the state’s governor activated the national guard for fear of more unrest. On Sunday afternoon police chief Edward Flynn identified the shooting victim as Sylville K Smith, and said he had a “lengthy arrest record” before he fled from a traffic stop, with a gun, and was shot dead by an officer. Hours after Smith’s shooting scores of protesters clashed with police, set fire to buildings and threw rocks and bricks at officers. On Sunday, Wisconsin governor Scott Walker activated the national guard to assist if necessary, on the request of Milwaukee County sheriff David Clarke Jr. At about 11pm, police reported responding to shots fired, at Sherman and Burleigh. They said on Twitter they used an armoured vehicle to retrieve and take the injured person, whose identity is unclear, to hospital.  Mayor Tom Barrett said on Sunday that four officers were injured in the confrontations, including one by a brick hurled into a squad car, but that they had all been treated and released from the hospital. Barrett said that the officer who shot Smith was wearing a body camera at the time, and that video and photographic evidence showed “without question” that he had a gun in hand at the time. Flynn did not name the officer but said that both people involved in the shooting were black. Skirmishes between protesters and police continued on the city’s north side until after midnight, when the mayor pleaded for calm in a televised news conference. “We have to have calm,” he said. “There are a lot of really good people who live in this neighborhood. ”  A fire burned for hours at a gas station in Sherman Park, with firefighters unable to approach because of gunshots in the area. They also extinguished blazes in a police cruiser, a bank branch, car parts store and beauty supply store. Police arrested three people by the night’s end, Barrett said. The protests began after Smith, 23, shot dead when he fled from a traffic stop. Police said he was armed with a semiautomatic weapon, but they did not describe details of the shooting, except to say he was hit by bullets twice, in the chest and arm. State officials will investigate the shooting, and the officer involved has been placed on administrative leave, both standard practices. The officer has not been identified, though police said the officer had been with the department for six years, three of which as an officer. The handgun was traced to a burglary in nearby Waukesha in March, according to police, had been stopped for what Barrett called “suspicious activity”.  “There were 23 rounds in that gun that that officer was staring at,” Barrett said. “I want to make sure we don’t lose any police officers in this community either. ” Another police official, Bill Jessup, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that it was not clear if the suspect pointed the gun or fired at the officers. “This is a warning cry,” Milwaukee alderman Khalif Rainey told reporters. “What has happened may not have been right,” he added. “I’m not justifying that, but nobody can deny that there are racial problems here in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, that have to be rectified, because if you don’t, you’re one day away. ” “Black people in Milwaukee are tired,” he said. “They are tired of living under this oppression. ” Tensions have intensified between local black residents and police in recent weeks, in parallel with national anxieties about police abuses and violence targeted toward officers. In July the city saw protests over the shooting    Jay Andreson, who was shot dead in a suburb west of Milwaukee, the 2015 shooting of    Tony Robinson, and the 2014 killing of    Dontre Hamilton, an unarmed man with a history of mental health problems. The white officer who killed Hamilton was subsequently fired from the department but did not face criminal charges, a decision that prompted protests, a series of reform measures and the introduction of body cameras. In December the Justice Department and Milwaukee police department began a joint “collaborative reform initiative” and a federal assessment is expected this fall. The project was announced after the Justice Department declined to open a civil rights investigation into Hamilton’s killing. “This entire community has sat back and witnessed how Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has become the worst place to live for African Americans in the entire country,” Rainey said. “Where do we go from here? Where do we go as a community from here, Milwaukee’s Sherman Park neighborhood has one of the city’s higher crime rates, and has been the focus of sustained police harassment that intensified in recent weeks, according to local activists.  Stephanie Roades, a local organizer with the Showing Up for Racial Justice network, said some residents had recently started operating patrol shifts to monitor interactions between locals and police officers.  The BP gas station burned by protesters on Saturday has itself been the scene of a number of recent confrontations. In July, a station worker opened fire on a large group of juveniles he claimed were harassing him. The event prompted outrage among some community members who called for a boycott of the local business and protested outside.  Local activists told the Guardian it was likely the gas station was deliberately targeted. The owner of a gas station, Pakhar Singh, blamed outsiders for the violence that destroyed his business, and said he’s owned stations in the area for 36 years and has never had trouble. He was not sure sure whether to rebuild. Milwaukee is America’s most racially segregated major city, according to research by the Brookings Institute, and although 40% of the city’s residents are African American, only 17% of Milwaukee police officers are black.  “Our city is in turmoil tonight,” said Ashanti Hamilton, president of the Milwaukee common council, alluding to violence that had wracked the city in the last 24 hours. Clarke, a political ally of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, has been an outspoken critic of the Black Lives Matter movement. The African American sheriff has described the nebulous protest movement as “the enemy” and listed it alongside Isis as a national security threat in a recently penned article.  Five people were killed in nine shootings over nine hours across the city on Friday and Saturday, including a    and    who were fatally wounded outside a bar. “As everyone knows, this was a very, very violent 24 hours in the city of Milwaukee,” Jessup said. “Our officers are out here taking risks on behalf of the community and making   decisions. ”

Laura Jane Grace: ’Punk was more closed-minded than the church’
For the title of her new memoir, transgender rock star Laura Jane Grace borrowed a word she hates: Tranny. “It’s not a word I want to identify with,” she said. “But so much of my experience has been about internalized transphobia. I still have transphobic thoughts against myself. That’s the inevitable result of living in the world I live in. ” The lacerating effects of those thoughts tear through nearly every page of Tranny, a book which takes as its subtitle Confessions of Punk Rock’s Most Infamous Anarchist  . That cheeky phrase reflects the often misunderstood politics of Grace’s successful band, Against Me! an outfit she formed as a teenage outcast while living in the benighted suburbs of Gainesville, Florida in the late 90s. While Grace, now 35, came out as a trans person in Rolling Stone in 2012, only in the memoir does she reveal the complexity, and the unresolved ache, of her quest for  . That’s communicated most poignantly by the inclusion of pages ripped from the diaries Grace has kept for years. “I am completely lost,” begins a typical missive from 2004. “What voice do I listen to? What urge do I follow? I can never be anything more than a pervert dressed up in women’s clothes. ” Grace says one motivation for writing the book was to unburden herself of the literal weight of her voluminous journals. “I wanted to do something with them so I no longer had to lug them everywhere I went,” she says with a laugh. The book traces Grace’s gender issues back to age five when she identified with Madonna’s Material Girl video when she saw it on TV . “Every kid has that moment when you look to your elders to try and see who you could be when you grow up,” Grace said. “It was watching Madonna when the gender dysphoria hit me. My sense of   didn’t align with what other people expected from me. ” After all, she had been raised as Tom Grace in a military family, a situation which led to confusion, depression and shame. “That was compounded by the fact there was just no information,” Grace said. “I didn’t know the word transgender and I had no internet to search or book to read. ” As a teenager, Grace sought escape in the fog of drink and the creativity of punk. She loved the purity and conviction of the punk scene. “It meant so much to me that someone would mean what they said,” Grace recalled. “It was about wanting something to be real. ” Grace formed her band at age 15 with drummer and friend Kevin Mahon. In Tranny, she writes about exploring the possibility of sex with Mahon, without resolution. “I was recognizing that maybe he had a thing for me  —   which made me realize that maybe I might have a thing for him too,” the singer said. “I wasn’t able to understand any of it. I had no understanding of sexuality or gender. ” Besides, the possibility of a gay identity didn’t fit into the punk world that Grace knew. “Punk was supposed to be so open and accepting,” she said. “But when it came down to it, it was still hard to be queer in any way and not face judgment for it. ” When Against Me! began to get popular and attract major label attention, they fell afoul of punk’s suspicions about success. In the memoir, Grace paints punks as even more rigid in their thinking about music than many people are in their approach to gender. “I turned to the punk scene because I thought it would be a more   place,” she said. “But I found that it was more   than the church. ” Grace began to defy the rules of punk as fervently as she did the codes of masculine identity. In her band’s lyrics she started to write lines that expressed her feelings of gender dysmorphia. “At first, I attributed it to my subconscious pushing me forward,” Grace said. The lyrics sailed right over the heads of both the fans and her  . “It became this game of ‘OK, how much can I get say and get away with it? ’” Grace said. “When I was still getting no reaction it became disheartening. I was [like] ‘OK, are you listening to any of the lyrics? ’”  At the same time, she began to test the waters of presentation by increasingly dressing in women’s clothing, though always in secret. The fear of discovery highlighted Grace’s sense of shame. In the meantime, she pursued the most conventional personal life possible, maintaining deep romantic relationships with women and, later, marrying and having a child. The seriousness of her commitments greatly intensified Grace’s feelings of entrapment. Her book relates, in harrowing detail, the fear leading up to finally coming clean to her family and to her fans. But her turmoil became even more intense after those disclosures, once she realized that little of the serious, internal work of   had begun. Once she got the book deal in 2012, she sank to a new low. “I thought, ‘Oh my God. I’ve got to write a fucking book and they expect it to be some “Becoming Laura” story in which transition solves all my problems’,” Grace said. “I didn’t know what to do. ”  She also felt pressure to act as a role model for the transgender community at a point when doubts still crowded her own mind. “People would come up to me and casually say, ‘Hey, you inspired me to start hormones.’ I don’t want to discredit someone’s   ability but at the same time I don’t want to be responsible if they have a negative experience. Hormones are a really big thing. They can do crazy things with your head. And anyway, your identity shouldn’t be based on whether or not you’re doing hormones. ”  For Grace, the more profound transition has to do with “smashing the male ego. If you’ve been raised and socialized, as a male, and you’re transitioning to living your life openly as female, then you have to destroy the male ego you’ve been raised with. For me, coming out to my friends and family wasn’t enough to fully destroy it. It was everything that happened internally afterwards that did. ”  Grace said that’s why it took her four years to write the book. She needed that time to more fully become herself. Meanwhile, the world of began to change around her. “There have been so many milestones that I never thought would happen,” Grace said. “You have a trans person like Laverne Cox on the cover of Time magazine!”  Still, she doubts these media representations translate to everyday issues for trans people, such as being able to walk down a street safely, be treated fairly in the workplace or have adequate healthcare. A recent experience demonstrated the disconnect. While on tour, Grace was walking through the Detroit airport when she saw a giant TV broadcasting comments from attorney general Loretta Lynch about transgender rights. The sight made her swell with pride. Yet, minutes later, at the airport bar, Grace heard the staff spewing ignorant comments. “I went down to them and said ‘I’m transgender and you’re wrong about this’,” she said. “The first thing out of someone’s mouth was, ‘Is it true that Caitlyn Jenner resents changing from Bruce?’ What do you say to that?”  Issues also remain in the artist’s personal life. Her wife left her after she came clean about her identity and for a while, they didn’t speak. After reading the memoir, her former partner called Grace a narcissist. “Fair enough,” Grace allows. ‘There is something inherently narcissistic about writing a memoir at 35. ”  There’s also something unfinished about it. Grace realizes she has a lot more of life to navigate. In the meantime, some very positive things have happened for her, including a new sense of camaraderie with her band and a growing base of supportive fans. Still, such things can’t instantly erase the traumas of the past. “It’s impossible not to be somewhat fucked up after spending 30 years dealing with dysphoria and then being out for five years,” she said. “That’s a lot of baggage and mental issues to work through. It’s not like because you accept a certain part of yourself that, all of a sudden, you’re solved as a person. It’s just a good first step. ”

Why I stand in solidarity with the Dakota pipeline protesters
I’ve been drawn to the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation since shortly after they started. While mainstream press coverage of the protests has been relatively scarce, I’ve read whatever articles, watched whatever videos and followed whatever Twitter handle I could find in order to keep updated on the events unfolding in North Dakota, as Native peoples from around the country gather, yet again, to protect the land and water that they love. While my work is most often focused on   racism and its intersections with sexism, I feel a deep solidarity with these   protests. I feel it in my bones. I have a need to amplify news about them whenever I can, to encourage support whenever I can, to donate what I can. I have looked at flight costs over and over again, trying to decide if I should go there and literally stand in solidarity, or if it would be better for me to use those resources to help a Native person, who may not otherwise be able to, stand there instead.  As I scan articles for mention of other black Americans who feel the same solidarity with these protests, I’m happy to find an increasing number. I want us all there, standing with our Native brothers and sisters. Our struggle is different and yet in so many ways the same.  I stand with Standing Rock, because we, like you, have had our babies stolen from our arms and our language and history stolen from our mouths. We, like you, have seen our culture turned into costume and our art turned into advertising.  We have all have seen our blood drench this soil in the name of white supremacy, our infant mortality rates climb in a system that aims to keep us in poverty and ill health. We, like you, have seen our men and women die in the streets at the hands of murderous cops. We see your water threatened today by the same carelessness and corruption that has ruined our water and threatened our health in Flint. And we see people look at you today and say, like they say to us: that the poverty and the incarceration and the illness and the crime  —   it’s all your fault. But we also see you fighting every day for your land and your history and your families and your future, just like we fight for ours. And as we march demanding that this white supremacist nation finally recognize that Black Lives Matter, you use your bodies as shields, demanding that your right for clean drinking water and for the autonomy of your land be respected.  You inspire many of us. And I know that we cannot topple a system of white supremacy if we are not willing to fight alongside any and all of those who are imprisoned by it. Your fight to preserve the land that we all stand on benefits us all. Your fight to preserve your autonomy benefits us all. And I thank you, and I hope that you know that when we march to end police brutality and the prison industrial complex we do so that your brothers and sisters will be safer too.  And so I pledge my solidarity to you, the Lakota, Lummi, Puyallup, Swinomish, Crow, Oglala, Navajo, Seneca and over 200 other nations who have gathered together to fight for your water and your land. I know that I am not alone in this pledge, and I am confident that many more of my black brothers and sisters will join me in saying that whatever you need, however you need us, we’ll be there. Water is life.

How would the Stoics cope today?
Some of us are stressed. Others are overworked, struggling with the new responsibilities of parenthood, or moving from one flawed relationship to another. Whatever it is, whatever you are going through, there is wisdom from the Stoics that can help. Followers of this ancient and inscrutable philosophy have found themselves at the centre of some of history’s most trying ordeals, from the French Revolution to the American Civil War to the prison camps of Vietnam. Bill Clinton reportedly reads Roman Emperor and stoic Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations once a year, and one can imagine him handing a copy to Hillary after her   loss in the US presidential election. Stoicism is a school of philosophy which was founded in Athens in the early 3rd century and then progressed to Rome, where it became a pragmatic way of addressing life’s problems. The central message is, we don’t control what happens to us we control how we respond. The Stoics were really writing and thinking about one thing: how to live. The questions they asked were not arcane or academic but practical and real. “What do I do about my anger?” “What do I do if someone insults me?” “I’m afraid to die why is that?” “How can I deal with the difficult situations I face?” “How can I deal with the success or power I hold?” There also happens to be a decent amount of advice on how to live under the looming threat of a tyrant (“I may wish to be free from torture, but if the time comes for me to endure it, I’ll wish to bear it courageously with bravery and honour,” wrote the Roman philosopher Seneca). All of which makes Stoic philosophy particularly   to the world we live in. While it would be hard to find a word dealt a greater injustice at the hands of the English language than “stoicism” —   with its mistaken connotations of austerity and lack of emotion  —   in fact, nothing could be more necessary for our times than a good dose of Stoic philosophy. When the news media provokes us with overwhelming amounts of information, Epictetus, another Roman philosopher, cuts through the noise: “If you wish to improve, be content to appear clueless or stupid in extraneous matters. ” When it feels like people are ruder and more selfish than ever, Marcus Aurelius urges us to ask when we ourselves have behaved the same way  —   and says that the best revenge is simply “to not be like that”. When the natural inclination is to focus on achievement and money, Seneca’s reminder to his    who had just been removed from a prominent position, rings true: “Believe me, it’s better to produce the balance sheet of your own life than that of the grain market. ” In their writings  —   often private letters or diaries  —   and in their lectures, the Stoics struggled to come up with real, actionable answers. They held duty and honour as sacred obligations and they believed that every obstacle they faced was simply an opportunity  —   to test themselves and be better. Now Stoicism is finding resonance with new followers. Just last month in New York, a conference called Stoicon was declared to be the largest gathering of Stoics in history. This kind of philosophy is not an idle pursuit but a crucial tool. As Seneca said, “Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are my own. ”  Ryan Holiday is the author of The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living (Profile Books, £9. 99).

DRC opposition calls for more protests despite recent deaths
Opposition leaders in the Democratic Republic of the Congo say they plan further street protests to pressure President Joseph Kabila to call elections, despite the deaths of dozens of demonstrators earlier this week. The call for an intensified street campaign will concern the international community, which has watched the continued turmoil in the vast central African state with increasing alarm.  About 40 demonstrators, as well as at least six police officers, were killed in clashes with security forces in Kinshasa, the capital, on Monday and Tuesday. Buildings, including the offices of major opposition parties, were badly damaged amid widespread looting.  “We will keep up the pressure   …     and announce more street actions and more demonstrations until Mr Kabila is removed from office,” Martin Fayulu, a parliamentarian and leader of an opposition party, told the Guardian. “[Taking to] the street is a right of popular expression in the face of a power that cannot be heard or seen,” said Ève Bazaïba, another major opposition politician.  The DRC has suffered repeated bouts of unrest since Kabila, 45, announced that elections scheduled for later this year would be delayed.  Opponents say Kabila, whose second term in office expires in December, is trying to cling to power, either by delaying elections or revising the constitution. His supporters say logistical and financial constraints mean it is impossible to hold fair polls as planned. Analysts say this week’s violence marked a turning point. “Until now all the focus was on political dialogue. Now it is shifting from the corridors of power to the street. Kabila thinks he may be able to tough it out. The opposition thinks it might provoke a crisis,” said Jason Stearns, director of the Congo Research Group at New York University.  Kabila took over as leader of the DRC less than two weeks after his father, Laurent, was shot by a bodyguard in the presidential palace in 2001. He was elected president in disputed polls in 2006 and again in 2011. The DRC’s constitution bars a third term.  Analysts say Kabila appears to have adopted a strategy of “glissement” or indefinite delay.  Western states, including the US, have repeatedly told Kabila to stick to the election calendar. Several  —   most notably the US  —   are now considering targeted sanctions against key senior individuals within his inner circle. However the opposition is fragmented, with some major figures overseas and others joining talks with the president’s representatives. Juvénal Munubo, a parliamentarian with the opposition Union Pour La Nation Congolaise said that the coming weeks would see a surge in violence if Kabila did not clarify his position on leaving power and move to reduce tensions with political opponents by releasing political prisoners or dropping law cases against dissidents. Munubo called for a new date for the election to be fixed for next year as soon as possible. “The negotiations are the best way forward but must be inclusive and conclude rapidly,” he said. The office of Kabila, who has been abroad during the unrest attending the United Nations general assembly in New York, issued its first statement on Wednesday condemning the violence and offering its condolences to victims’ families. Kabila “invites the entire population to go about their daily activities now that security is again fully ensured,” it said on   television. Human rights groups say they have catalogued a wave of detentions, disappearances and attacks on opponents of the government. Government officials have denied the allegations. “The DRC looks forward to working with the international community, civil society and opposition parties to advance democracy and rule of law,” said Barnabé Kikaya bin Karubi, chief diplomatic adviser to Kabila. One point of contention is the timing of different sets of elections. Another is the revision of the electoral roll. Kabila loyalists say problems with the electoral roll make it impossible to hold a fair poll this year. The current version is thought to exclude about half of the DRC’s 45 million potential voters, including about 7 million new voters who have come of age since 2011. Independent experts have said a complete revision could take   months. Whereas neighbouring strongmen Denis Sassou Nguesso in   and Paul Kagame in Rwanda easily pushed through constitutional changes to allow them to stand for third terms, Kabila has been unable to take such a blunt approach. Kabila did manage to outmanoeuvre Moïse Katumbi, a tycoon who was seen as a powerful challenger. Katumbi, who had built a support base in Katanga province, was forced to leave the country earlier this year to seek medical treatment. Katumbi is currently in Washington, from where he issued a call for sanctions this week. “Without sanctions, they will continue killing people like mosquitoes,” Katumbi said. Congo has found itself the focus of a range of foreign actors in recent weeks. These include the governments of France and the former colonial power, Belgium. An Italian MEP of Congolese origin took to YouTube last week, saying she was “proud to see the Congolese people rise up for their rights”. However the attitude of the US is key, and both Katumbi and Kabila have engaged lobbyists in Washington, recognising that winning the battle for policymakers’ opinion there may be the way to win the struggle for power. The frustration of US officials with Kabila is increasingly evident. Bin Karubi, the president’s adviser, described his recent trip to Washington as a “pleading mission” to avert sanctions. Bilateral aid cuts are also possible  —   though most assistance is humanitarian and thus difficult to reduce without hurting ordinary people. Though GDP growth in Congo is estimated at around 5% per annum, there are deep economic problems and entrenched poverty. Some observers argue that both the government and opposition parties no longer reflect popular frustration at harsh living conditions.  “The political elite is arguing over power. The opposition are trying to gather the popular frustration to their side to oust Kabila but people are getting quite frustrating with a strategy which has made it very hard for them to provide for their families,” said Hans Hoebeke, a Congo analyst with the International Crisis Group. Damas, 35, is a qualified electrician but drives a taxi. His neighbourhood, Kinsuka, in south Kinshasa, saw significant violence last week. “Really there is too much suffering here, in Congo. Even if you work, the ends of the month are tough . .. Here there is no middle class. You are either very rich or very poor. If you have any chance to get out somehow, you’ve got to seize it,” he said. Almost all observers predict more unrest.  “There will be further protests in the street, the question is: where will they lead? Are they just going to lead to turmoil that is manageable for Kabila? Or call into question the economic and political stability of the country? We are talking about months, possibly years, of instability, and that could take us anywhere,” Stearns said.

Mind-controlled robot arm gives back sense of touch to paralysed man
A paralysed man has become the first to have a “natural” sense of touch restored, using a   robotic arm. Nathan Copeland, a   old American, lost all sensation from the chest downwards ten years ago when he was driving on a rainy night and his car skidded off course. Last year he became the first paralysis patient to test a   robotic hand, which he controlled using just his brain and that also allowed him to “feel” when the hand was being touched. The hand, developed by US scientists, was surgically wired directly to Copeland’s brain, providing him with a   electrical feedback. Despite the signals coming from a robotic hand, Copeland said the sensation of having his fingers touched was “almost natural”. “I can feel just about every finger, it’s a really weird sensation,” said Copeland. “Sometimes it feels electrical and sometimes its pressure, but for the most part, I can tell most of the fingers with definite precision. It feels like my fingers are getting touched or pushed. ” Robert Gaunt, assistant professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the University of Pittsburgh and the study’s senior author, said: “Really this is the first time this has been done in a person. There was always this question, will it work? Will it work in a person who has had an injury for a long time?” Previously the same team had allowed paralysis patients to control a prosthetic arm using thought alone, but the addition of sense of touch is seen as crucial. “We know that without sensation, movement is really challenging,” said Gaunt. “What we’ve added now is the ability to feel something through those fingers. .. We’re feeding back touch that the artificial hand encounters when it makes contact with an object. ” In the trial, Copeland wore a neural implant for six months during which time he trained himself how to control the movement of the robotic arm. The scientists were able to evoke sensory feedback from the arm by electrically stimulating the precise brain areas that would normally light up when different areas of the hand are touched in a healthy person. When blindfolded, Copeland could tell which of the fingers on the prosthetic were being touched with 84% accuracy and he described 93% of the touch sensations he was given, such as pressing a cotton swab on the surface of the skin, as feeling “possibly natural. ” Until now, it was not clear how natural the sensations delivered by this kind of prosthesis would feel. “The most important result in this study is that microstimulation of sensory cortex can elicit natural sensation instead of tingling,” said Andrew Schwartz, professor of neurobiology at University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, and a  .  The advance could transform the lives of amputees and victims of spinal cord injuries, but also raises the possibility of more distant future applications, including human enhancement. Copeland was in his first year of college doing a degree in nanofabrication when he had his accident, which left him unable to feel or move his lower arms and legs, and needing assistance with all his daily activities. “In 2004, I wrecked my car and I broke my neck,” he said. “I was 18. It was raining and I had taken a turn too fast. I never really liked driving to begin with. ” He tried to continue his studies, but health problems forced him to put his degree on hold and he kept busy by going to concerts and volunteering for the Pittsburgh Japanese Culture Society, which holds conventions on Japanese cartoons.  After being selected for the trial, Copeland had surgery, during which four tiny microelectrodes   each about half the size of a shirt button   were implanted into his brain. Prior to the surgery, imaging techniques were used to identify the exact regions in his brain corresponding to feelings in each of his fingers and his palm. The electrodes read out electrical activity from one region   the motor area   to control the movement of the hand and electrically stimulated another region linked to sensation to induce a sense of touch. “The ultimate goal is to create a system which moves and feels just like a natural arm would,” said Gaunt. “We have a long way to go to get there, but this is a great start. ” The team released preliminary findings last year. The full description of the trial was published on Thursday in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

9/11 report’s classified ’28 pages’ about potential Saudi Arabia ties released
The Obama administration has released the   28 pages of the official congressional report on the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, which concerned the alleged ties of the Saudi Arabian government to the   hijackers. Publishing the   pages 13 years after they were first classified, the White House insisted they show no link between Saudi Arabia and the hijackers who carried out the terrorist attacks. The pages put into the public domain the remaining unseen section of the 2002 report, from the joint congressional inquiry into intelligence community activities before and after the   attacks. “This information does not change the assessment of the US government that there’s no evidence that the Saudi government or senior Saudi individuals funded ” said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. “The number one takeaway from this should be that this administration is committed to transparency even when it comes to sensitive information related to national security. ” The publication, awaited for 13 years, will not necessarily end speculation around Saudi influence, however.  The 28 pages show that, according to FBI documents, several numbers found in the phone book of Abu Zubaydah, a senior   operative captured in Pakistan in March 2002 who is still being detained at Guantánamo Bay, could be linked, at least indirectly, to phone numbers in the US. Among them was a number “subscribed to” by a company in Aspen, Colorado, that managed the residence of the then Saudi ambassador, Bandar bin Sultan. In addition, according to an FBI document, the phone number of a bodyguard at the Saudi embassy in Washington, “who some have alleged may be a”  —   several words have been redacted  —   “was also found in Abu Zubaida’s (sic) possession”. Zubaydah became the test case for the CIA’s    torture program. Waterboarded more than 83 times in one month at a CIA black site in Thailand, Zubaydah was ultimately determined by CIA interrogators not to have yielded reliable intelligence from his abuse. A recently declassified document from CIA medical personnel judged that he “probably reached the point of cooperation” before his torture, even though CIA interrogators, according to the Senate’s 2014 investigation, convinced themselves Zubaydah had actionable and specific intelligence on imminent   plots.  Since 2006, Zubaydah has resided in a classified section of the Guantánamo Bay wartime prison complex. The US has never charged him with any offense a 2009 justice department filing contesting his habeas corpus petition walked back the government’s frequent claim that Zubaydah was a senior member of   calling him merely an “affiliate”. The newly declassified section of the congressional inquiry does not draw conclusions about Bandar, let alone accusations of complicity in   despite listing known or suspected associations to people once believed to have aided the terrorist attack. At several points its source material, largely derived from the FBI, states that it has closed inquiries or held them in “abeyance” as with the Aspcol connection.  Yet some of the sections of the declassified pages remain withheld. One such section concerns a Saudi navy officer who in March 2000 was in telephonic contact with two of the hijackers. It is unclear if the FBI ultimately found anything relevant on the officer, but the FBI currently does not consider the Saudi Arabian government complicit in the attack. Former president George W Bush had classified the chapter, part of a bigger 2002 congressional investigation into the   attacks, to protect intelligence sources and methods and, many believe, to avoid offending Saudi Arabia, an   US ally. Later investigations found no evidence that the Saudi government or senior Saudi officials knowingly backed the 19 hijackers, 15 of whom were from Saudi Arabia. But politicians and relatives of victims pushed to get the pages published because of questions over whether Saudi nationals in contact with the hijackers after they arrived in the US knew what they were plotting. Barack Obama ordered a declassification review. The House intelligence committee voted to reveal the pages but with certain redactions to protect sources. Devin Nunes, chairman of the committee, said: “I support the administration’s decision to declassify this section of the    joint inquiry. Because the information can be released without jeopardising national security, the American people should be able to access it. “However, it’s important to note that this section does not put forward vetted conclusions, but rather unverified leads that were later fully investigated by the intelligence community. ” Many of the intelligence community’s findings were included in the   commission report, he added, as well as in a newly declassified executive summary of a   joint assessment that will soon be released by the director of national intelligence. Perhaps most intriguingly, the 28 pages reveal that Osama Basnan, whom the documents describe as a supporter of two of the   hijackers in California, received a cheque from Prince Bandar, the former Saudi ambassador to the US. “On at least one occasion, Bassnan received a check directly from Prince Bandar’s account,” it says. “According to the FBI, on May 14, 1998, Bassnan cashed a check from Bandar in the amount of $15, 000. Bassnan’s wife also received at least one check directly from Bandar. ” Basnan lived across the street from two of the hijackers  —   Khalid   and Nawaf    —   in San Diego and told an FBI asset that he had helped them, according to the document. Basnan was allegedly a supporter of   mastermind Osama bin Laden and spoke of him “as if he were a god”. Meanwhile Tom Kean and Lee Hamilton, who were chairman and   of the   commission, emphasised that the 28 pages had been written before they started their investigation. “The   Commission was created, in part, to finish the work the congressional panel had begun,” they said in a joint statement. The 28 pages from 2002 were “based almost entirely on raw, unvetted material that had come to the FBI” they added. “That material was then written up in FBI files as possible leads for further investigation. As of June 2003 none of these leads had been checked out. The documents are therefore comparable to preliminary law enforcement notes, which are generally covered by grand jury secrecy rules. ” Kean and Hamilton also noted that last year the   review commission reviewed the   leads in the 28 pages and concluded that, despite the fact that two FBI teams continue to actively investigate the issue, “there was no new evidence against the Saudi government”. Adam Schiff, ranking member of the House intelligence committee, said: “I hope that the release of these pages, with appropriate redactions necessary to protect our nation’s intelligence sources and methods, will diminish speculation that they contain proof of official Saudi government or senior Saudi official involvement in the   attacks. “The intelligence community and the   commission, which followed the joint inquiry that produced these   28 pages, investigated the questions they raised and was never able to find sufficient evidence to support them. I know that the release of these pages will not end debate over the issue, but it will quiet rumours over their contents  —   as is often the case, the reality is less damaging than the uncertainty. ” Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, said he was pleased by the release. “The American public deserved to see the report’s declassified contents and now they can. ” Saudi Arabia also welcomed the decision, hoping it would draw a line under the matter. Its ambassador to the US, Abdullah   said: “Since 2002, the   commission and several government agencies, including the CIA and the FBI, have investigated the contents of the ‘28 pages’ and have confirmed that neither the Saudi government, nor senior Saudi officials, nor any person acting on behalf of the Saudi government provided any support or encouragement for these attacks. “We hope the release of these pages will clear up, once and for all, any lingering questions or suspicions about Saudi Arabia’s actions, intentions, or   friendship with the United States. ”

Sheriff’s tirade over Joe McKnight shooting is his personal brand of theater
Jefferson Parish sheriff Newell Normand stood before a crowd Monday to announce charges against the man who killed the former NFL player Joe McKnight. He knew there were some hostile audience members, after his initial decision to set suspect Ronald Gasser free on 1 December following what investigators have described as a road rage incident in the New Orleans suburb of Terrytown. So he was hostile. “Shame on you!” he yelled at his critics, banging his hands on the lectern. He shouted profanities. He accused the public, including people on social media, of rushing to judgment over the incident. He threatened to jail any protesters who might dare to block highway traffic in his parish. “You will go to jail,” he said, all while extolling the virtues of patience and trust in the law enforcement process. “I truly believe that Sheriff Normand’s choice of words are words of division,” said the Westbank NAACP president, Gaylor Spiller. And across social media, many of the same people Normand slammed responded with horror to the to the tone and of the announcement. The    McKnight was shot and killed by Gasser on 1 December. After the shooting, Gasser admitted to killing McKnight, but was not initially charged with any crime and allowed to leave police custody while the investigation continued, prompting outrage especially among the city’s black residents. McKnight, who was unarmed, is black. Gasser is white. “The police department is certainly not operating like it does ordinarily,” said New Orleans NAACP president Morris Reed in a Friday press conference. “We think a black man was lynched yesterday and we’re demanding some answers. ” Normand railed against those criticisms while announcing Gasser’s delayed arrest on manslaughter charges on Monday. “I can point to hundreds of cases whereby we’ve identified . .. accused perpetrators that we know have committed a crime that we do not arrest at the point and time of us knowing that for strategic reasons. “In this state, whether we like it or not, we have very   ‘stand your ground’   justifiable homicide laws,” Normand said. As the press conference drew on, however, Normand grew increasingly agitated and emotional, yelling: “We better look at ourselves and reflect in the mirror and decide what are we going to be about in our community. Are we going to continue to tear ourselves apart? We don’t even give people an opportunity to do what they’re supposed to do. ” MSNBC, which was broadcasting the conference live, cut away and apologized to viewers when the sheriff read from social media comments directed at local politicians in the case that included homophobic and racial slurs. Normand told reporters he read the comments aloud hoping to get “everyone to realize how crazy we’re getting”. Normand accused the public, and people on social media specifically, of rushing to judgment over the incident and “castigating” the law enforcement officials who initially allowed Gasser to go free. The comments read aloud by the sheriff were apparently directed at a black councilman who stood with Normand at his initial press conference on Friday. Both Normand’s decision to repeat the offensive language aloud on national television for shock value, and his overall emotional demeanor, have been par for the course during his tenure as sheriff.  Theatrics are a recurring feature of Normand’s command. In 2015, when an Evangelical Baptist church in the parish had relocated to a tent to accommodate construction on its building, the Jefferson Parish sheriff’s office began receiving noise complaints from neighbors. Normand wound up making more than one visit, in person, to the Sunday service with several deputies, examining the audio equipment to make sure it wasn’t being used and issuing a criminal summons. According to the Liberty Institute, the pastor was even fingerprinted in front of church members in connection with the violation. Parishioners described the visits as an act of intimidation. Emotional indignation is well within Normand’s repertoire, too. After police shot and killed    Desmond Willis during a shootout in April 2015, the sheriff showed press a video of Willis brandishing pistols and expressing contempt for police. “Where is the moral compass? I don’t see it, no way, no how,” Normand shouted. “No one asks for the names of the innocent people that were scared shitless that day as bullets were flying by their head,” he added before launching into an attack on the Black Lives Matter movement. Normand, a Republican, has won his two elections for sheriff overwhelmingly, earning more than 90% of the vote in both. Like most of the state, Jefferson Parish voters lean Republican and last month the parish broke for Donald Trump by 15 points, while residents in   Orleans Parish handed Hillary Clinton a commanding   win.  Jefferson Parish residents are used to large and controversial personalities in their elected sheriffs. Harry Lee, Normand’s predecessor of 28 years and a hugely popular local figure, had several racist scandals bubble up during his tenure, including one involving this remark in 1986: “If there are some young blacks driving a car late at night in a predominantly white neighborhood, they will be stopped. There’s a pretty good chance they’re up to no good. ” Parish residents are also no strangers to blatant racism from their elected officials. Two years after Lee’s remark, voters in Metairie sent the notorious white supremacist David Duke to the state legislature as their representative. In his press conference on Monday, Normand was emphatic that race had “nothing to do” with the McKnight case, stating that no credible witness had indicated that Gasser expressed any racial animus on the scene. Normand said that charges came after 10 hours of examination with Gasser, and more than 160 witness interviews. It was from that investigation that Normand concluded charges were warranted against Gasser, while declaring that both men “engaged in bad behavior that day”. Normand also heavily criticized one eyewitness whose account of the incident helped to spark the national outrage over Gasser’s delayed arrest. That witness stated that McKnight had tried to apologize to Gasser during the altercation, and that Gasser had fired into McKnight’s windshield, pulled him from his vehicle, fired a shot while standing above him, and made a reference to Trump. “We had a witness who lied,” Normand said. “Shame on that individual   …     That started something going down a path that we should be ashamed of. ”

Tables turned as vinyl sales overtake digital sales for first time in UK
It was once a pastime dominated by audiophile dads and nostalgic hipsters. But last week, for the first time in history, the amount of money spent on vinyl records in the UK overtook that spent on digital downloads. Vinyl sales hit £2. 4m last week compared with the £2. 1m made from digital music purchases, further proof that record shopping has gone mainstream. The interest in buying a physical format of music on vinyl has experienced a resurgence in the past 12 months. This time last year, the sale of vinyl albums reached £1. 2m while digital sales were £4. 4m. Vinyl has also experienced eight consecutive years of growth, despite almost dying out around 2006.  Kim Bayley, chief executive of the Entertainment Retailers Association, attributed the surge in part to the number of places now selling records across the UK. An increasing number of   record shops have opened, while supermarkets such as Sainsbury’s and Tesco, and even high street interiors shop Tiger, now stock records, making them easily accessible. Bayley said vinyl had experienced a particular boost in the past week because it was becoming an increasingly popular choice for Christmas presents.  “The vast majority of releases are coming out in vinyl now,” said Bayley. “It used to be that only heritage acts or niche albums would come out as a record, but now everything does  —   pop albums, compilations, film soundtracks, all genres. ” The top 10 records sold this week speak to the variety of people now buying vinyl. Kate Bush, Amy Winehouse and Busted are in the chart, alongside the Guardian of the Galaxy film soundtrack and Now That’s What I Call Christmas compilation album. Bayley added: “We have a new generation buying vinyl, lots of teenagers and lots of people under 25, who now want to buy their favourite artists on vinyl and have something a bit more tangible, a bit more collectible. People have become keen to support their favourite artists by buying into that ownership concept. It’s very difficult to demonstrate your love of an artist if you don’t have something to hold on to. ” Sean Forbes, who manages record shop Rough Trade West in London, which has been selling vinyl since 1979, said there was a “massive increase” in people buying vinyl and that new racks had been put in all Rough Trade shops to meet demand.  “Now it’s everyone who comes in to buy it, from    to    we get the whole breadth,” said Forbes. “We now get a lot of people come in with their kids, and mum and dad want to start them off with a starter pack of good records. But you also still have the    man who smells of weed who will always come into a record shop, stand around and then ask for something you haven’t got, and then leave. So it hasn’t changed completely. ” He said record companies were noticeably taking advantage of the renewed interest in vinyl and hiking prices, adding that “the   on vinyl now is ridiculous”. However, he said people were increasingly willing to spend upwards of £25 on a single record, and even more for limited editions. Kate Bush’s   live album Before the Dawn, which was selling at Rough Trade for £65, had completely sold out in its shops within a day.  Forbes admitted he had been surprised by the resurgence in people buying all types of music on record, although he welcomed it as a change from those who, in years past, bought certain heritage albums as a memento rather than to listen to.  “It makes a change from all the people visiting London who always come in just to buy The Clash London Calling on vinyl, which personally we think is a bit moronic,” said Forbes. “And people have always wanted to buy Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon on vinyl, which is also a bit depressing. People will still be buying fucking Dark Side of the Moon on vinyl when we’ve all been dead a hundred years. ”

Tom Ford: ‘I wore a suit on set. It’s a uniform… I feel weak in trainers’
As I enter the hotel suite, Tom Ford stands in silhouette against an industrial,   window, the light refracted behind him in a sunburst. It’s an irresistible image, so perfect it almost had to be composed: both man and room shown off to their optimal effect. And, who am I kidding, it probably was. I had been checked at the door for a minute or two while Ford had rearranged some furniture that was irking him. Even a rented room, used for a day to plug a new movie, can be improved. Ford is obsessed with beautiful things and has had an enduring and hugely successful career, first in fashion, now as a film director, making people and places look their best. Ford strides towards me, eager, like a politician on the election trail, and extends his hand. I had read that he prefers to be called “Mr Ford” and check if that’s the case. “No, no, no,” he smiles, as if it was one of the top five most ridiculous things he’s ever heard. “Pleeease call me Tom. ” Tom Ford, the man, has always been the most compelling advertisement for Tom Ford, the creative output. He is, it’s almost inane to note, a very handsome individual. These are looks that many would sell their souls for, but Ford, now an impossible 55 years old, hasn’t needed to: just lots of vegetables and fish, no booze for years, tennis three times a week and an occasional restrained   with Botox under the eyes and Just for Men dye on his beard stubble. Today, as he almost always does, Ford wears a cinched black suit, matching tie, a gold collar bar. “A suit is armour,” he explains. “You know, I’m not good in knitwear. ” His voice, almost a growl, is saturated with disdain. “I feel mushy and soft. I’m not good in anything but a boot. I feel solid and grounded. You gotta learn in life what makes you feel comfortable in terms of clothing and that’s what you should wear. Some people look great in knitwear that’s what they want to wear, they look good in it, it feels right for them. Trainers: I feel weak in trainers. I mean, I wear them when I’m at the gym, but I feel soft and I don’t like that. ” How about when he was shooting his new film, Nocturnal Animals, did Ford wear a suit then? “Yes, I wore it on set, it’s a uniform. I’m comfortable, it suits who I am,” he replies. “Except the parts when we were in Texas, where I wore cowboy boots and a cowboy hat, which looks surprisingly good on me. Well, all of a sudden, 200 years of Texas pioneer background kind of genetically seems to just work on my head. And I don’t look like a fool. ” Ford  —   I hope this is coming across  —   is surprisingly funny. He is completely serious and at the same time, nullifying the criticism often levelled at those in the fashion world, completely aware that some people will find what he’s saying ridiculous. There are numerous     that have attached themselves to Ford over the years. That he takes five baths a day. That he doesn’t like to see or smell food in his office. That he once sent an employee home for wearing    trousers. That he cannot abide hot drinks. That  —   this one courtesy of Victoria Beckham  —   he flies long haul in his suit and his only concession is to undo a single waistcoat button. Some people would regard him as eccentric, I say. “Eccentric?” says Ford, visibly perking up, his hands carving arcs, like a matador’s. “Oh, tell me about that!” The multiple baths in a day. “Oh, I can explain that,” he counters, a little disappointed perhaps that the rumour was not more outrageous. “For me, it’s meditation. I take a bath in the morning, because the time I lie in the bathtub is when I work out all my problems. I think about the day, I think about what I’ve got to do. I think about nothing, I clear my head. Same in the evening, before dinner, I can’t go from work and out to a dinner and be good at a dinner  —   meaning be interesting and charming and be interested and listen to someone  —   unless I kind of wash away the day. The same at night, I can’t go to sleep unless I get in the bathtub and again, wash away the day. So it’s meditative for me, it’s not that I have some cleanliness obsession. ” So that’s cleared that up. “I don’t smoke,” he goes on. “Some people go out and have a cigarette. I don’t drink, some people drink. ” He exhales theatrically. “I lie in a bath full of hot water. ” It is common, as shown here, to fixate on Ford’s aesthetic. This is, after all, how he made his name: he arrived, unheralded, as a designer at Gucci in 1990, when the company was on its knees when he departed in 2004, it was one of the world’s most desired luxury brands, owning Yves Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney, and valued at $10bn. In 2006, he started trading under his own name and there are now 122 Tom Ford stores, which take around $1bn each year in sales. Daniel Craig insists on Tom Ford suits for the Bond films, while Michelle Obama chose one of his gowns when she met the Queen. The idea, though, that he might be stronger on style than substance endured when Ford moved into film. His first feature, in 2010, was A Single Man, which followed a day in the life of a college professor, masterfully played by Colin Firth, who is contemplating suicide. It was a deeply assured debut and one that Ford was involved in every aspect of: as a writer  —   adapting Christopher Isherwood’s 1964 novel  —   director and producer, plunging in some of his own savings, not all of which were returned at the box office. Still, many reviewers struggled to see past the lush cinematography and Firth’s instantly iconic   spectacles. Peter Bradshaw in the Guardian wrote that it sometimes resembled “a   commercial for men’s cologne: Bereavement by Dior”. Ford believes, with some justification, that there is a perception of him as an individual that precedes his films. “I’m a very, very, very private person,” he says. “I’m also a very shy person. So what most people know of me is a product. It is a billboard. It is a selling tool. That’s not to say it’s false. It comes from me. Everything I make I am proud of. So this is a part of my personality, but it’s the surface. When I made A Single Man, I actually had people say to me, ‘My God, I didn’t realise you had such depth.’ It’s kind of shocking. You realise, ‘Oh,    …    ’” His point is that the real Ford is more than the guy with   who happens to look fantastic in aviators. “I’m glad that there is a large part of my character and my personality that is private,” he says. “You know, I don’t have a personal Instagram account, I’m not photographing my dinner every night and sending it out to the world. I’m quite private and the older I get the more I guard that, and the more famous I’ve become, the more and more and more I guard that. ” It’s not just reviewers, either. When Ford approached Jake Gyllenhaal to star in Nocturnal Animals, the actor has admitted that he was concerned Ford, whom he didn’t know at this point, would “focus on the aesthetic over the heart of the story”. Gyllenhaal, however, was quickly convinced after speaking to the director, as was Amy Adams, who signed on to play the female lead, Susan, a privileged but unhappy gallery owner. “I have to say, luckily most of the reviews of Nocturnal Animals have been terrific,” notes Ford. “But the very few criticisms have been that’s it’s too beautiful, too stylised. I think if I didn’t have another life as a fashion designer I wouldn’t be hearing that and people wouldn’t be judging that. “Not comparing myself to Hitchcock,” he continues, “but I’ll use him as an example. He was notorious for spending weeks on his leading ladies’ hair, makeup, look, clothes. What most directors do is intentional: how they frame something, whether it’s composed or not composed is part of telling the story. In this particular case, that very hard, lacquered, manufactured, glamorous life is part of the story. It’s key to understanding who Susan is and how she lives. It isn’t just random because I wanted to see some beautiful clothes and beautiful hair and beautiful makeup. This is part of the story. ” That story is something of a departure for Ford, as well. Nocturnal Animals   —   a Grand Jury prize winner at Venice  —   which is adapted, again by Ford, from a 1993 novel called Tony and Susan by Austin Wright, begins as very much a companion piece to A Single Man. Susan lives in a striking modernist house straight from the pages of Wallpaper* her husband, Hutton (Armie Hammer) seems to smell of money, but they clearly don’t much like each other. Susan has even inherited Colin Firth’s signature glasses. Everything changes, though, when Susan receives a package from her first husband, Edward (Gyllenhaal) whom she hasn’t seen in years: it’s a novel he’s written, dedicated to her a brutal   about a family travelling across the Texas desert who find themselves in an altercation with a gang of young droogs. Nocturnal Animals now starts flicking between Susan’s sedate, joyless life in Los Angeles and a   crime thriller that plays out in her head as she reads Edward’s book. Ford ultimately intertwines these stories into one suffocatingly intense narrative and makes powerful, sometimes stinging comments on the importance of loyalty, the thrill of revenge and the perils of consumerism. Yes, you read that straight: Tom Ford is railing against the perils of consumerism. A man whose eponymous fashion label sells an oversize Dakota bag for $6, 450 (£5, 250) and whose suits for men all cost in excess of $5, 000 (£4, 100). A man who owns a house in Bel Air designed by Richard Neutra, an 1827 John Nash Mayfair townhouse and a ranch in New Mexico, on land larger than Manhattan, with Tadao Ando buildings and an airstrip, which was recently put on the market for £60m. But Ford is no fool and well aware of the extreme potential for hypocrisy. “The character of Susan is quite autobiographical in some ways, she was a female version of me,” Ford admits. “Fortunate or not, I live in that world that Susan lives in. I know those people. A few years ago now, I really had a midlife crisis. I think a lot of my younger years  —   and a lot of people’s younger years, I bet  —   are spent achieving whatever it is, when you’re young, you think you need to do. Getting ahead in your career, getting this, getting that, buying your first apartment, getting married and then you realise, ‘OK, well I’ve done all that, now what? Is this what there is? ’” A low point came when he acrimoniously left Gucci: his drinking got out of control, he became depressed. “A lot of people keep it in check. I didn’t. That doesn’t mean you want to give up those material things, but it means you need to keep a balance and so yeah, I’ve struggled with that. And I’ve struggled with contemporary culture. Sometimes, contemporary culture revolts me. And where we’re moving, it just disgusts me. ” Ford shakes his head. He’s aware he’s asking questions and not supplying too many answers. “We’re culturally taught now that there’s this thing called happiness that’s achievable,” he sighs. Where we’re just happy because we’ve done this and that, we’ve gotten there, we’ve bought this house and we’ve got these kids and we’re just happy now. That’s a relatively new idea. Because happiness doesn’t exist. A happy morning exists and then maybe a depressing lunch and a bad afternoon and maybe a nice evening. We’re sold this concept and I realise that I’m one of the people that’s helping do this because I’m responsible also for our contemporary consumer culture. ” Ford grew up middle class in middle America, first in Texas, then New Mexico from the age of 11 his parents were   agents. From as early as he can remember, Ford had a singular fascination with style. He often chose to wear a suit as a child and was mercilessly bullied at school for carrying a briefcase. “Actually, it was an attache case,” he corrects. “But that’s true, they were really mean to me. I look back at pictures of myself in a little raincoat and briefcase and I just think, ‘Oh God  …    ’ But that was me and my parents just let me express who I was, which was also great. ” Again you get the impression, though he might deny it, that Ford has never been bothered by being regarded as eccentric. “I have a sister, she didn’t dress like that at all,” he says. “She’s not remotely interested in fashion, she’s an English teacher. She could have all the Tom Ford clothes she wants she doesn’t care. She’s quite beautiful but she’s never been into fashion. My mother is, however, and my grandmother was to the nth degree. So I had women around me who were. I don’t think I ever saw my mother without her makeup as a child. Ever. But that’s a very Texas thing. My first scent memories were hairspray  —   it was the early 1960s, I was sitting on the floor playing while she was getting dressed. ” Ford has been reflecting on his early years more since he’s become a parent himself. Jack was born four years ago, reportedly by   fertilisation and a surrogate, to Ford and Richard Buckley, a fashion writer and his partner of 30 years. “He’s going to grow up in a very privileged world and I want to make sure that he’s grounded,” says Ford, who, after 25 years living in Europe, mainly London, recently moved his primary residence to Los Angeles (“All of a sudden I needed some sun. I did! ”). “So a big consideration is to try to raise him in a very natural,   way. ” Jack’s arrival, Ford believes, has made him perhaps a fraction less uptight he’d hoped that Jack would play with tasteful, grey wooden toys, but his stark, beautiful houses are now defiled by lurid plastic. “At the end of the day, he always tells me about his day and I tell him about my day and Richard talks about his day,” says Ford. “The other night, Jack says, ‘Well, how was your day? You look sad.’ And I said, ‘Well, it was a tough day.’ Then he said, ‘You know, you say that every night.’ And I said, ‘I do?’ And he said, ‘Yeah. So what are you going to do about that?’ “And I thought, ‘Wow, what am I going to do about that?’ Their observations are so simple and so clear: ‘Well, you’re sad, you need to do something about that.’ It’s very interesting. Then I felt guilty and terrible: ‘Oh God, I’m going home every day and seeming sad and I should be really there for him.’ But you know, just the daily stresses of businesses sometimes get to you. ” Films make Ford happy, he insists, but he still retains a stubborn streak of melancholy. “Working, for me, keeps me distracted and keeps me from pondering the ultimate end to all of this, which is the same for all of us,” he says. “We have to let go of it all, we have to say goodbye to everything. That doesn’t terrify me, but I’m aware of it every second. And I think it’s one of the things that makes me appreciate things, because you realise this isn’t going to last, so I need to look at it, I need to experience it, I need to try to drink it in. Beauty I find so sad. There’s nothing sadder to me than true, true beauty because it is so temporary and so transient, so somehow you’ve got to embrace that aspect of it. “I don’t know,” he concludes, “I sound like a crazy person. I guess I’m quite philosophical and I spend an enormous amount of time pondering all of these things  —   in the bath. In the bath!” Seeing as much of modern culture, as he says, “disgusts” him, does Ford ever worry about the world that Jack will grow up in? “I think every generation feels that,” he replies. “You go back and read something 100 years old and that’s what adults are talking about. For them, it will be their world. And some day Kim Kardashian is probably going to be on some stage at Kennedy Center Honors [annual awards given to a handful of artists judged to have made a meaningful contribution to American culture] when she’s 80, getting an award. ” Ford claps, perhaps sarcastically. “And everyone’s going to say, ‘Oh my God, Kim Kardashian, don’t you remember when she was  …    ’” She will be their Marilyn. She will be there because this is the world we live in. ” It’s been seven years since A Single Man, but Ford has been keeping busy. He wanted to devote proper time to raising his son. Meanwhile, the fashion juggernaut rolls on, requiring a new collection for men and women twice a year. There were false starts, too, before he settled on Nocturnal Animals as the script to pursue. “There’s been work. Thought. And things I turned down. ” He laughs. “And two screenplays I wrote that are not so good and I wouldn’t make. ” Ford continues to love clothes and he’s proud of the enduring popularity of Tom Ford, but it’s hard not to feel that he has little left to prove in that world. He pretty well admits as much. “There’s a moment in fashion when you think of the idea,” he says. “You think, ‘Oh God, fuck, that’s it!’ And a lot of times you’re wrong and it doesn’t work at all, but that moment when you think it does is great. But fashion is very fleeting. You can look at that same thing the next year and you’re like, ‘OK, yeah that’s nice.’ And you look at it years later in a museum and you go, ‘Well, that’s interesting, look at how I did that stitching, that was great.’ But it never has the power that it does at the very beginning. “And film does,” he continues. “You watch an old film, everyone’s dead but you’re crying with them, you’re emoting with them it’s the most rewarding thing if you’re someone who wants to express themselves. It’s the most permanent thing I think that we have. Even painting. Let’s take abstract expressionism. The very first time people saw an abstract painting it would have been shocking. Today, it’s modern vocabulary, we see it everywhere, it can’t have the [same] power. Film doesn’t do that. Film, if it’s not something that’s easily dated, if it’s genuine, has the same power when you watch it 30 years, 40 years, 80 years later. It’s not diluted. And that’s incredible. ” There’s a stubborn sniffiness about a fashion designer making films, but the process is remarkably similar, Ford has found. Both require a strong vision, something to say and the ability to command an army of hired hands, working them hard without demoralising them, inspiring them to bring to life what you have in your head. Both activities also suit an obsessive,   temperament. It’s easy to mock the idea of Ford luxuriating in three baths a day, but he wakes at 4. 30am, barely sleeps and can subsist for days on just iced coffee and Oreo Thins. Ford has also brought a mastery of the   stunt to both fields, often involving nudity. One advertisement for Gucci, shot by Mario Testino, featuring a female model pulling down her pants to show a G shaved in her pubic hair. Sophie Dahl sprawled libidinously on a silk sheet for Opium by Yves Saint Laurent, meanwhile, found its way on to the Advertising Standards Agency’s “Top 10 Most Complained About Ads” list. Ford, though, has always considered himself “an   objectifier” and in 2002 he showed a male martial artist full frontal in an ad for YSL’s M7 fragrance. The opening scenes of Nocturnal Animals have been causing a similar fuss at film festivals. It depicts a montage of     women dancing naked in slow motion. They are accessorised with bits and pieces of Americana while glitter tumbles around them. Eventually, the viewer clicks that it is in fact a video art piece that is being projected in Susan’s gallery. So Tom Ford, what were you  …     “What were you thinking?” he interjects. “What the hell was that?” Exactly. “When I was young I had a poster of Farrah Fawcett in a red bikini, which I’m sure you’ve seen, with the big teeth and hair, and I think that was a lot of people’s idea of America: the land of tans, beauty and youth,” Ford explains. “And I decided that today, perhaps, to the outside world America looks gluttonous, overfed, ageing, sagging, decrepit. So I shot that and I had the most fun day making that. These women were so happy to be there, they were so free, they were just liberated, they were spectacular. I fell in love with them. And I realised that actually they were the opposite of Susan: they were joyful because they had let go of what they were supposed to be and they were just themselves. Whether you like them or hate them and think they are fat or not fat, they were themselves. And they were comfortable with that. So that became the opening art sequence. ” Ford has clearly thought about his defence, marshalled his arguments, but he can’t help a mischievous aside. “From a practical standpoint and a theatrical standpoint, it also pulls you right into the film from the beginning,” he says. “Gets your attention and that’s important. And then you’re like, ‘Where’s this going?’ And you’re watching. ” Nocturnal Animals is likely to surprise many people: it is smarter, more visceral, more   than doubters would have expected from Tom Ford, while still being just as beguiling to look at. He draws compelling,   performances from Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Shannon, as a nihilistic Texas policeman charged with tracking down the thugs. It is a terrific film that stirs and aggressively challenges the head, eyes and heart. Ford vows that it won’t be seven years before he has a new movie project he’ll never be prolific, partly because he wants to be involved in every stage of the process, but three years is more like it. What about children, would he like more? “Originally, I thought yes however now I think no,” he says. “I love Jack, we’re a great family, we’re very happy, the three of us. I’m not a young dad, Richard’s an even older dad. If I pick Jack up out of the bathtub and he wiggles the wrong way, it throws my back out. I think there’s a reason why people have children when they’re in their 20s and 30s! So no, we’re really happy as a family as we are. ” This is perhaps the most shocking moment of the interview: Ford, a man who seems personally to defy the progress of time, acknowledges that he is getting older. As we wrap up our conversation, I ask him if he’s just a bit terrified about ageing. “I think it’s time I started ageing, otherwise I’ll start looking odd,” he says. “You have to give in to it. I mind the physical part that comes with it, but the actual mindset that comes with it, I love. Because while I don’t like it, I also don’t care as much. So what? This is who I am. ” What about letting himself go grey? He looks at me sternly, then a little hurt. “What makes you think I’m grey? !” Then his voice rumbles like a muscle car revving its engine: “Oh no, I’ve planned on going grey. I know exactly when I’ll go grey. I have a four‑  child, there’s lots of time to go grey. I plan on living into my 90s, so maybe 72, 73, 74, I’ll go grey. Then I’ll have a good 20 years of grey. ” A stickler for good manners, he walks me to the door of the suite. “That’s plenty. ” Nocturnal Animals is out on 4 November

Italy earthquake: residents fear historic towns will never look the same
The earth has not yet finished shaking, but 24 hours after a 6.  earthquake reduced historic towns and villages in the Apennine mountains to rubble, the focus of residents and political leaders has already turned to the huge rebuilding task ahead. Authorities are dealing with both the immediate crisis of rehoming the 15, 000 people displaced by the series of earthquakes, and   questions about the kinds of homes suitable for an area at risk of future tremors. Not least of these questions is who will pay for them. “Give us back our tents” has become the unofficial mantra of some residents in the town of Norcia. They are refusing to leave their damaged homes, despite falling temperatures. “They’re not just tents,” one resident, Adolfo, told La Repubblica. “They’re comfortable and heated. [They] allow us to remain here to be able to confront the difficulties of this hour. ” Italy’s civil protection agency said it was moving about 500 people into hotels near Lake Trasimeno in Umbria and more than 4, 000 into hotels on the Adriatic coast an additional 3, 000 are staying in reception centres in Umbria and Marche. In Rome  —   where a major bridge, Ponte Mazzini near Trastevere, was closed to cars and pedestrians on Monday after the discovery of a crack caused by the earthquake  —   the prime minister, Matteo Renzi, dismissed the idea that residents could stay in tents given the approaching winter. “There are hotels for everyone,” he wrote in his weekly newsletter. “But many of our compatriots do not want to leave their areas, not even for a few weeks. So we’ll have to manage this initial emergency phase in the best way possible. ” Renzi is due to convene a cabinet meeting on Monday evening to discuss rebuilding efforts. For people in the   areas of Umbria, Marche, and parts of rural Lazio  —   where the town of Amatrice was levelled by an earthquake in August  —   Monday was the beginning of what is likely to be a long and contentious struggle to rebuild towns and villages without damaging their cultural heritage.  The rural regions are famous not only for their food but for the ancient stone used to build walls and homes the material has not proved to be as resilient as wood or other materials used in other   areas. For the first step of the rebuilding, the Italian civil protection agency will decide whether the homes left standing are safe enough to be  .  Cecilia Anesi, an investigative journalist who lives in Umbria and witnessed the devastating quake of 1997, said the next big question would be whether the government would seek to rebuild homes in wood and concrete, or whether it would maintain the region’s style and heritage. “The consequence of rebuilding everything in a modern way, using wood or concrete, means we won’t have historical centres any more, which are the soul of Umbria and Marche. It’s a very confusing moment,” she said.  “The government could rebuild houses in the ancient style by securing them with concrete, but it is very costly. The decision seems to be between quickly creating new homes, or saving heritage and with heritage, cultural identity. ” Anesi said historic churches needed to be protected and reinforced, because they were were often the first structures to fail in earthquakes. Paolo Bazzurro, professor of hazard and risk assessment at the University Institute for Superior Studies (IUSS) in Pavia, said he did not believe residents would consider rebuilding homes in wood to be an acceptable solution, even though they would be safer. “We are talking about people who have been living in small villages their entire life, so they want something that looks like the village they had. Rebuilding something that can be accepted is a big social sciences problem,” Bazzurro said. Despite promises by Renzi on Sunday of a total rebuilding programme, many residents may look to the experience of towns such as L’Aquila, which was devastated by an earthquake in 2009, and conclude that vast areas of the region may never be rebuilt. Seven years after the deadly quake, much of L’Aquila looks like a construction site deserted streets are still cordoned off to pedestrians. Mariagrazia Benvenuti, who has a home in the village of Sellano, knows from   experience how long it can take to rebuild in the area. She is still waiting for her home to be reconstructed, 19 years after the area sustained major earthquake.  She blames incompetence and official inaction. “There are buildings that have been crumbling for years, for which the municipality is uninterested despite the demands of citizens,” she said.

Arrests after US tourist alleges she was drugged and gang raped in India
Indian police arrested four men on Monday on suspicion of drugging and raping an American tourist who visited Delhi earlier this year. The    woman alleges that during the April trip she given spiked water in her hotel room and sexually assaulted by five men over two days. She returned to the US but “had no memory of what happened to me while I was in India,” the woman told NDTV. “I regained my memory three months later around the end of July and that’s when I took action. ” Police launched a formal investigation earlier this month after the woman filed a complaint through an American charity. A Delhi police spokesman, Dependra Pathak, said the suspects included a tour guide, a cleaner, a driver and an another employee of the Apeejay Surrendra Park Hotel.  The victim had recorded her testimony and will return to the US on Tuesday evening, Pathak said. The woman said the arrests were a “positive step”. The suspects, all aged between 20 and 24, have told investigators they are being falsely accused, the Press Trust of India reported. The alleged assault as one of the latest in a series of sex attacks on foreigners in India, reigniting concerns about women’s safety in the country. A    Japanese tourist was raped in southern India last month. In June, five men were jailed for life for   a    Danish tourist in New Delhi in 2014. India introduced tough laws against sex offenders in the wake of the fatal   of a student in the capital in December 2012 that sparked mass street protests. But high levels of sexual violence against women continue.

Kayla Mueller abduction: MSF withheld key information from us, parents say
The humanitarian organization Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) withheld vital information from the family of the Islamic State hostage Kayla Mueller for almost two months, her parents said in an interview broadcast on Friday. “They’re a fabulous organization. They do wonderful work,” Carl Mueller, the aid worker’s father, said in an ABC   documentary. “But somewhere in a boardroom they decided to leave our daughter there to be tortured and raped. ” Mueller’s parents say MSF, which is also known as Doctors Without Borders, withheld for almost two months an email address their daughter’s captors had asked be given to her parents in order for negotiations to begin. Kayla Mueller, who was not an MSF employee, is one of four Americans to have been abducted by Isis in Syria. She was captured in August 2013, before the group had risen to global prominence, having travelled to Aleppo with her boyfriend, Syrian photographer Omar Alkhani, to help fix a satellite at an MSF hospital. The job took longer than expected and the two stayed overnight. The next day, they were abducted while driving in an MSF vehicle to a bus stop to return to southern Turkey, where Mueller was based. After a failed rescue attempt on the weekend of 4 July 2014, and botched negotiations, Mueller died in captivity. Questions remain about the cause of her death: Isis says she was killed in a coalition airstrike, which the US denies. The Muellers discussed their daughter’s 18 months in captivity in an   documentary. On Wednesday, in anticipation of the release of the program, MSF released a statement that explained its version of events. The group has maintained it would never have permitted Mueller to come to Aleppo had it known of her intentions. It had already banned some foreign workers from operating in Syria, as kidnappings had become rife. “MSF’s security policy therefore forbid people from certain countries, including the US, from working at or even visiting the hospital,” the organization said.  Five MSF workers were taken hostage in northern Syria after Mueller’s abduction. Two of them, Frida Saide and Patricia Chavez, told ABC they were held with Mueller in a cell that was guarded by the notorious British Isis fighters that other hostages named “the Beatles”.  The women, who had not spoken out before, described Mueller as strong and said that she would exchange letters with another American hostage, Steven Sotloff. The hostages created a makeshift game of Trivial Pursuit, they said. In September 2014, Sotloff was beheaded. Mueller’s family said she was tortured from the start of her captivity, her fingernails being ripped out and her head shaved. Later, they said, she was forced into marriage with Isis leader Abu Bakr   who repeatedly raped her.  MSF negotiated the release of Mueller’s cellmates, who managed to smuggle out a letter from Mueller addressed to her parents. They were also instructed by the captors to pass along an email address to the family, to begin negotiations for her release. MSF said it shared the letter with Mueller’s family but withheld the email address out of fear for the safety of the remaining hostages. The MSF statement said: “The captors had also given the women a letter that they wanted delivered to Kayla’s parents, but Kayla herself asked the women not to pass along this other letter. ”  After MSF was able to negotiate the release of its remaining staff about six weeks later, the family learned of the email address.  “We regret the fact that Marsha Mueller had to reach out to us first before we did so,” MSF said in its statement. “We should have reached out to the family first, and we have apologized to the Muellers for that. ” The ABC documentary included audio of a tense telephone exchange between the Muellers and MSF’s director in Syria at the time, who was not named. “You’ll send that email right away after we hang up?” said an emotional Carl Mueller.  “We prefer to do it tomorrow, if that’s OK?” the director responded. “No, that’s not OK   …     every day to us is a critical time,” Mueller said. “Every hour. ” After a pause, the director replied: “OK. Yes. ” In its statement, MSF said that if the captors received any indication that staff members had smuggled out a letter, it would have jeopardized the lives of those who remained in captivity. The group also said negotiating hostage release for   members could endanger its work in the future. “If MSF were generally considered by   abductors to be a negotiator of release for   staff, there is no doubt that this would increase the risk levels in many locations,” the statement said.  The documentary also reiterated the Mueller family’s criticism of the way in which the Obama administration has handled kidnappings. The Muellers said Barack Obama had refused to meet them until after the beheading of the American journalist James Foley, in August 2014.  In the meeting, Carl Mueller said, Obama was cold. He added that the president had pledged to make a donation to a foundation set up in Kayla’s honor. Seventeen months later, that donation has not been received, the family said.  In a press briefing on Friday, White House spokesperson Josh Earnest did not provide reasons for the delay. He said the Obamas would be making a donation to the foundation. “I would anticipate that they [the Obamas] would make a financial contribution to continue supporting it,” he said.

Bomb-detecting spinach – the new weapon against terrorist plots
Name:   spinach. Age: The cutting edge of military technology. Appearance: It looks like spinach. Hey, this sounds like an Eddie Izzard routine. Well, it isn’t. It’s the endpoint of an extensive biotechnology project at MIT that could potentially alter the course of the war on terror. Are you sure? What’s next, bees with machine guns? No, this involves research published in the respected science journal Nature Materials, detailing mankind’s quest to harness biological material as an enhanced environmental monitor, and there is no place for your tired whimsy here. I’ve got it  —   a jam bazooka! Stop. Fine. Tell me more about this   spinach that I’m apparently not allowed to joke about. Thank you. Darpa, the organisation that funds military science in the US, has been trying to find a form of vegetation that wilts when exposed to explosive material. Someone should cordon off my fridge then. It must be full of bombs! First, the idea is that these could be planted in areas vulnerable to terrorist attack, potentially saving hundreds of lives in the process. Second, I thought I told you to stop. OK, buzzkill. What’s the technology involved? It’s complicated, but in short it involves allowing fluorescent nanoparticles to be absorbed into a plant’s leaves. If explosives are detected in its water supply, the plant wilts and authorities are notified. And why plants? To quote MIT’s Michael Strano: “Plants have   power sources and are able to move fluids around very efficiently. They   are cheap and abundant, are naturally adapted to survive outdoors and have a negative carbon footprint. ” And terrorists won’t notice them   …     unless they radicalise Alan Titchmarsh! Unless they radicalise Alan Titchmarsh, yes, very good. How many adorable sniffer dogs is this going to put out of action? Who knows? Although, given that they will no longer run the risk of being blown to smithereens by an unseen malevolent force, I can’t see many of them minding. You’re no fun today. This is comedy gold and you’re stamping all over it. What can I say? It’s a skill. Do say: “Please be seated for tonight’s main feature: an   remake of The Hurt Locker. ” Don’t say: “Whatever you do, nobody arm Isis with trowels. ”

Trump attacks Clinton as ’trigger-happy’ as he vows to expand military
Donald Trump derided Hillary Clinton as a warmonger on Wednesday, saying: “Sometimes it seems like there wasn’t a country in the Middle East Clinton didn’t want to invade,” even as he called for a major increase in US defense spending. In the speech at the Union League in Philadelphia, a      institution crammed with portraits of civil war generals and   club presidents, Trump laid out his vision for a more robust US military paired with a cautious foreign policy. Trump railed against his Democratic opponent as having been “  and very unstable” during her tenure as secretary of state, claiming that she produced “only turmoil, suffering and death” while in office. By contrast, the Republican nominee promised to “prioritize diplomacy over destruction” and pledged that in his administration “our actions in the Middle East will be tempered by realism”. The address, billed as a policy speech on military readiness, marked Trump’s second on policy in the past week after addressing immigration last Wednesday in Phoenix. Trump has taken a more scripted approach in recent weeks, which have seen Hillary Clinton’s lead narrow in national polls. Trump also called for an end to the sequester, the automatic spending cuts that took effect in 2013 as part of a budget deal in Congress, which forced significant cuts in both defense and   spending. Trump only called for an end to the defense cuts, arguing that deep cuts in the military “invite more aggression” and, without increased spending, “we will have aggression like you’ve never seen before”. At the time the sequester went into effect, the Republican nominee dismissed its impact. He told Fox News in 2013 that concern about it was “ ” and dismissed naysayers, saying “a lot of things are not going to happen that people are thinking are going to happen. ” Clinton called for an end to the sequester at a speech to the American Legion in Cincinnati on 31 August. “We cannot impose arbitrary limits on something as important as our military,” the Democratic nominee said. “That makes no sense at all. The sequester makes our country less secure. Let’s end it and get a budget deal that supports America’s military, our families, and our country. ” Trump proposed to use the increased defense budget to expand the army to 540, 000 people, the navy to 350 ships, and the air force to at least 1, 200 fighter aircraft, as well as to develop a missile defense system. A number of the recommendations were based on a report from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative thinktank based in Washington that Republicans have long relied on for policy recommendations. The size of the armed forces has been reduced in recent years, with the army moving towards a   goal of reducing its force to 450, 00 active duty soldiers. The marine corps has only 23 battalions, which the Heritage Foundation has argued is below the minimum of 30 needed for the United States to fight two major regional conflicts simultaneously. Trump also pledged to build a “    missile defense program” which he said would create a significant number of jobs. He said: “Accomplishing this missile rebuild will be a   effort. Every state in the union will be able to take part rebuilding our military and developing the technologies for tomorrow. ” The Republican nominee provided few details about how this massive increase in spending would be funded. Trump talked vaguely of “commonsense reforms that eliminate government waste and budget gimmicks” as well as “reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy through responsible workforce attrition”. One specific measure Trump suggested was “respectfully asking Germany, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia to pay more for the tremendous security we provide them”. Trump was confident that those countries will “fully understand” and insisted currently “we are subsidizing them for billion of dollars”. Trump has previously pledged to greatly increase infrastructure spending and slash tax rates, all while maintaining current entitlement spending. Trump also reiterated a statement he first made at a Tuesday night rally in Greenville, North Carolina, that, after being elected, he would “ask the generals to present a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy Isis”. Previously, Trump has said he had a secret plan to defeat Isis that he did not want to share, telling Fox News in May 2015: “I don’t want the enemy to know what I’m doing. ” The Wednesday speech’s more sedate setting came after Trump delivered his most recent policy speech on immigration to a roaring crowd in Phoenix last week. Trump admitted to reporters on Monday that the setting may have led to his more strident than expected tone. “You had 15, 000 people and 10, 000 outside and they were going wild,” Trump told reporters on his aircraft. “A lot of that the noise was unbelievable, it’s possible when you make a speech like that you’re better off doing it for 150 people in front of the Washington Press Club. ” In a press release issued before his speech, Trump also said that among his first requests as    would be to ask the joint chiefs of staff as well as other departments to identify potential vulnerabilities in the US’s  . Clinton has suggested that the Russian government is using   to meddle in the US presidential election, after a host of emails were leaked in a hack of the Democratic National Committee. Trump has downplayed the severity of these hacks and even once apparently jokingly invited Russia to hack Clinton’s emails and release the findings. In a clear dig at his Democratic opponent, Trump said he would “enforce all classification rules, and enforce all laws relating to the handling of classified information”.  Clinton reportedly told the FBI in a July interview about her use of a private email server that she could not recall key details and events related to classified information procedures, according to notes recently released by the bureau. Trump and his campaign have seized on this, saying Clinton’s apparent irreverence to the classification rules should “disqualify” her from seeking the presidency.

Andy Murray overcomes ‘tough and tricky’ spell against Marcel Granollers
Andy Murray was pleased to come through a difficult period against Marcel Granollers as he recorded his second successive   win to reach the third round of the US Open. “There was a   to   period in the match where it was tough and tricky,” he said of his       win in two hours and 22 minutes over the Spaniard under the roof on Arthur Ashe on day four. That followed his opening win in similarly convincing fashion against the altogether different skills of Lukas Rosol on Monday. He added: “I got myself in a situation that maybe I could have avoided if I had taken one or two of the set points that I had at   or  . But I thought I did pretty well. There were some good points in there. That period of the match was very tough. I didn’t play that well during that period and managed to come through it, thankfully, and play some good stuff in the second and third sets. “I served at like 40, 42% first serves or something and still won in straight sets. I must have been doing things well other than serving. I was obviously hitting the ball pretty well and returning pretty good. But I could serve better, for sure. I only got broken once in a game where I had game points. It was all right. ” Murray said playing under the new roof provided some new challenges  —   not the least of them having to pick up the sound of the ball against the background of an echo in the cavernous stadium. “I don’t think it was too different to the other night when I played but, when the rain came, it was certainly loud. You can’t hear anything, really. You could hear the line calls, but not so much the opponent’s [shots] when he was hitting the ball or even when you’re hitting the ball, really, which is tough purely because we’re not used to it. That’s what makes it challenging. “We use our ears when we play. It’s not just the eyes. It helps us pick up the speed of the ball, the spin that’s on the ball, how hard someone’s hitting it. If we played with our ears covered or with headphones on, it would be a big advantage if your opponent wasn’t wearing them. It’s tricky. You know, you can still do it but it’s harder, for sure. “It’s definitely louder [than Wimbledon] but I don’t think it changed the conditions on the court as much as it does at Wimbledon. “When the roof is on, the humidity picks up significantly [at Wimbledon] whereas here it’s always humid, even when the roof is open. ”

MacOS Sierra: top five things you need to know about Apple’s new Mac software
OS X is dead. Long live macOS. Apple’s new version of its Mac operating system  —   Sierra  —   will be available for download later today. The free upgrade is available for almost any Mac from late 2009 and will be available via the Mac App Store later today. While some might want to hold off immediately updating, given the recent trouble with early updates, here are five new things to be found by those who do wish to change to macOS Sierra. The biggest change for Sierra other than the name is Siri. The same voice assistant from the iPhone and iPad is now on the Mac with similar features and faults. It can find files for you using natural language as introduced with El Capitan, set appointments, check spellings, play music and tell you the weather, but how much you use it depends on where you work: colleagues in your   office aren’t going to love the fact that you just started talking to your computer. Have you ever wanted to paste something between two Macs or a Mac and an iPhone or iPad? Now you can. Just copy something on one machine, hit paste on the other and wait. Sometimes it takes a while, depending on how good your connection is, but it works surprisingly well. It works for text, images and most other things you might copy to the clipboard. While some are organised and store all their files in carefully organised folders, many just have everything dumped on the desktop and locked on a single machine. iCloud Drive desktop can now sync files and folders on the desktop between machines and to iPhones or iPads, so everything not organised is accessible from multiple machines. The tabbed interface kickstarted by browsers has now come to more or less everything in Sierra. From text editors to photos editing, budgeting apps and email, hitting the “Merge All Windows” option under the Window drop down in the status bar merges the windows from one app into one tabbed interface. Not everything supports it immediately, and some that do have   implementations, but if you wanted tabs everywhere on a Mac, now’s your chance. Aside from big Mac features, MacOS Sierra also adds compatibility with most of the new features from iOS 10. Now you can pay for things using your Touch ID sensor on your iPhone on the web, you can send fancy chat things with iOS 10 users in Messages, view videos handled by the Quicktime Player in a floating window, and even unlock your Mac using an Apple Watch, if you own one. Apple Music in iTunes now looks more like the iOS version too, and the Memories feature from the iOS Photos app is now in the MacOS Sierra Photos app. MacOS also promises to free up some space on your Mac by storing unused files within iCloud drive, but how much space it can free up depends on what types of files are taking up your hard drive.

Judge rejects riot charges for journalist Amy Goodman after oil pipeline protest
A North Dakota judge rejected prosecutors’ “riot” charges against Democracy Now! host Amy Goodman for her reporting on the oil pipeline protests, a decision that advocates hailed as a major victory for freedom of the press. After the   broadcast journalist filmed security guards working for the Dakota access pipeline using dogs and pepper spray on protesters, authorities issued a warrant for Goodman’s arrest and alleged that she participated in a “riot” a serious offense that could result in months in jail. On Monday, judge John Grinsteiner ruled that the state lacked probable cause for the riot charge, blocking prosecutors from moving forward with the controversial prosecution. “I feel vindicated. Most importantly, journalism is vindicated,” Goodman told reporters and supporters on a live Facebook video on Monday afternoon. “We have a right to report. It’s also critical that we are on the front lines. Today, the judge sided with   …     freedom of the press. ”  The case stems from a 3 September report when Goodman traveled to the Native   protest against a controversial $3. 8bn oil pipeline that the Standing Rock Sioux tribe says is threatening its water supply and cultural heritage. Goodman’s dispatch on the use of dogs went viral and has since garnered 14m views on Facebook and also prompted coverage from many news outlets, including CBS, NBC, NPR and CNN. The North Dakota state attorney’s office had originally charged the journalist with “criminal trespass”. But last week, prosecutors emailed Goodman’s attorney, admitting that there were “legal issues with proving the notice of trespassing requirements in the statute” according to Democracy Now! Instead, the state said it would be seeking riot charges. “If the prosecutor thought he was going to intimidate Amy, he severely misjudged the situation,” Reed Brody, one of Goodman’s lawyers, told the Guardian after the judge’s decision on Monday. In one email, state’s attorney Ladd Erickson alleged that Goodman “was not acting as a journalist” according to Democracy Now! However, the original trespassing complaint noted that she is a reporter, with prosecutors writing that Goodman “can be seen on video identifying herself and interviewing protesters”. Erickson claimed to the local Bismarck Tribune newspaper that Goodman was “a protester, basically” adding: “Everything she reported on was from the position of justifying the protest actions. ” Goodman  —   who has written for the Guardian in the past  —   is a critically acclaimed progressive host and executive producer of Democracy Now! a program that airs on more than 1, 400 stations across the globe. She has also   six New York Times bestsellers. During the September dispatch, Democracy Now! quoted one protester describing the dogs violently attacking activists: “These people are just threatening all of us with these dogs. And she, that woman over there, she was charging, and it bit somebody right in the face. ” “The dog has blood in its nose and its mouth,” Goodman said at the time. “Why are you letting their, her dog go after the protesters? It’s covered in blood. ” An unprecedented gathering of Native American protesters has emerged over the past month to protest against the pipeline, which is scheduled to transport fracked crude from the Bakken oil field in North Dakota to a refinery near Chicago. Last week, actor Shailene Woodley, star of The Fault In Our Stars and the Divergent series, was arrested alongside 26 other activists at the pipeline protests. Depending on the specific charge, Goodman could have faced several months or up to a year if convicted, according to Brody. The riot claim was particularly unusual and disturbing, the lawyer added. “I’ve never seen it. This case is a real outlier in general in the United States. ”  Brody said he hoped the state would stop targeting Goodman and other journalists. “He tried one charge. He tried another. At a certain point, I would think it would become too embarrassing for him to pursue these charges. ”  The case backfired on prosecutors by prompting many journalists to write about law enforcement’s questionable responses to protesters, he added. “If he thought these charges were going to deflect media attention from the pipeline, then he really blew it. ”  The Freedom of the Press Foundation noted that Goodman was arrested in 2008 for covering Minnesota protests at the Republican national convention. She later won $100, 000 from the state in a first amendment lawsuit. The foundation slammed the prosecution in a statement before the court appearance: “Not only are they flagrantly violating the constitution, they are giving every   dictator and corrupt police establishment around the world every excuse to point to this episode and arrest journalists abroad, while making a mockery of our own press freedom protections at home. ” Erickson, the state’s attorney, declined to say whether his office would end its prosecution of Goodman. “The case against her and the other people we submitted for charges is still under review,” he said in an email. “Don’t know if that will mean charges or not [at] this point. ” Kyle Kirchmeier, the local county sheriff, said he is continuing to investigate Goodman and others arrested at the protests and that prosecutors are still exploring options to move the case forward. “I am assured charges are being considered against these individuals,” he said in a statement, adding: “Let me make this perfectly clear, if you trespass on private property, you will be arrested. ”

America’s choice this November is between a populist and a technocrat
Trump isn’t fit to serve as president of the United States. Clinton isn’t relating emotionally to the electorate. These points of contention seem to be at the heart of debates around this year’s presidential election. Gone is the traditional division between left and right, or liberalism and conservatism. What we are seeing instead, is a competition between technocracy and populism. It is little surprise that this election has been described as a choice between the “lesser of two evils”. We have a reliable, if uncharismatic, policy wonk on one hand and an entertaining, if unpredictable, maverick on the other. And it is this opposition  —   competence v charisma  —   rather than substantive policy disagreements, that is framing the election. Consider that, when it comes to policy positions, these two candidates are among the most different in recent memory. Yet such differences don’t really seem to be at the center of attention, either for the candidates themselves, or the public at large. In their recent debate, Clinton said explicitly that she intends to “increase taxes” for the rich and address the “systemic racism” of the country’s criminal justice system: positions that not even Obama had dared to take so plainly four or eight years ago. Trump instead declared he intends to lower taxes for the top income brackets and dismissed the problem of racism as a question of “law and order”. Similarly, on international trade, they took almost diametrically opposed stances: Clinton sees it as a factor of growth and stability, whereas Trump says trade is “killing our country”. Yet all this somehow remains in the background. The real core of what Clinton was attempting to communicate is that she is more competent than her rival, because she has greater policy expertise. This explains her reliance on the opinion of “independent experts” to make the case for her economic plan, as well as the insistence on “ ” Trump’s assertions. Conversely, most of Trump’s efforts went into depicting Clinton as a political insider, who is responsible for the “mess” the country is supposedly in at the moment, while presenting himself as a “strong leader” who can solve the country’s problems precisely by virtue of his decisive and unconventional approach. The roots of this populist drift in the Republican party go back several decades. Although the party’s current establishment professes to be outraged by at least some of Trump’s excesses, there is a direct line of continuity running from the late 1990s’ bid to impeach Bill Clinton over the Lewinsky affair, to George W Bush’s   as the candidate one would “most like to have beer with” the choice of Sarah Palin as John McCain’s running mate in 2012 and many features of Trump’s current campaign. The Democrats’ response has been to move progressively towards the center, assuming the mantle of “reason” and “respectability” while presenting their rivals as irresponsible mavericks. No wonder the substantive policy differences between them have fallen into the background: when politics is structured around the opposition between competent technocrats on one hand and   populists on the other, there is little room left for substantive policy disagreement in the middle. Nor is America alone in this shift. The debate over Brexit in the UK was fought along the same axis of opposition. The core of the Remain campaign’s argument rested on the opinion of “experts” according to which leaving the European Union would have had objectively catastrophic consequences for the country. In contrast, the Leave campaign appealed to many of the same sentiments that underscore Trump’s appeal: widespread   feeling, guttural nationalism and concerns about immigration and international trade. The paradox is that all this is depoliticizing public debate, precisely as campaigns become more bitter and conflictual. Democratic politics depends on the confrontation between rival political agendas and ideological visions. But in the struggle between technocrats and populists all we are left with is the choice between preserving the system as it is or burning it all to the ground. For those who want meaningful political alternatives, this doesn’t bode well.

Peter Thiel, who gave $1.25m to Trump, has called date rape ’belated regret’
When Mark Zuckerberg defended board member Peter Thiel’s $1. 25m donation to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign this week, the Facebook CEO emphasized that support of the candidate did not necessarily constitute “accepting sexual assault”.  But part of Thiel’s 1995 book The Diversity Myth: Multiculturalism and Political Intolerance on Campus suggests that he may sympathize more with Trump  —   who has recently been accused of sexual assault and misconduct by several women  —   than with his victims. The PayPal   attempted to discredit the idea of date rape  —   he wrote that the definition of rape had been erroneously expanded to include “seductions that are later regretted”. He also suggested that the movement to combat it on college campuses was motivated by animosity toward men. News of Thiel’s sizable donation set off a round of criticism, with many members of the tech industry calling for Thiel’s removal from positions of influence. Though Thiel has supported Trump’s candidacy since the summer, the billionaire did not donate any money to the campaign until 15 October, just three days after a deluge of sexual assault complaints were levied against the candidate. Thiel plans to “address the controversy” in a speech later this month, according to the New York Times. In the book,   with Thiel’s fellow Stanford and PayPal alumnus, David O Sacks, the pair discuss a 1991 case in which a    Stanford freshman alleged that she had been raped in a dorm room while intoxicated: “Although [the alleged perpetrator] was clearly guilty of serving alcohol to an underage woman and taking advantage of her resulting lack of judgement, there was no sexual assault . .. Understandably, however, the woman regretted the whole incident afterwards. ” Thiel and Sacks also took issue with Stanford’s policy on sexual assault, which said that “sexual assault by force or coercion, including deliberate coercion through use of drugs or alcohol, is absolutely unacceptable at Stanford University”. But Thiel and Sacks wrote: “It is ludicrous to believe that anyone who had been forcefully violated would not know it and bear physical marks. ” They added: “But since a multicultural rape charge may indicate nothing more than belated regret, a woman might ‘realize’ that she had been ‘raped’ the next day or even many days later. Under these circumstances, it is unclear who should be held responsible. If the alcohol made both of them do it, then why should the woman’s consent be obviated any more than the man’s? Why is all blame placed on the man?” The real victims of the movement to end sexual assault, the authors suggest, are the men:  “The purpose of the rape crisis movement seems as much about vilifying men as about raising ‘awareness’. ” The book, published in 1996, is a lengthy critique of campus culture at Stanford University, which both authors attended. The pair lambaste various institutional changes, including themed housing and support centers for racial minorities, courses in African American history and ethnic, gender and sexuality studies, the expansion of benefits to   couples, sex education for undergraduates, and other reforms they argue comprise an   “multiculturalism”.  On diversity, the pair wrote:  “Real diversity requires a diversity of ideas, not simply a bunch of   activists who resemble the bar scene from Star Wars. ” Among the authors’ complaints is the “deteriorat[ion]” of the freshman curriculum to include Nobel peace prize winner Rigoberta Menchú’s biography, I, Rigoberta Menchú, and Zora Neale Hurston’s novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God.  They took particular aim at new academic fields, such as a class studying the social movements of the 1960s or one on representations of gay and lesbian sexuality: “The passionate hatred of men, the utopian demands for an elimination of all gender differences, the (totally inconsistent) demands for a uniquely female perspective, and the belief in widespread gender discrimination are the core of the new gender studies curriculum. ” Thiel and Sacks also argue that racism is largely imaginary  —   the result of overreacting to “unintentional slight[s]”  —   and that people of colors’ insistence on talking about racism is the cause of any remaining racial tension in western society.  “As paradoxical as it may seem, the extreme focus on racism has become the source of acrimony, as multiculturalists charge whites with more evanescent and intangible forms of racism, such as ‘institutional racism’ or ‘unconscious racism’. As a result, the awareness of racism, once the main hope for ending racial division, today has become a major cause of debate and friction. ” Thiel expressed some regrets about the book in a 2011 New Yorker profile, saying that he wished he had never written about an incident in which future PayPal executive Keith Rabois stood outside the home of a university staff member and shouted, “Faggot! Faggot! Hope you die of Aids!”  —   an action intended to provoke discussion of free speech.  In the book, the widespread anger at Rabois is compared to the Salem Witch trials, George Orwell’s 1984, and the Spanish Inquisition. Thiel told the New Yorker that he now has a “much more nuanced” understanding of identity politics, including the belief that women, gays and black people have “meaningfully different” experiences.  Thiel did not address his writing on sexual assault to the New Yorker, however, and he did not respond to a query from the Guardian.

Astronomers unveil most detailed map of the Milky Way to date
Astronomers have unveiled the most detailed map to date of the Milky Way, after charting the positions of more than 1bn stars with stunning precision. The map, based on observations from the European Space Agency’s Gaia probe, still only represents about 1% of the Milky Way’s stars, but is already 20 times more complete than any previous observations of the night sky. Speaking at a briefing in London on Wednesday, Gerry Gilmore, the mission’s UK principle investigator, said that the mission was already transforming what we know about our home galaxy. “We don’t actually know what the Milky Way looks like,” he said. “It’s astonishingly difficult, when you’re inside something, to find out what it looks like. ” The robotic Gaia spacecraft, which launched in 2013, is fitted with a 1bn pixel camera  —   the largest ever in space  —   complete with more than 100 electronic detectors. The precision of the measurements is equivalent to measuring the width of your fingernail  —   but if you were in London and your finger was in Australia. The observations have already hinted at scientific discoveries that may lie ahead   including the possibility that the Milky Way may contain more stars than the current estimate of 100bn. Scientists originally calculated that Gaia would see about 1bn stars by the end of 2017, but this number has now been revised upwards. Floor van Leeuwen, of the University of Cambridge, who manages Gaia’s data processing, said: “It looks very much like we underestimated the number of stars. We think we will see  . 5bn stars. ” However, he added that it is not obvious how this relates to the number of stars in the entire galaxy. The camera has now made observations of the precise position and brightness of more than 1. 1bn stars. Astronomers are steadily converting the data into a 3D map of the galaxy   in effect, a cosmic version of Google maps. “Every mission to come will use this map,” said Gilmore, adding that it would also help direct ground telescopes towards objects of interest in the cosmos. By scanning each star about 70 times, astronomers have also calculated the sideways motion of 2m stars, showing how they drift and “wobble” in the night sky. This motion information will be crucial to building up a picture of the mass distribution in the galaxy  —   in particular the nature of the halo of dark matter that scientists believe surrounds the visible disk of the galaxy. “We don’t know how massive the dark matter halo is and we will know that very much more accurately,” said Gilmore. “Knowing the velocities of objects far out in the galaxy will help determine that. That will be a complete revolution. ” Gaia astronomers will also be able to spot which stars have planets, by observing the characteristic wobble of the star caused by the gravitational pull of its neighbouring planet. Scientists estimate that Gaia could identify around 70, 000 new    —   planets outside of our solar system  —   by the end of the mission, which would be a dramatic increase on the 3, 500 already known, most of which were identified by Nasa’s Kepler spacecraft. “For the first time, we’ll be able to look at the distribution of planets based on the position of parent stars,” said Gilmore. “That will be a huge step forward in understanding planetary formation. ” Alvaro Giménez, ESA’s Director of Science, said: “Today’s release gives us a first impression of the extraordinary data that await us and that will revolutionise our understanding of how stars are distributed and move across our galaxy. ”

Decision to deny surgery to obese patients is like ’racial discrimination’
The decision by an NHS body to restrict obese patients’ access to elective surgery until they lose weight is comparable with racial or religious discrimination, a surgeon has said. The Vale of York clinical commissioning group (CCG) will make people wait for up to a year for treatment for    conditions such as hip and knee replacements if their body mass index is 30 or higher. The group said it had taken the decision because it was the “best way of achieving maximum value from the limited resources available”. Shaw Somers, a bariatric surgeon from Portsmouth, said the move was a logical step and could save money, but amounted to discrimination because obesity was an illness. “They [the patients] are trying to lose weight in the vast majority of cases and to deny them treatment that they need on the basis of their weight, without then offering them effective help to help them lose weight is rather like discriminating [against] a segment of the population on the basis of their colour or religious persuasion,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “Just saying you can’t have surgery and there is no access to alternative treatments really doesn’t help anyone. ” Chris Hopson, the head of NHS Providers  —   which represents acute care, ambulance and community services  —   said the move amounted to “rationing care to save money”.  He told Today that the health service was being asked to deliver too much for the funding available. Rather than commissioning groups making “piecemeal decisions” Hopson said there should be a national debate about the future of the UK’s healthcare system involving not only politicians, NHS leaders and clinicians  —   but the public as well, given that tax revenues funded it. Demand for healthcare was “about to go through the roof” as baby boomers neared the end of their lives, he said. There had been a 6% increase in emergency admissions in the first quarter of this year. The Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) said that it was a dangerous move that ranked among the “most severe the modern NHS has ever seen”. Its president, Clare Marx, said that while the RCS supported helping people to lose weight and stop smoking, “introducing blanket bans that delay patients’ access to what can be   surgery for up to a year is wrong”. She added: “As the true scale of financial pressure on NHS trusts has become clear over the summer, we are fast finding ourselves in a situation where CCGs are introducing draconian commissioning policies, often flouting Nice [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence] or other clinical guidance, in order to balance the books. “An honest national debate on exactly what the NHS can afford, and what we are willing to pay, is urgently needed. ” The Vale of York is one of nine clinical commissioning groups in England that face acute financial problems and have been forced into special measures. Five hospital trusts are also expected to overshoot their budgets by a wide margin this year. There are fears that more parts of the NHS could start to impose similar restrictions on elective care in an attempt to balance the books. The health service had record overspending of £2. 45bn in 2015, but NHS bosses hope that cuts will bring the figure down to nearer £250m by the end of this year. The Vale of York group said: “The local system is under severe pressure. This work will help to ensure that we get the very best value from the NHS and not exceed our resources or risk the ability of the NHS being there when people really need it. ” Policy documents produced by bosses in the North Yorkshire authority make clear that adult smokers will have elective surgery postponed “for six months or until they’ve stopped smoking for eight weeks”. And, for people whose BMI is 30 or more  —   who are defined as obese  —   such treatment will be put back a year “or until 10% of weight loss is achieved, whichever is the sooner”. The CCG added that, in either case, “patients undergoing surgery for cancer will not be affected” and its clinicians would “identify other groups of patients who should be exceptions to the policy”. In March last year, it was reported that the vast majority of NHS authorities were placing restrictions on access to surgery for overweight people, including one CCG that was refusing all routine surgery to people whose BMI was 35 or greater  —   those defined as morbidly obese. The investigation by GP magazine also found that most of England’s CCGs were denying some treatments to smokers. A spokesman for NHS England said: “Major surgery poses much higher risks for severely overweight patients who smoke. So local   clinical commissioning groups are entirely right to ensure these patients first get support to lose weight and try and stop smoking before their hip or knee operation. Reducing obesity and cutting smoking not only benefits patients but saves the NHS and taxpayers millions of pounds. “This does not and cannot mean blanket bans on particular patients such as smokers getting operations, which would be inconsistent with the NHS constitution.  “Vale of York CCG is currently under special measures legal direction, and NHS England is today asking it to review its proposed approach before it takes effect to ensure it is proportionate, clinically reasonable, and consistent with applicable national clinical guidelines. ”

Fidel Castro worked on Gabriel García Márquez’s manuscripts
Feted as a revolutionary hero and demonised as an enemy of the free world, Fidel Castro also played an unexpected role in global literature. The Cuban president, who died on 25 November, acted as unofficial copy editor for the acclaimed novelist Gabriel García Márquez, providing    corrections for the writer after the two struck up a close friendship in the late 1970s. Dr Stéphanie   lecturer in Latin American studies at Aston University, told the Guardian: “The president was an avid reader. When they met in 1977, they had several conversations about literature and eventually Fidel offered to read his manuscripts, because he had a good eye for detail. ”  The Colombian Nobel laureate, who died in 2014, was a supporter of the Cuban revolution, support he never relinquished despite Castro’s record of human rights abuses.   who   a book about their relationship titled Fidel  Gabo in 2009, said the writer would send completed manuscripts to Havana before submitting them to his publisher. Castro’s corrections were factual and grammatical rather than ideological, she added. “After reading his book The Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor, Fidel had told Gabo there was a mistake in the calculation of the speed of the boat. This led Gabo to ask him to read his manuscripts   …     Another example of a correction he made later on was in Chronicle of a Death Foretold, where Fidel pointed out an error in the specifications of a hunting rifle. ” Elsewhere, Castro offered advice about the compatibility of bullets with guns used by García Márquez’s characters. The two met in a Cuban hotel in 1977. Though the meeting has been described as coincidental,   said Castro may have orchestrated it after he heard the Colombian writer was working on a nonfiction book about life in Cuba under the US embargo, using testimonies from ordinary Cubans. The book never appeared. A sign of the closeness of the two men is revealed in a book among García Márquez’s personal library acquired by the Harry Ransom Centre at the University of Texas this week. A note to García Márquez written by Castro in the front of La Victoria Estratégica is addressed to Gabo, the affectionate nickname used by South Americans for the writer. Castro wrote the note in 2010, taking time out from work alleviating the devastation of the Haiti earthquake. “Your book Yo No Vengo a Decir un Discurso [I’m Not Here to Give a Speech] is disturbing,” he sold his friend. “Enslaved by other obligations, I abandoned my duty and started reading. I missed your stories. ” The plague in Haiti, he added, “reminded me of Love in a Time of Cholera”. García Márquez inspired more than one global leader, as shown by the range of books acquired by the Harry Ransom Centre. A Spanish copy of Bill Clinton’s memoir My Life is inscribed: “To my friend Gabriel García Márquez, with thanks for your life, your inspiration and your kindness. ” The novelist is known to have discussed Cuba with the former US president and Dr   said a number of dissidents were released as a result of his intervention. Although García Márquez accepted editorial advice from Castro, it is not known whether he attempted a similar service in return. In an 1978 interview, he said that he would criticise the Cuban president to his face in private but never in public. Anna Hervé, a publishing editorial manager, said the success of García Márquez and Castro’s collaboration was rare. “Most great artists define themselves in opposition to the elite in the modern era. And dictators have notoriously poor taste, as a rule. ”

Ricky Harris, Heat actor and comedian, dies aged 54
The actor and comedian Ricky Harris, who made a name for himself as a standup comedian in the 90s and onscreen in films such as Michael Mann’s heist classic Heat, has died aged 54. The star’s manager confirmed his death on Monday and peers of the performer, including Snoop Dogg and Cedric the Entertainer, paid tribute to him on social media. The cause of his death has not been confirmed, but his manager told the Los Angeles Times that he suffered a heart attack two years ago. Harris was from Long Beach, California, and was a close friend of Snoop Dogg, featuring on his albums, on which he performed skits. Snoop Dogg said: “I lost one of my dear friends today. [He] was the first comedian to make it from Long Beach, the first entertainer from Long Beach to make it. My big brother. ” Harris was a regular on the Russell   Def Comedy Jam, with the likes of Chris Rock and Chris Tucker, who led the new generation of African American comics that emerged in the 90s. Harris’s acting career began with Poetic Justice in 1993, in which he starred alongside Tupac Shakur and Janet Jackson, and two years later he appeared in Heat with Al Pacino.  Harris also had roles on the small screen, appearing on Everybody Hates Chris and Moesha, and last year he made an appearance in the Sundance favourite Dope. The contemporary funk artist Dam Funk wrote about Harris’s   musical past on his Instagram page. Funk said he used to play drums for Harris’s band, which he would use on comedy nights, and said Harris also appeared in a   group called the Dove Shack and another group called the Ghetto Clownz.

Facebook had no right to edit history
It was an ordinary,   flight from Oslo to Trondheim that I spent preparing for a speech I was to give upon landing. But when I turned my phone back on upon arrival, I noticed something very odd, something that had in fact never happened before. A post had been deleted from my Facebook page without any warning. I had shared one of the most iconic images from the Vietnam war  —   Nick Ut’s photograph of a naked, screaming child running away from napalm bombs, as a statement in the ongoing debate about Facebook’s editing policies. Facebook has taken a strong, rigid stance against “indecent” images. And it is commendable that they execute their role in the prevention of the distribution of images containing violence and child abuse seriously. We all have a responsibility towards this. Yet, by failing to distinguish between such images, and others that have formed the fabric of our history as a global society, Facebook neglects another important role that it plays on the world stage. To erase posts containing such images is to limit freedom of expression, democracy, the right to criticize and question, and view past events as they actually were, not as they have been deemed to be by one giant corporation. I am happy to note that Facebook has now decided to reverse that policy in this particular case  —   but serious questions remain.  Media consumption today is increasingly digitized, but even more so it is curated. News and social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Flipboard have overtaken traditional news outlets as our primary sources of information, of news, of connection to the world around us. They have become our most frequently visited sites, especially among the younger generations, and have empowered the public to create and share their own content. With this ease of access to information in today’s world, comes a great responsibility to enact policies that make positive contributions to society. By exercising such overarching editorial rights, large corporations that ought to bring us closer together as human beings through transparency, end up altering history, and altering the truth. Already, Facebook and other media outlets’ algorithms narrow the range of content one sees based on past preferences and interests. This limits the kind of stories one sees, and in turn restricts access to a holistic outlook for the user. We run the risk of creating parallel societies in which some people are not aware of the real issues facing the world, and this is only exacerbated by such editorial oversight. As we move towards a more automated world, this is not a responsibility that should be surrendered to machines only. By deleting such iconic pictures that have played a crucial role in transforming world views on the pain and cruelty of war, Facebook is contributing to changing history. I want my children, and other children around the world, to grow up in a society where history is told as it was. In a society where they can grow into mature adults by learning from experiences of past generations, to be better informed citizens of the world. They need to understand what happened both in our darkest moments and our brightest. Today, images are the most powerful and important means of communication, and they must depict reality. It would be tragic for history, for the truth, to be told in the version that comes from any one corporation’s mouthpiece. This is why I believe it is imperative that such outlets take their responsibility seriously, while exercising such great influence over their users’ access to information. We have today shown that through the power of social media, we can influence social media. Let’s continue to do that. It is after all a platform for and made by the people, where you can’t let machines run your morality.

Facing my fear: I was scared of being laughed out of the gym
Did I ever tell you that Frank Thomas was in my high school physical education class? Yes, that Frank Thomas, the major league first baseman known as “The Big Hurt”. Every time we’d play baseball in fourth period and Frank would come up to bat, everybody in the outfield would start walking backwards, because when Frank hit the ball, it was always going over the fence and into the parking lot of the housing projects next to the school. At 14, of course, none of us had any idea that we were sharing the diamond with a future Chicago White Sox player. And I  —   freshly out of the closet, not athletic, typically five to 10 minutes late changing for gym class because it took so long to take off all my bracelets and other jewelry  —   just thought that I must be a washout athletically, uncoordinated, effete and pale as milk. Other boys  —   although I should note that Frank never joined in the bullying  —   were ruthless with me, calling me names, chucking basketballs and volleyballs at my head and face, tripping me or punching me when the coach turned his back. And don’t think I didn’t notice that the coach seemed to turn his back an awful lot where I was concerned.  The bullying I got from other boys combined with the humiliations of fourth period PE made me wildly averse to going anywhere that had that “gym smell” for decades afterwards. To me, it smelled like trauma and humiliation. Then I turned 40 and my metabolism began to slow down. My waistline began to expand, my once     hipbones vanished into the mush, my face was getting doughy, and I found myself getting winded by routine tasks like climbing the stairs in the parking garage to get to my car at the end of the workday. I knew I needed to get some kind of fitness program in my life, but I was still terrified of going to the gym. What if I was terrible at it? What if people pointed and laughed? What if the deadlifting bros were homophobes who corner me in the locker room for some kind of public shaming? How would I handle that? I soon found out. My first go at introducing physical activity into my life was swimming, inspired by watching Michael Phelps compete in the 2008 Olympics. I remember seeing him on his starting block and thinking, “I don’t need for my body to look like that, but I just want to feel strong. ” I bought a day pass to the nearby university pool and decided to swim some laps. In a pair of Old Navy board shorts I lowered myself into the heavily chlorinated water and started to do a kind of modified   because I’d forgotten my goggles. After about 20 minutes, I got that unmistakable sinking feeling that comes from hearing someone laugh and realizing that they’re laughing at you. A pair of young women were floating in the next swim lane, laughing and pointing at my awkward progress through the water. I swam a couple more laps, noting that a face burning with embarrassment can still be felt underwater. I wrote a short speech in my head and when I drew abreast of them, I said, “I can hear you, you know. I may swim funny, but I’m not deaf. You’re rude, horrible people and I would like to remind you that you won’t be young and beautiful forever. ” They rolled their eyes at me and went back to minding their own business, but I realized that the Worst Possible Thing had just happened. People made fun of me. It was embarrassing, but it wasn’t fatal. That Monday, I bought a gym membership, signed up for sessions with a personal trainer and decided to go for it. To my surprise, not everybody at the gym was a ’  bodybuilder or a hardcore Crossfitter. And there was a surprising lack of judgment from fellow  . It turns out that the rule of the gym is a lot like the rule of the dance floor. If you’re paying more attention to how someone else is doing it than how you’re doing it, you’re doing it wrong. And that whole thing I was feeling about being called out as gay in the locker room and shamed? I had nothing to fear there: it turns out everybody’s a little gay in the men’s locker room.  Men check each other out. I remember telling my trainer that I felt bad for straight men who don’t get to end their workout with their own locker room equivalent, hanging out in a room full of naked women. “That’s like dinner with no dessert,” I told him, “I never thought of that, but you’re right. It’s totally unfair,” he said. So now the gym doesn’t scare me I have just as much of a right to be there as anyone else does. I still don’t look like Michael Phelps, and I’m pretty sure that I will never get back into my   waist rock star jeans. But I’m happy with my body, on the whole. It’s serving me pretty well, and I’ve learned to not compare my fitness level and athletic prowess with Major League baseball players. We all do the best we can with what we have. And for me, that’s good enough.

Our gun debate is topsy-turvy. Like quitting donuts to stop lung cancer
Imagine a chainsmoker comes in to see you who has lung cancer. You tell him to stop smoking, and he starts bargaining. He’s willing to give up donuts. You say donuts don’t cause lung cancer, so he offers to stop watching Game of Thrones. What’s clear is that he doesn’t intend to stop smoking, and he doesn’t want to hear about any correlation to lung cancer. That’s about where this country is on gun violence.  It’s weird that the   gesture of a   is now being used to support gun action that apparently includes the   list. The list, as a brown friend pointed out to me, is a list of mostly brown people, who got on for various reasons, some of them dubious at best, or wildly unfair and have no path to clearing their name and getting off.  Sloppily enforced, the list apparently also targets people who have the same name as people on the watch list. Senator Ted Kennedy was treated as a   suspect at one point so have small children and lots of peaceable people. But we have mass shootings all the time, and they’re mostly by citizens who’ll never get anywhere near a list like that. So this    legislation is a bandaid nowhere near the wound that matters. What we see over and over is that this society would like to imagine our epidemic of violence is by “them”  —   some kind of marginal category: terrorist, mentally ill, nonwhite. But when it comes to mass killings, mostly it’s an epidemic of “us”  —  mainstream men, mostly white, often young, usually miserable.  In the wake of the murder of 49 people in Orlando, people have addressed the strong correlation between domestic violence and mass shootings. According to Everytown for Gun Safety: “More than half of women murdered with guns in the U. S. in 2011  —   at least 53%  —   were killed by intimate partners or family members . .. This is also true for mass shootings: in 57% of the mass shootings between January 2009 and June 2014, the perpetrator killed an intimate partner or family member”.  With that in mind, we could just get serious about enforcing the 1996 Lauterberg Law that allows firearms to be taken away from those convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors and prohibits them from purchasing and owning guns. It’s rarely actually used to require convicted abusers to surrender their guns, but it could be.  Lack of background checks also allows people who should not be allowed to buy guns to buy them. Fully enforcing that law nationwide would take away a whole lot of guns from people who are not good at   and respect and who are, as I said in the Guardian just before the Orlando massacre, the significant terrorists at large in this country. You can tell they’re terrorists because there are a lot of people, mostly women and children, who live in terror because of them.      legislation would not have prohibited the Orlando shooter from buying guns. He wasn’t on it. But if we had adequate domestic violence services in this country, perhaps his first wife would have contacted the authorities, rather than just being whisked away by her family. And if he had been convicted of domestic violence, as he should have been, and we had enforced the existing federal Lautenberg law in every state, with background checks in place, then he would’ve been denied guns and employment as an armed guard.  It’s too late for that now, but not to enforce the law on the books that might prevent a lot more deaths down the road.  Beyond that, we could recognize that we have a unique kind of violence in the United States. The omnipresence of guns has something to do with it, and so does what people are now calling hypermasculinity or toxic masculinity. But there’s also some warped idea of individualism and   at work in the   shooting sprees.  In most countries around the world, people either kill someone they’re personally furious at or kill for political and economic reasons. The people they kill are killed for reasons that are coherent even if they’re reprehensible.  Many of our mass shootings are something else altogether: some miserable guy who finds personal relationships hard and his own psyche a mystery and a torment goes out and kills a bunch of strangers in a movie theater or a school or a workplace as a form of creative   general punishment or a desire to go out in a blaze of glory.  If the casualties are high enough, he’ll have his week or two of celebrity, thanks to the eagerness of the media to show and tell us everything about him. These days shootings involving three or four or five victims are hardly news unless the circumstances are spectacular, though. That’s why there was so little news about the man who allegedly shot his wife and four daughters in New Mexico the day before the Orlando bloodbath allegedly his wife had asked for a divorce. The desire to be free of abuse is often what triggers its fatal escalation. Mental illness is a factor in some  —   the shooter who killed six people and gravely injured Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in 2011 was said to be a paranoid schizophrenic, though he was also a supporter of   ideologies and also seemed to hate women, especially women in power like Giffords.  In many cases, including his, mental illness seems more a factor in disinhibiting people than in directing them the directions come from the outside culture. There’s plenty of mental illness around the world, and it doesn’t lead to mass murders the way it does here. (Mental illness was cited as a factor in the 2014 Isla Vista mass shooting, and it led to a California law that went into effect this year that allows temporary restraining orders preventing mentally ill people from buying and owning guns.) Some cases are apparently fueled by racism, like Dylan Roof’s Charleston church massacre a year ago appeared to be.  In the case in Orlando, homophobia seems like a more compelling motive than Islam, and we might want to remember that the conservative mainstream has been, of late, in a frenzy of demonizing gay and lesbian and trans people, treating them as threats and outsiders and enemies.  The lesson is that a lot of the United States’s mass killers are just angry men. It’s not   ideologues it’s our very own armed and angry men. It’s not them its us. We know everything we need to about the epidemic of violence in this country, except how to overcome the opposition to diagnosing it accurately and treating it effectively. You don’t pretend it’s not lung cancer, unless you want to have a good excuse to not give up the cigarettes that are killing you. Donuts don’t cause lung cancer. They never have and they never will. We all know that  —   some of us just don’t want to admit it.

The moment my marriage was over: ’I had no idea I was living with a drug dealer’
In this new series, anonymous writers share the most painful moment of their marriage: the moment they knew their relationship was over, We were paired by her best friend. I was exceedingly naive, and though no virgin, was blindsided by my first taste of serial sex. We lived together for a year while I completed a bachelor’s degree in 20th century drama and she worked as a legal secretary. She had tried university herself for a semester at the urging of girlfriends but quickly discovered that further time in a classroom held no interest.  She was the pampered daughter of divorced parents. She had a fancy new car and liked to party. I, on the other hand, was tenuously holding the military draft at bay by maintaining a student deferment in grad school during the day. Nights I tended bar for food and rent money. To simplify practical matters of daily life, we decided to marry. It had to be in a Catholic church, even though she was not Catholic and I could barely comprehend religion. She wanted “ceremony” so we had that, with classical musician friends accompanying the mass, and a loud organ soundtrack. We invited no actual family to attend. There was a brief and anticlimactic   party in the kitchen of the apartment we shared with another couple, and emphasizing the importance of the event, the next morning the bride flew off northwards for a   visit with her mother. I went to a Jimi Hendrix concert with my buddy Red.  She arrived back the afternoon of the very next day, 48 hours after we were married, to the telephone ringing. Her mother had died of an overdose, on pills that her daughter had just presented as a gift.  Our marriage was over the moment she hung up the phone. ••• I had not paid attention to what was happening around me. I knew my partner had been prescribed daily amphetamine capsules by her doctor to “help her lose weight”. But I did not realize that she was also dosing herself with the barbiturate Seconal to help her sleep every night. Her doctor was also willing to give her multiple simultaneous prescriptions, and beneath my radar she had become something of a distributor.  I can only excuse myself by whining that I was in grad school, worrying about a looming term of imprisonment in the army, and wearing blinders as only an overly   and   fool can.  I had no idea I was living with a completely    drug dealer. I stayed at her side to support her through the funeral, but when we got back to the apartment, I gathered a single small bag of clothing, stuck out my thumb, and bummed a ride westward. I moved into a different university community and quickly   in graduate school but had drawn an incredibly low draft number. My academic career was terminated by the government. I was finally and forcibly conscripted as a draftee into the US army, sent overseas, served my time as a clerk, and was not killed.  When I returned stateside, I almost wished I had been. Credit cards in my name had been issued and maxed out by my   spouse, and subsequently creditors had been hounding my parents for money. The spouse had disappeared upon my arrival.  It took two years to pay off my ex’s debts.  Three years later I was brought from a deep sleep at daybreak on my birthday by insistent banging on my door. The gentleman saw the look on my face and smiled. He was a paid courier and held out a paper packet, legally serving me with what unfolded to be a divorce decree. And then he handed me an accompanying fifth of bourbon. Birthday present from the divorcee. The termination was official.  As I had a sunrise pull from my liquid gift, I speculated that the woman had really found a change in heart, that maybe she was not as terminally corrupt as I had thought.  A day later, I found out that her father had died and left her a vast amount of money, land and valuable investments. The first thing she had used the cash for was to hire a lawyer and legally get rid of me, so I would have no claim on her new wealth. I didn’t care about the marriage, or its end. But the bourbon came in handy.

Russian MP hopes ‘our beloved Mr Trump’ will end doping investigation
If international sport officials were expecting an apology from Russia after the latest findings of its   doping at the London Olympics and other events, they were disappointed. Continuing a line of argument that began after the first allegations of Russian widespread performance enhancing drug use in 2014, officials in Moscow dismissed the accusations and said the report was politicised. One MP even called on the US   Donald Trump, who has spoken favourably of Russia, to stop the investigations. The World   Agency report by the Canadian law professor Richard McLaren found that more than 1, 000 Russian athletes, including competitors at the London and Sochi Olympics, benefited from   doping between 2011 and 2015. “The sport ministry with all conviction can declare the absence of government programmes to support doping in sport,” the Russian ministry said in a statement. “The sport ministry is continuing the battle with doping from a position of zero tolerance. ” Mikhail Degtaryov, head of the sport committee in parliament, called the report biased and questioned why it hadn’t investigated other countries. “There was an order to attack our athletes. It was carried out in great detail,” Degtaryov said. “Then let’s investigate the US, British and Canadian teams. I think a lot of interesting things would be presented to the world if investigations were conducted. ” The MP Igor Lebedev told   that he was hoping Trump, who has praised Putin and talked of cooperating with Russia, would end the doping investigations. “It was expected that there wouldn’t be any evidence, there would be yet another stream of falsehoods, groundless accusations,” Lebedev said. “All this has a strong political undertone and we and all Russians hope that our beloved Mr Trump will put an end to this. ” Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the state news agency RIA Novosti that the Kremlin was still studying the findings. State media coverage painted the McLaren report as biased. Match TV host Alexei Popov described it as “bullying” and an attack on Russian athletes. At a roundtable of former athletes and officials, only Alexander Tikhonov, a   gold medallist in biathlon, suggested Russia could be guilty, accusing the former president Dmitry Medvedev of not taking action on a 2010 warning from the International Olympic Committee about doping. “Instead of taking concrete measures, we didn’t do almost anything for 20 years,” he said. But many officials suggested the findings were  . The wrestling federation head, Mikhail Mamiashvili, called the report a “maniacal attempt going on to prove something that doesn’t exist”. The luge federation president, Natalia Gart, said: “All these accusations aren’t based on any evidence. ” A cartoon published by RIA Novosti captured the overall mood: it depicted McLaren menacingly waving his hands as he depicts a Russian intelligence agent descending on cables, Mission:   into a room full of urine samples. The MP Dmitry Svishchev, a member of the sport committee, said: “I think the report has smashed to pieces all the logic and theory of a universal doping conspiracy in Russia and government support for doping. There aren’t any facts. ” The double Olympic gold   pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva, who emerged as an unofficial spokeswoman for Russian athletics when the team was banned from the Rio de Janeiro Olympics this summer, said Russia must win back the trust of the international community and rebuild its   agency, while also criticising the report. “It’s easy to accuse if you generalise and put everyone in one mass,” she told Match TV. “But if we ask for concrete evidence against specific athletes, I doubt that they will give it to us. ” A key concern remains the 2018 World Cup in Russia, as many officials have called the doping investigations an attempt to move the event. The former Olympic judoka Dmitry Nosov said: “The main task for every citizen and especially sports officials is to not allow them to take away our World Cup, as well as the [2019] Winter Universiade in Krasnoyarsk. This report is another step against this event. ” In separate comments, the former Russian Olympic Committee head Leonid Tyagachyov warned the findings could create “problems with our participation in the Olympics in PyeongChang” the South Korean venue for the 2018 Winter Games.

The Guardian view on climate change action: don’t delay
Temperatures in the Arctic in the last two months have hit more than 20C above normal for the time of year. Temperatures that unusual in the UK and Europe would produce 45C summers. As a result, sea ice has shrunk to levels that scientists describe as “off the scale”. Mapping the changes to the extent of sea ice over the last 40 years confirms that: on a graph, the lines are clustered together like threads in a hank of silk, warming and cooling in line with each other  —   until this year. This year’s line drops down like a thin thread dangling into the void. Extrapolating data from a single year must be done with caution. When El Niño boosted global temperatures to make 1998 the hottest year on record, a position it held until 2014, deniers claimed that this showed that global warming had “paused”. In fact, several years after 1998 came within 0. 3C of the record. The rise of a huge 20C over normal in the Arctic, the region that acts as one of the most important regulators in the global climate system, means that all expectations must now be rewritten. Arctic snow and ice reflect heat back into space  —   the albedo effect. When there is less ice, less sunlight is reflected and the sea, newly exposed, absorbs more heat, which melts more ice, and so on in a cycle. This is of vital importance: it could represent a tipping point, beyond which the Arctic ice cap, by some projections, might soon disappear altogether in summer. This is not the only crucial climate role the Arctic plays. Sea and air currents swirling over and under the ice cool the globe and affect weather systems on the other side of the world, sometimes in ways that are still not fully understood. Arctic sea ice has recovered in extent from previous lows. But that does not tell the whole story. When temperatures are less volatile, sea ice forms in layers over multiple years to a thick and solid mass. Ice that forms under this year’s conditions is likely to be thinner and less stable than what it replaces, more vulnerable to another year’s warming and less effective as a temperature regulator. For these reasons, the current drastic melting of the Arctic cannot be regarded merely as an outlier. While the effects of an   Arctic on global weather systems are still in the realm of known unknowns, it is a known known that they will be disruptive. The current Arctic temperature and sea ice charts look like the beginning of a whole new trend, one that could change the global climate system for ever. The imperative for action is therefore overwhelming. Reducing carbon dioxide is vital, and it is encouraging that annual emissions have been flat for three years. But now it is necessary to move further, faster. Some experts advocate cutting the amount of black, unburnt carbon  —   soot  —   as a matter of urgency. Much of this soot is borne by air currents to the Arctic, depositing it on pristine snow that turns black, and so more  . Some measures to stop soot, like capping   power stations and banning agricultural burning, are relatively easy. Others  —   cleaner vehicles and spreading the use of solar cookers in developing countries  —   might take longer. Getting rid of potent hydrofluorocarbon gases, commonly used in refrigeration, has the broad backing of governments and industry, and will buy time. Methane, often a byproduct of fossil fuel exploration, should be used as an energy source, or at least flared, which is less harmful. Cutting these “  climate pollutants” could prevent 0. 5C of warming over the next 30 years, the research suggests. These are opportunities that must be taken they are necessary, though not sufficient. So governments should also convene an Arctic council to explore other ways of protecting the region. Driving progress demands just the kind of leadership that looks very much to have disappeared from the global scene. Vladimir Putin’s Russia has been laying claim to vast Arctic areas, anticipating the realms of new possibility for commerce  —   new shipping lanes, cutting thousands of miles from current journeys  —   as well as oil and gas exploration that an   Arctic would open up. For Donald Trump, such an unfrozen Arctic might allow the US to control key shipping routes, and find new oilfields and gas fields. Mr Trump’s choice of Rex Tillerson, former head of Exxon Mobil and cheerleader for Mr Putin, as secretary of state is deeply worrying. Two friendly world leaders facing one an other across a vanishing Arctic ice cap. The thawing of the cold war is no longer a metaphor.

’Awkward moment’ for Prince Harry in minute’s silence for Fidel Castro
Prince Harry has taken part in observing a minute’s silence in remembrance of Fidel Castro. The potentially embarrassing episode took place during a trip to the Caribbean island of St Vincent. The prince joined local dignitaries at a reception in the capital, Kingstown, hosted by the Caribbean country’s governor general, Sir Frederick Ballantyne. News of Castro’s death at the age of 90 broke on Friday and the following day Harry, who is on a   tour of the Caribbean, was among those to bow his head when Ballantyne asked his guests to mark the death of the Cuban revolutionary leader. Among them was the prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines and leader of the country’s ruling Unity Labour party, Dr Ralph Gonsalves, who described Castro as a good friend of his country. The incident prompted criticism from Conservative MPs, who said it was unfair that Prince Harry had been put in such a position. Alec Shelbrooke said the British government should make clear it was unacceptable. He told the Mail: “Castro was a murderous dictator. He is dead, and good riddance. This endless stream of people excusing him, especially Labour MPs like Jeremy Corbyn, is ridiculous. It is very unfair to put pressure on members of the royal family to take part in this kind of tribute. ” His Conservative colleague Michael Fabricant told the paper: “I am no fan of Fidel Castro, who was more of a tyrant than an enlightened leader. But I am a fan of Prince Harry. It must have been an awkward moment for him but hey, what else could he do?” Castro has been a divisive figure on the world stage, coming in for heavy criticism for his regime’s repression of political opposition after it took control in Cuba in 1959, as well as the many deaths of those it deemed a danger to it. But some world leaders praised Castro after his death for the way he led his country and stood staunchly opposed to Washington throughout his life. Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, said: “To all the revolutionaries of the world, we have to continue his legacy and his flag of independence, of socialism, of homeland. ” Rafael Correa, the president of Ecuador, said: “He was a great one. Fidel is dead. Long live Cuba! Long live Latin America!” Kensington Palace declined to comment.

MIA accuses VMAs of ’racism, sexism, classism, elitism’
MIA has accused the MTV Video Music Awards of “racism, sexism, classism, elitism” after the video for her single Borders was not included on this year’s nominee list.  The   video makes a statement on the refugee crisis, portraying groups of men packed on flotilla boats, while others scale vast border fences topped with barbed wire.  The VMA shortlist, announced earlier this week, is dominated by Beyoncé’s Lemonade, an artist MIA condemned this year for not being vocal about issues beyond Black Lives Matter. “Is Beyoncé or Kendrick Lamar going to say Muslim Lives Matter? Or Syrian Lives Matter? Or this kid in Pakistan matters?” she told the Evening Standard in April. Posting a series of messages on Twitter today, the Sri Lankan rapper writes: Her reference to “allowed’ voice v excluded voices” alludes to MIA’s original comments surrounding the Black Lives Matter movement, which eventually led to her being dropped from the bill of London’s Afropunk festival.  “After discussing the situation with the artist and the community, a decision was agreed upon by all involved that MIA will no longer headline Afropunk London,” a statement from the festival read last week, after ticketholders threatened to boycott the event. “A key part of the Afropunk ethos has always been educating one another, breaking down boundaries and sparking conversation about race, gender, religion, sex, culture and everything that makes life worth living. ”

Vladimir Putin warns of Olympic ‘schism’ after Russian doping revealed
The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has warned that the Olympic movement could “wind up on the edge of schism” after a damning report found that the country’s government, security services and sporting authorities colluded to hide widespread doping across “a vast majority” of winter and summer sports. The International Olympic Committee, whose executive board will discuss the fallout from the report by the Canadian law professor Richard McLaren on Tuesday, has promised it will not hesitate to take the “toughest sanctions available” against those implicated. The IOC president, Thomas Bach, called it “a shocking and unprecedented attack on the integrity of sports and on the Olympic Games”. In light of McLaren’s report the World   Agency has urged the IOC to consider banning Russia from the Olympics altogether while also suggesting Russia’s government officials should be denied access to Rio 2016. Wada does not have the authority directly to ban a country from the Olympics but can recommend sanctions to the IOC. Putin has doubted the validity of the findings, however, questioning the integrity of the whistleblower Dr Grigor Rodchenko  —   who worked as head of   for the Moscow laboratory between 2005 and 2015  —   and dismissing the demands for Russia to be thrown out of the Olympics as politically motivated. In a statement Putin warned: “Now we’re observing a dangerous relapse into the interference of politics in sport. Yes, the form of that interference has changed but the essence is the same, to make sport an instrument of geopolitical pressure and the formation of a negative image of countries and peoples. The Olympic movement, which plays a colossal unifying role for humanity, could again wind up on the edge of schism. ” Putin also criticised the United States   Agency, which has called for Russia to be banned from Rio. “What is behind such haste?” he asked. “An attempt to create certain media coverage, to apply pressure? The impression is forming that the Usada experts at the very least had access to the unpublished report and maybe themselves determined its tone and contents. In that case a national structure of one government is again dictating its will to the whole international athletic community. ” However, Travis Tygart, the Usada chief executive, said: “The McLaren Report has concluded, beyond a reasonable doubt, a   level of corruption within both Russian sport and government that goes right to the field of play. Most importantly our hearts go out to athletes from all over the world who were robbed of their Olympic dreams. We must come together as an international community  —   comprised of those who truly believe in the spirit of Olympism  —   to ensure this unprecedented level of criminality never again threatens the sports we cherish. ” McLaren admitted that his report, which had taken 57 days to produce, was a “thin slice” of what might be out there  —   yet its details were still hugely damaging for Russia. The central finding was that hundreds of Russian athletes across 30 sports had benefited from what he called “the Disappearing Positive Methodology” which had become state policy after the country’s poor medal count during the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver. As the report notes, under this new system which came into effect in late 2011 all doping positives found by the Moscow laboratory were reported to the Russian deputy minister for sport along with the athlete’s name. The order would then come back to either “save” the sample  —   report it as negative in Wada’s anti‑doping management system, allowing the athlete to continue to compete while dirty  —   or “quarantine” it, meaning it would be processed normally. According to McLaren, the Russian ministry of sport made save or quarantine orders on 577 athlete profiles. That included 139 from athletics, more than 100 weightlifters, nearly 40 in Paralympic sport and more than 20 in wrestling, canoeing, cycling and swimming. Athletes were also given a cocktail of three steroids  —   known as the ‘Duchess’ after a traditional Russian drink  —   which was dissolved in alcohol (Chivas for the men and Vermouth for the women) and swished around the mouth and then spat out. The report found that all organs of the state were involved, including the Russian sports ministry, the FSB security service and the Centre of Sports Preparation of National Teams of Russia. According to McLaren, a key figure was Yuri Nagornykh, the deputy sport minister who was appointed in 2010 by executive order of Putin, then the prime minister. Nagornykh, a Russian Olympic Committee member, was advised of every positive analytical finding arising in the Moscow laboratory from 2011 onwards  —   and “decided who would benefit from a   and who would not be protected”. McLaren also confirmed the allegations made by Rodchenkov that   urine samples were substituted with clean ones in Sochi by passing them through “a mouse hole”. Once the samples were passed through the hole, they were given to Evgeny Blokhin, an FSB agent who had a security clearance to enter the laboratory under the guise of being a sewer engineer, and then switched. As McLaren put it: “This is a slice of what is going on, not the total picture. But this included most of the winter and summer sports. And we do know that every single positive was sent up the chain of command and sent back down again. ” McLaren added he was “supremely confident in our findings” insisting that he had only considered evidence “that is beyond reasonable doubt”. Adam Pengilly, a former British skeleton racer and now a member of the IOC athletes’ commission, said: “By not accepting the recommendations from Wada we risk very much damaging the credibility of the movement and all of sport. ” Ben Sandford, a New Zealand skeleton racer who is on Wada’s athletes’ commission, said the number of Russian athletes involved was remarkable. “I think Russia should be totally banned from the Olympics and Paralympics. The Russians have to look at themselves  —   they created this programme, they have to live with the consequences. ” Last month the International Association of Athletics Federations banned Russia’s track and field stars from the Rio Games. The results of an appeal to the court of arbitration for sport in Lausanne will be revealed on Thursday.

Donald Trump shut down companies tied to Saudi Arabia after election
  Donald Trump shut down some of his companies in the days after the election, including four that appeared connected to a possible Saudi Arabia business venture, according to corporate registrations in Delaware. News of the move came days before Trump is expected to describe changes he is making to his businesses to avoid potential conflicts of interest as the US president. The Trump Organization’s general counsel, Alan Garten, described shutting down the four companies as routine “housecleaning” and said there was no existing Trump business venture in Saudi Arabia. The four   companies were among at least nine companies that Trump filed paperwork to dissolve or cancel since questions were raised after the election about how he would conduct business while in the White House. Trump operates branded hotels and resorts in a handful of countries around the world, though he and his executives had talked about expanding more globally. Last year, Ivanka Trump singled out the Middle East and Saudi Arabia as potential locations. “Dubai is a top priority city for us. We are looking at multiple opportunities in Abu Dhabi, in Qatar, in Saudi Arabia, so those are the four areas where we are seeing the most interest,” Ivanka Trump told the publication Hotelier Middle East in May 2015 while attending the Arabian Hotel Investment Conference. “We haven’t made a final decision in any of the markets, but we have many very compelling deals in each of them. ” Trump for years has routinely named corporate entities after the projects to which they were connected. Companies set up as part of licensing or management deals in Indonesia and India bear the names of the cities where those projects are located. The same is true for some of his companies connected to properties and business ventures in the United States. Four of the companies recently dissolved included Jeddah, a major Saudi city, in their formal names. The entities were established three months after Ivanka Trump’s comments, during the presidential campaign. Four more businesses similarly named were also set up around the same time then closed a few months later. Garten said Friday that the dissolution of the companies, which occurred last month, was part of a periodic process to shed corporate entities that were no longer needed or were set up for ventures that did not materialize. Garten said he did not know why the companies were set up last year or whether they involved business ventures in Saudi Arabia that didn’t happen. “I’m not aware of any deal in Saudi Arabia,” Garten told the Associated Press. “I’ll go further: there is no deal in Saudi Arabia. ” Garten declined to say whether the closures were related to Trump’s election or his expected announcement next week about how he will be handling his businesses as president.

Nuclear weapons: how foreign hotspots could test Trump’s finger on the trigger
On Donald Trump’s first day in office he will be handed the “nuclear biscuit”  —   a small card with the codes he would need to talk to the Pentagon war room to verify his identity in the event of a national security crisis. Some presidents have chosen to keep the “biscuit” on them, though that is not foolproof. Jimmy Carter left his in his clothes when he sent them to the  . Bill Clinton had it in his wallet with his credit cards, but then lost the wallet. Others have chosen to give the card to an aide to keep in a briefcase, known as the “nuclear football” together with a manual containing US war plans for different contingencies and one on “continuity of government” where to go to ensure executive authority survives a first nuclear strike. The “biscuit” and “football” are the embodiment of the awesome,   power that will be put in Trump’s hands on 20 January. They only become relevant in very rare moments of extreme crisis, but a US president’s ability to manage crises around the world will help determine whether they become extreme. There is one such situation already in the   Trump will find on his desk, on the Korean peninsula, where the North Korean regime is rapidly developing a   nuclear missile. Another could blow up at any time with Russia, whose warplanes are flying increasingly close to Nato planes and ships in a   game of chicken. And Trump could trigger a third crisis, with Iran, if he follows through with his threat to tear up last year’s agreement curbing its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief. Trump’s election has added a new layer of uncertainty to all these potential flashpoints. “I have no idea what he would do, and neither I suspect, does he,” said James Acton, the   of the nuclear policy programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Let’s not kid ourselves he has policies for these issues. He doesn’t have a team that has done deep dives into these questions. ”  During the campaign, 10 former US nuclear launch officers, who once manned missile silos and held the keys necessary to execute a launch order, signed a letter saying Trump should not have his “finger on the button” because of his temperament.  One of those former officers, Bruce Blair, said that if US early warning radar showed the country was under attack by nuclear missiles, there would be time for a president to receive a briefing that could be as short as 30 seconds and the    would then have between three and 12 minutes to make up his mind. He would have to take into account that the early warning system had been wrong before and could be vulnerable to ever more sophisticated hacking. “I think [Trump] lacks knowledge of the world, and knowledge of nuclear weapons and the consequences of their use. He’s not competent. He lashes out at the smallest provocation and he divides the world into winners and losers,” Blair said. “He’s a bully and I wouldn’t have confidence that he would be reasoned and restrained in a crisis. ” Others have argued that in reality, the decision time is not that short. The fact that the US has so many options  —     and   missiles as well as bombers  —   means it does not have to launch on warning of an attack. There would be more time for Trump to think and ask for advice. “The prompt launch of our nuclear missiles is not required nor is it US policy,” Peter Huessy, president of Geostrategic Analysis and a guest lecturer at the US Naval Academy, argued. Kim   has accelerated testing of nuclear weapons and missiles, and most analysts believe he will reach the capability of making a miniaturised warhead that could be put on an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the US west coast within Trump’s first term as president.  Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that Pyongyang could seize the opportunity of presidential transition to test Trump’s mettle. “I am worried about the people Trump is going to put in charge on that file,” Kimball said. “He is facing a very empty bench. Many of the Republican foreign policy establishment are ‘ ’ and the North Korea problem is not going to wait. ” Trump has offered to talk to Kim, offering the possibility of breaking through the diplomatic impasse that has cut off almost all engagement with the regime. But a unilateral move could unnerve US allies in the region, already anxious about Trump’s remarks during the campaign suggesting they do not contribute enough to deserve the shelter of the US nuclear umbrella.  “He has talked about Nato and our alliances with South Korea and Japan as though they are protection rackets,” Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Programme at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. “This is particularly dangerous in South Korea, where there is a significant group of people who think Seoul should be more independent of Washington and acquire nuclear weapons. Asked about Japan or South Korea building nuclear weapons, Trump said ‘have a good time’. Japan probably won’t take him up on the offer, but South Korea might. I worry South Korea might be followed by Taiwan. ” Trump has threatened to tear up the nuclear deal six major powers signed with Iran last year, in which Iran scaled down its nuclear programme in return for relief from international sanctions. He and other Republicans have argued that the US would get more concessions if they reapplied sanctions. “That would be a catastrophic decision,” Acton said. “The other parties to this deal would still consider themselves bound by it, whether or not the US did. If we withdrew, the Iranians would demand redress, and the other parties would be sympathetic. If you want to put pressure on Iran you need multilateral sanctions. Behaving unilaterally is very unlikely to work. ” Even before taking office, Trump would be under heavy pressure from the other parties to the deal  —   the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China  —   who have started investing and trading with Iran, not to deliver on his threat.  Doing so could isolate the US and potentially trigger a nuclear arms race in the Gulf.  Trump has claimed he could improve relations with Russia, and in particular with Vladimir Putin personally, that would defuse the high tensions over Ukraine and Syria. Such deals could well be at the expense of the people of those countries, but could conceivably lessen the chances of a complete end to arms control and the return to an expensive and dangerous nuclear arms race. Hans Kristensen, a nuclear expert at the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) points out that the deepest cuts in nuclear arsenals have been achieved by Republican administrations. “Republicans love nuclear weapons reductions, as long as they’re not proposed by a Democratic president,” Kristensen wrote on an FAS blog, “That is the lesson from decades of US nuclear weapons and arms control management. If that trend continues, then we can expect the new Donald Trump administration to reduce the US nuclear weapons arsenal more than the Obama administration did. ”  The current arms treaty limiting the strategic arsenals of both countries, New Start, expires in 2021. A decision will have to be made whether to replace it or let arms control wither. Both Putin and Trump could save tens of billions of dollars by cutting arsenals. As part of any deal, however, Putin would ask for the scrapping of the US missile defence system currently being erected in eastern Europe. Any concessions on the US   nuclear weapon modernisation programme, which Trump endorses in his transition website, would bring him in direct conflict with the Republican establishment.  “I could imagine Trump personally being more flexible,” Acton said. “But it would set up a huge fight with Congress. Congress loves missile defence. ”

The view from Middletown: ’This election has revealed a divided America’
Today we bring you two updates from Muncie in part eight of our series  —   a video in which Gary asks whether the deep divides revealed by this election can be reconciled afterwards, and interviews with residents about the electoral issues they consider crucial.  Over the past few weeks we’ve been asking people who live and work in Muncie to help guide and shape the Middletown series. They have been sharing the issues they think are important, and suggesting who Gary should meet in the city.  Collaboration is important for a project like this because the community provides nuance and insight that is difficult to uncover when you’re only in a place for a short time. We would not have known to contact some of the people interviewed for this project had readers not told us about them. It’s my job to support Gary’s reporting by managing those callouts and working with people who’ve got in touch.  When we report on a place, it’s essential to give the people who live there a voice, which is why this article is a little different. The issues that the contributors have discussed in this piece are reflected in the wider community. Many identified everyday challenges such as drug addiction, racism and class divide, however they also spoke of Muncie as a very special place to live. This is a city where there is positive change, new development, a vibrant arts scene  —   but it’s also a place where community matters and people like to help each other. This series is about how people in Muncie experience politics during this election  —   most striking when I was interviewing them for this piece was a sense of how voters felt let down by both presidential candidates. Nearly everyone I spoke to was trying in some way to unify Muncie, and that gets so much harder when the vicious political discourse fuels divisiveness. As one contributor, Cornelius Dollison, put it: “Muncie is getting better, but we as a country have a long way to go. ” Read part eight here. Or you can catch up on the project in full, send us your thoughts or recommendations here and get involved on Facebook here. Caroline BannockEditor, community and   content

Saturday Night Live: 2016’s best skits
In any election year, politics and current events dominate Saturday Night Live, and that was certainly the case in 2016. And in a year with fairly significant changes in the cast and writing staff, the quality of the guest host affected the show massively  —   if only they could all be Tom Hanks. Kate McKinnon was the clear breakout star of the year, bringing both technical skill and nuanced characterization to both her Hillary Clinton and Kellyanne Conway impressions, while Kenan Thompson remained the show’s most   stalwart. Here are a look at some of the year’s best sketches: It’s been less than two months since this sketch aired, but naming it as the show’s finest of the year already feels obvious  —   in the week after it ran, it was the subject of a slew of lauditory pieces about its shrewd take on race and class relations in America. With Tom Hanks starring as a   white contestant on Black Jeopardy, the sketch (written by Michael Che and Bryan Tucker) explored the similarities between a white,   Trump voter and mainstream black culture, without ever forgetting the profound differences that separate them. In the past, Black Jeopardy sketches were a way of highlighting the cluelessness of liberal whites elites here, the show empathized with white Americans who are also overlooked by those same liberal elites. But all of that political depth only worked because the jokes  —   “He says his dog doesn’t bite. ” “What is, mmm, I don’t know, he got teeth, don’t he?”  —   were perfectly timed, expertly delivered and built to a beautiful “Final Jeopardy” reveal. While Kellyanne Conway may not have won many friends in the mainstream media during this campaign season, Kate McKinnon’s take on her has been consistently sympathetic, portraying her as a woman who has aligned herself with Donald Trump and now, having made her bed, knows she must lie in it. In this sketch from early October, Conway finally receives a day off from work, which she gleefully uses to eat breakfast with her family, catch up on her yoga and cuddle with her husband. Or she would, if she wasn’t called away constantly to respond to  —   and defend  —   an escalating series of insane from the   candidate. “Of course black people don’t have one less toe than white people,” she replies stoically as she rolls through her home television studio on roller skates. It would be tempting to demonize Conway for her association with Trump and her general disinterest in facts the decision to show her as a fundamentally decent person in a hopeless situation is far more interesting and will give the show more to work with in the next few years. In the weekend before the electoral college voted for Donald Trump, SNL took advantage of one of its last reasonable reasons to resurrect McKinnon’s exceptional Hillary Clinton impression, as Clinton secretly knocks on the door of an elector to deliver a Love   plea for voting against Trump. The sketch doesn’t go easy on Clinton’s   persona  —   she uses several cue cards to rehash her   resume and eventually admits that she’s “literally never seen a movie”  —   but is ultimately sympathetic to the former secretary of state and her case to unfaithful electors: “Bish . .. he cray. ” Her plea for the elector to vote for literally anyone other than Trump (“The Rock. A rock”)  —   are done with wit and heart, while her final warning  —   “But keep in mind, if Donald Trump becomes president, he will kill us all”  —   pulls no punches. Dave Chappelle was an ideal host for SNL’s first   episode, a natural at biting satire on America’s race issues from his   perch as a wise elder statesman. His monologue  —   largely made up of his own   with some   topical additions  —   addressed his lack of surprise at Trump’s victory this sketch continued the idea, as he watches with a wry smile as his white friends slowly realize what is happening over election night. With a guest cameo from Chris Rock, the show highlighted the delusions of white liberals going into election night  —   “Early returns are always gonna be Republican because Republicans go to sleep early. That’s just a fact. ”  —   and the bittersweet pleasure that some took in seeing their illusion shattered. The only completely apolitical sketch on this list was one of the rare times when SNL went for weird nonsense and totally nailed it. McKinnon and Beck Bennett joined elevator operator Kenan Thompson for a “100 Floors of Fright” what they got was beyond their wildest dreams. The slow build of this scene, Tom Hanks’      performance, those two dancing skeletons, and the perfect straight reactions of McKinnon and Bennett turned a “wtf is this?” sketch into an instant classic. Having suffered some serious backlash after allowing Trump to host the show back in November 2015, SNL was clearly making an effort to take on the candidate’s inflammatory rhetoric as the campaign wore on. This was their first and still sharpest attack a mock campaign ad featuring Trump supporters giving their reasons for backing the candidate. The joke kicks in at 35 seconds, revisiting the series of seemingly reasonable white people to reveal their true intentions. All the jokes in the sketch are visual, but suffice to say it serves as an unflinching take on many of the backers of the  . SNL does Christmas songs very well and this year, the show took advantage of musical guest Chance the Rapper for this ode to outgoing president Barack Obama. I’m no music critic, but even I can tell that this    song has some solid rhymes and a classic beat, as well as some dire warnings: “     Christmas,     ’s still here. Hey kid, enjoy the presents while you can, ’cause next year you might get a bomb from Iran. ” With a guest turn from original   member Darryl McDaniels and some impressive dance moves from Casey Affleck’s Jesus, it was the perfect blend of politics and great  . SNL remains one of the few mainstream comedy shows in America, theoretically appealing to people across the country and the political spectrum in ways that shows like Key  Peele or Full Frontal with Samantha Bee don’t even attempt. Based in New York City and generally written by young comedians, it often tilts to the left of the political spectrum, but at its finest, it recognizes the insular world in which it sits. Here, in the   fog, the show mocks the young Brooklynites who are too progressive too live among so many people who don’t agree with them, offering them a literal bubble for “likeminded freethinkers and no one else” as they move into the difficult days of 2017. In the past couple years, SNL has wisely used its newly diversified cast and writing staff to address race and gender more often, and this was a shining example of the show using the power of its   cast  —   with help from host Ariana Grande  —   to address just how difficult it is to nail feminism in this    internet age. “This is not a feminist song, so technically it can’t be wrong,” the catchy jingle proudly proclaims as the line of women dance up the Coney Island boardwalk in a perfect imitation of a lazy,   pop song that twists and turns as it goes.

Vigil held in German town for woman dragged through streets
Outrage over an attack on a woman who was dragged through the streets of a north German town behind a car with a rope tied around her neck has prompted hundreds of people to attend a vigil for her. The    woman is in a coma in a critical condition in hospital in Hamelin following the incident on Sunday evening.  Her former partner, a    man, handed himself in to police and is in custody facing a potential charge of attempted murder. He and the woman are believed to be of Kurdish origin. The woman was dragged along the road for about 250 metres. Her    son was reportedly in the back of the car at the time. Locals attending the vigil held up placards reading “incredible” and “stop violence against women”. Hamelin’s mayor, Claudio Griese, addressed the crowds by saying that acts of violence were an unfortunate part of society but that Sunday’s incident had been particularly horrific. “No one could have imagined that such a barbaric act that reminds us of executions of the middle ages was possible in a town such as Hamelin,” he said. He said the vigil, which was attended by members of the victim’s family including her brother and his children, sent the message: “Violence has no place in this town. ”

Vladimir Putin orders 10-hour Aleppo truce on Friday
Vladimir Putin has ordered a   truce on Friday in the   Syrian city of Aleppo, the Russian defence ministry has said. “A decision was made to introduce a ‘humanitarian pause’ in Aleppo on 4 November from 9am to 7pm,” the chief of Russia’s general staff, Valery Gerasimov, said in a statement on Wednesday. Gerasimov said the decision was approved by Syrian authorities and was meant to “prevent senseless casualties” by allowing civilians and armed combatants to leave the   eastern part of the city.  He said eight corridors  —   six for civilians and two for fighters  —   could be used for this. Rebels launched a major assault on Friday to break the siege of Aleppo but have been met this week by fierce resistance from regime forces. Aleppo has been hit by some of the worst violence in Syria’s   conflict, turning the once bustling economic hub into a divided and   city.  The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said on Tuesday that Russia had ceased airstrikes on eastern Aleppo for 16 days, following criticism over a   Syrian government assault that has killed hundreds of civilians and destroyed infrastructure, including hospitals. The halt in bombing was initially declared ahead of a short ceasefire that ended last month. Moscow at the time ruled out a truce extension.  Shoigu accused the   coalition of failing to rein in hardline rebels and said that the chances of a political settlement to the crisis was now remote.  The west has accused Moscow of committing possible war crimes in Aleppo through indiscriminate bombing to support a brutal Syrian government offensive. Moscow has been conducting a bombing campaign in Syria in support of   ally Bashar   since September 2015.

Climate change: the missing issue of the 2016 campaign
The race for the White House is failing to grapple with the key issues of the day, especially the urgent need to combat climate change before atmospheric changes become irreversible, a slice of the American electorate believes. As the primary election season turns toward a    between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, there is increasing anger and frustration over the nature of the contest. A Guardian   to online readers in the US asking them to reflect on the race so far was met by a barrage of criticism on the tone and substance of the world’s most important election  —   with the two main parties, individual candidates and the media all coming under heavy fire. The Guardian asked readers to identify the “one issue that affects your life you wish the presidential candidates were discussing more”. Resoundingly, the largest group of participants pointed to climate change. Of the 1, 385 who responded to the    —   from all 50 states  —   one in five expressed discontent at the relative silence from candidates around a subject that they believed to be of supreme and epochal importance. They noted that much of the Republican debate has either focused on blatant denial that climate change even exists or on how to unpick Barack Obama’s attempts to fight global warming, while on the Democratic side both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have raised the issue but have rarely pushed it to the top of the political agenda. Many of the respondents vented despair at a political system that in their view allowed a matter of such overwhelming significance to be so overlooked. “The fact that no one is really talking about climate change, to me, is indicative of just how lost we are,” said Linda Hayden, 51, from Oregon. “Our house is on fire and we are arguing about who is more angry!” Vivid words and phrases were used to articulate the scale of the pending disaster that readers accused the presidential hopefuls of ignoring, such as “cataclysmic” “running out of time” “threat to human life” “path towards destruction” or in one particularly memorable remark: “  apocalypse”. A reader from Alaska, a state acutely feeling the impact of climate change, used the word “Doomed!” while an    woman from Tennessee who asked to remain anonymous simply said: “Freaking global climate change. ” Jennie Ratcliffe, 66, from North Carolina quibbled with the Guardian’s wording of the question, saying “this is far more than an ‘issue’  —   it’s a crisis”. “I’m a climate scientist, and almost no one in the general public knows just how serious and urgent this really is,” said Peter Kalmus, 41, from Altadena, California. “Not only is it real  —   it’s terrifying. ” The concerns of voters came to light as part of the Guardian’s Voices of America series which aims to highlight the way key issues have been ignored or   during a primary season when trivial personal attacks seemed to take precedence over substantial debate of issues that matter. The Guardian   was not a poll, and as such was not a controlled survey of opinion. But it does illuminate a largely hidden depth of concern, particularly among liberal Americans, about a gathering global disaster that has tended to be discussed, if at all, at the fringes of the presidential debate. Most of the respondents were  . About 80% said they planned to support a Democratic candidate  —   by comparison, around 31% of Americans overall describe themselves as Democrat (a higher 49% if you include those who say they are “ ”). That disparity is likely to have influenced the fact that climate change was top of the pile of priorities for those who participated  —   only 19 of the 284 respondents who mentioned climate change said they were unaffiliated to a party and just two described themselves as Republican. This ideological gap also plays out in public opinion research which uses a nationally representative sample of respondents. Last year, Pew Research Center found that 76% of liberal Democrats said that “global warming is a very serious problem” compared to 14% of conservative Republicans. That is perhaps a reflection of a fundamental disagreement among Americans about the reasons for, and even existence of, climate change. Pew found that 64% of Democrats believed global warming was caused by human activity while only 22% of Republicans agreed. Participants in the Guardian project reserved their greatest ire for those Republican candidates who have expressed skepticism on the campaign trail that   climate change exists at all. Among prominent GOP contenders, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio all cast doubt while they were running on climate change science while Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, John Kasich and Rand Paul argued against the need for urgent action to tackle the problem. The presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, has said he is “not a great believer” in   climate change, suggesting it is a hoax put about by the Chinese. When he set out his energy plan, he promised to cancel the Paris climate agreement that commits countries to reduce levels of polluting emissions. Anthony Friedline, 31, of Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, was one of many respondents who expressed frustration at how the subject had been treated during the presidential TV debates: “One party thinks it is a hoax, and on the other side no one wants to discuss it except Bernie Sanders who the media doesn’t want to give the time of day because he isn’t part of the ‘establishment’. Who cares about ‘establishment politics’ when the fate of the whole damn planet is in our hands and we, apparently, are going to do nothing to fix it?” Forest   32, from Oregon, wrote that “the Republicans still haven’t admitted climate change exists, but even Democrats are not making it a priority like they should. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have mentioned it, but are not prioritizing it enough. All the candidates act as if this isn’t happening, and everyone knows that it is. Let’s get real folks!” The strikingly bleak view of so many American voters towards the presidential election process chimes with the dismay of prominent environmental groups and campaigners who had hoped that the race for the most powerful job on earth would become a channel for serious discussion about how to tackle climate change.  Michael Brune, executive director of the 2. 4   Sierra Club, America’s largest environmental movement, said: “Our members are in shock right now about Donald Trump  —   they are asking how we got to this point and what must be done to stop him becoming president. ” Brune added: “We feel it’s unconscionable that the overwhelming coverage has focused on the size of Trump’s hands or how he belittles his opponents, as opposed to how our civilization will be powered and climate change averted. ” The climatologist Michael Mann, who is director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, said he did believe that Clinton and Sanders had engaged in meaningful dialogue about climate change, and pointed the finger of blame at the media for failing fully to reflect that. He added that as the general election gets underway he hoped there would be more focus on “substantive and critical differences in the views of the candidates, and less focus on frivolous and prurient matters that serve as little more than distraction and misdirection”.  Mann said: “The American people could not have a starker choice before them between a presumptive candidate of one of the two parties who recognizes the risk posted by   climate change and articulates solutions, and the presumptive candidate of the other party, who denies that climate change is even real. ”  The   of the climate campaign 350. org, Bill McKibben, who Sanders has appointed to the platform committee at the upcoming Democratic national convention, struck a positive note by pointing out that in the 2012 presidential race between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, climate change was not raised at all until just days before the election as a result of Hurricane Sandy. “This time around, whoever the Democrat is will be hammering Trump and the rest of the GOP for their blindness to climate science  —   it’s now a losing proposition for them. So, scientists and movements have done their job in that way. ”  But he went on to warn that “merely believing in climate change at this point is way too low a bar. We need leaders who understand it’s the issue of our century, and will work with the focus it requires. ” Climate change was the most prominent among a host of different political concerns that respondents to the   complained were being insufficiently aired during the election. Accounting for one in 10 responses, the next most common group of worries related to tax reform, income inequality and poverty . Similarly high were mentions of campaign finance and corruption in politics, those too made up around one in ten responses. Insecurity was a theme in many of the responses  —   8% of respondents said they wanted leaders to focus on foreign policy while 7% said job security. Most of our respondents skewed towards the Democratic party. Amongst those who were explicit, 577 said they were Bernie Sanders supporters while just 53 said they were voting for Hillary Clinton. A further 81 respondents saying they would vote for Trump. Note: quotes have been lightly edited for grammar and brevity.

Chinese warship seizes US underwater drone in international waters
The Chinese navy has seized an underwater drone in plain sight of the American sailors who had deployed it in international waters, in a seemingly brazen message to the incoming Trump administration. According to a US defence official, the unmanned glider had come to the surface of the water in the South China Sea and was about to be retrieved by the USNS Bowditch, an oceanographic and surveillance ship, when a Chinese naval vessel that had been shadowing the Bowditch put a small boat in the water. Chinese sailors in the small boat came alongside the drone and grabbed it despite the radioed protests from the Bowditch that it was US property in international waters. The incident happened about 100 miles   of the Philippines’ port of Subic Bay.  The US has issued a formal protest and demanded the return of the glider. Peter Cook, the Pentagon press secretary, said the Bowditch made radio contact with the Chinese ship and asked for the glider to be returned. “The radio contact was acknowledged by the [Chinese] navy ship, but the request was ignored,” Cook said. “The UUV [unmanned underwater vehicle] is a sovereign immune vessel of the United States. We call upon China to return our UUV immediately, and to comply with all of its obligations under international law. ” The aggressive Chinese gesture comes at a time of rising tensions between China and the US in the South China Sea, where Beijing has claimed ownership of a number of reefs and small islands  —   which it is in the process of militarising  —   while the US navy has been conducting patrols nearby to assert freedom of navigation in the sea lanes. The tension has spiked since Donald Trump was elected in November. The US   quickly broke a   protocol by taking a call from the president of Taiwan, and openly questioned Washington’s longstanding “one China” policy that does not recognise Taiwan as a separate state. Beijing has signalled it would respond dramatically if Trump implements a break in policy once he takes office on 20 January. In recent days, China has conducted bomber patrols close to Taiwan in a flexing of its military muscle. The seizure of the drone is also a reflection of the struggle occurring under the surface of the South China Sea. As China develops a strategic submarine fleet, with the potential to carry nuclear missiles out into the Pacific Ocean, the US has built up a monitoring network designed to spot Chinese submarines as they leave their bases. Drones are key to the network, and there is a race under way between major naval powers to develop drones that can work together in swarms and “see” long distances through the water. Underwater gliders are drones that can stay underwater on the lookout for submarines for long periods of time. “This looks like signalling from the Chinese in response to Trump’s Taiwan call,” said Bonnie Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. “It is hard to believe this is the action of an independent commander. The Chinese now have much better control over the military, particularly the navy. It is in China’s interest to send signals before Trump is inaugurated, so that he gets the message and be more restrained once he is office. ” Sebastian   of the British American Security Information Council said: “Nuclear states are increasing anxious about unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs, or underwater drones) autonomously tracking their nuclear ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) making them vulnerable to antisubmarine warfare. This is an issue for China in particular, whose SSBN fleet is small and noisy. Though the USNS Bowditch is an oceanographic ship and may sound harmless, the kinds of data it is collecting will make Chinese submarines easier to find over time. “China therefore accomplishes a number of things by seizing a US underwater drone,”   said. “It allows Chinese scientists to better understand the US’s offensive technical capabilities in this area, and potentially allows them to   them, bringing gains in both the commercial and military spheres. ” Glaser pointed out that the Chinese have frequently tested the US when there is a new administration. In the early months of the George W Bush administration, in 2001, the Bowditch was involved in a close encounter with a Chinese frigate which turned on its gun control radar and forced it to retreat. A week later there was a collision between a US spy plane and Chinese warplane off China’s Hainan island. At about the same point in the early Obama administration, in March 2009, a number of Chinese navy ships harassed another US oceanographic vessel, the USNS Impeccable, coming as close as 50ft away, trying to snag its acoustic equipment with hooks, waving flags and demanding the Impeccable leave the area.

Wage gap between white and black Americans is worse today than in 1979
Black Americans today earn even less relative to their white counterparts than they did in 1979, according to a new report by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI). The report, released by the   thinktank on Tuesday, shows that the gap between wages of both black and white men and black and white women has widened over the last 36 years.  Black men’s average hourly wages went from being 22. 2% lower than those of white men in 1979 to being 31% lower by 2015. For women, the wage gap went from 6% in 1979 to 19% in 2015. “The finding that stands out the most, our major result, is that the racial wage gaps were larger in 2015 than they were in 1979. That’s huge because the impression people have, in general, is we know there’s still racism in this country, but we think or at least believe that it’s getting better,” said Valerie Wilson, director of the EPI’s program on race, ethnicity and the economy and one of the report’s authors.  The EPI report comes a week after the US Census Bureau found that in 2015, median income for white Americans went up 4. 4% and that of black Americans went up by 4. 1%. While everyone’s income went up in 2015, a large racial divide remains. The median household income for white Americans in 2015 was $63, 000. That’s 70% more than the median household income of black Americans, which was $36, 898. One of the main reasons that income for black Americans is not increasing at the same rate as that of white Americans is the starting salaries of college graduates within each group. According to the EPI, black male college graduates “started the 1980s with less than 10% disadvantage relative to white male college graduates but by 2014 similarly educated new entrants were at a roughly 18% disadvantage”. The report was unequivocally grim for black women, especially those who are young. The researchers found that the current wave of inequality has hit young black women the hardest. Since 2000, when the gap began widening, it’s black women just entering the workforce who have seen their wages fall the farthest compared with their white peers. The wage gap between white and black workers is still at its largest between men. But since 1979, the gap has grown fastest among women.   years ago, black women earned only 6% less than white women. Today, black women earn 19% less than white women. Differences in educational attainment and other factors, like the fact that black women are more likely to work in the south, explain only a third of that gap. You can see this trend writ small among highly educated black women, Wilson said. At the beginning of the 1980s, black women with a college degree or higher and white women with a college degree or higher earned roughly the same wages. But today, wages for black women with a college degree or higher are 12. 3% less than those of their white counterparts. That is double the disparity experienced by black women with only a high school degree.  At the same time that the racial wage gap has widened, the gender wage gap has narrowed significantly. But the effects of racial discrimination have all but erased those gains for black women.  “There’s no question that white women benefited more from the narrowing of the gender wage gap than black women,” said Wilson.  She noted that in the 1990s, while the gender wage gap for white women grew noticeably smaller, for black women, the disparities stayed the same. “Black women are faced with both kinds of discrimination,” Wilson said. “And that racial disadvantage has basically limited their achievements in narrowing the gender gap. ” The EPI report released on Tuesday included some measures the US could take to close the wage gap between black and white Americans. The suggestions included increasing the federal minimum wage, enforcing laws to prevent “wage theft” and discrimination, developing ways to assess the role discrimination plays on wages of black Americans and a summit to address the low starting salaries of black Americans.

Theranos to close its labs and blood-testing centers and lose 340 staff
Elizabeth Holmes, the embattled founder and chief executive of Theranos, said late on Wednesday that the company will close its clinical labs and Walgreens testing centers in the US. In an open letter posted on the company’s website, Holmes praised the   business that she once boasted would change the world with its inexpensive pinprick blood test, and was once the toast of Silicon Valley. In magazine interviews, TV appearances and keynote speeches she gave around the world, Holmes said the innovation would empower consumers by giving them the ability to bypass the gatekeepers  —   their doctors  —   to get important information about the health of their own bodies.  Numerous investors and consumers fell for her story, and at one point the company was valued at $9bn, making Holmes the youngest   female billionaire ever. But as the company grew, so did questions about its technology. In a series of skeptical reports starting in October 2015, the Wall Street Journal recounted how even Theranos’s own employees questioned the accuracy of the results of its testing and revealed that government regulators had been looking into the matter.  The company aggressively defended itself against the accusations but in summer 2016 began to acknowledge some major defeats.  In June, Walgreens said it had terminated its partnership with the   startup effective immediately.  In July, the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services imposed harsh sanctions against Theranos, levying a fine, revoking its certification to operate labs and banning Holmes from owning, operating or directing a   lab for at least two years.  The company also faces federal criminal and civil investigations into whether it misled investors. The company denies any wrongdoing.  Wednesday’s announcement by Theranos essentially shuts down the   operations that were at the heart of the vision Holmes promoted.  The move will affect about 340 employees in Arizona, California and Pennsylvania. “We are profoundly grateful to these team members, many of whom have devoted years to Theranos and our mission, for their commitment to our company and our guests,” Holmes wrote.  The company will now focus its “undivided attention” on its new Theranos miniLab platform, which she described as a product that would be “miniaturized, automated laboratories capable of   sample testing, with an emphasis on vulnerable patient populations, including oncology, pediatrics, and intensive care”. Theranos’s journey is a cautionary tale for the investors and reporters who showered praise on the company with little scrutiny. The firm raised more than $720m in funding before questions were raised over its core intellectual property.  What kind of due diligence did venture capitalists conduct before handing over millions of dollars? A number of scientists expressed doubts about Theranos early on, while more cautious investors tend to avoid medical companies unless their core product has been rigorously tested and  .  Theranos is not the only Silicon Valley company to have doubt cast upon its core science. Former employees said that San   vegan food company Hampton Creek, which markets itself as a technology company, exaggerated how advanced its technology was. More recently Bloomberg reported that the company had been engaged in an alleged undercover buyback campaign, where members of staff were tasked with buying up jars of Hampton Creek’s eggless mayonnaise product Just Mayo. The US justice department has since opened up a criminal investigation into whether the company committed fraud.

Bernie Sanders: ’We are going to hold Trump to account’ – as it happened
You can find our latest wrap of the evening’s events, with both Clinton and Sanders defending their vision( s) here. Thanks for reading: the live blog will be back tomorrow. Video: Hillary Clinton’s full speech to the Children’s Defense Fund. One of the key men behind Donald Trump’s transition to power is a    real estate mogul, businessman and publisher called Jared Kushner. He is also married to Trump’s influential daughter Ivanka, and is in line to be arguably the most powerful    to ever set foot in the White House. During the latter stages of the campaign it was Kushner who effectively functioned as Trump’s campaign manger. He advised him on strategy, drafted his speeches and ran the candidate’s digital media campaign. But eight days after Trump’s unexpected victory, Kushner is now at the centre of a messy and Shakespearean   transition process, variously described as infighting, a “Stalinist purge” and a “knife fight”. On Friday, New Jersey governor Chris Christie was abruptly sacked as head of the transition team and replaced with Trump’s    Mike Pence. Christie’s ousting is thought to be the result of a feud with Kushner. As a federal prosecutor, Christie prosecuted Kushner’s father, Charles, who was convicted and jailed on charges of tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign contributions. He got two years in jail, and was released after one. While he was in jail, Kushner took over the running of his father’s property business. Earlier this week, two more senior members of Trump’s team were sacked. They were Mike Rogers, who had been handling national security, and Matthew Freedman, a lobbyist and liaison with business and foreign governments. Both were allies of Christie.   tall and patrician, Kushner studied at Harvard and New York universities. (According to Daniel Golden, author of The Price of Admissions: How America’s Ruling Class Buys Its Way into Elite Colleges, he was admitted to Harvard after his father donated $2. 5m to the university.) At age 26, he was conducting his own  . In 2007, he bought an office building on Fifth Avenue for a record $1. 8bn. Most of the cash involved in the acquisition was borrowed. Kushner has one characteristic which sets him apart from Trump’s   entourage: he’s Jewish. (Ivanka Trump converted to Judaism when they married in 2009 the couple have three children who they’re raising as Orthodox Jews.) Kushner has defended his    against persistent accusations of antisemitism, including in a notable piece published by the New York Observer, which he owns. Trump has described his    as a “great guy”. The   has also reportedly taken the unprecedented step of requesting security clearance for Kushner to attend   presidential briefings, the first one of which was on Tuesday. It’s unclear if the request will be approved. It marks an astonishing departure and invites the accusation of nepotism. Megyn Kelly, speaking with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, declared tonight while promoting her new book that   Donald Trump’s lawyer had to be told that if she were to be killed after the lawyer retweeted a demand that she be “gutted,” “it would not help your candidate. ” America is worth it. Our children are worth it. Believe in our country, fight for our values, and never give up. Because over the past two years, I’ve met so many people who’ve reaffirmed my belief in this country. Speaking in New York City, former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton declared at a gala for the Children’s Defense Fund that “no child” should live in fear of their parents being deported, or of violence at their schools because of their race or religion. “No child should have to live with fear like that,” Clinton said, in an apparent reference to   Donald Trump’s proposals regarding undocumented immigrants currently residing in the United States. “No child should be afraid to go to school because they are Latino, or African American, or Muslim, or have a disability. ” “There is work to do,” Clinton continued. “Girls as well as boys, in every country, in every continent, deserve that chance to fulfill their potential. ” “If they can persevere, so can all of us. ” On a conference call with reporters tonight, Republican National Committee strategist Sean Spicer and   Donald Trump’s senior communications advisor, Jason Miller, announced that landing teams will be deployed in the coming days to start the transition process and noted that all of those joining landing teams will sign a pledge that they will not serve as a lobbyist at the federal and state level for the next five years. They also noted several of the meetings that the   had held with potential cabinet members today, including Alabama senator Jeff Sessions, General Mike Flynn, Georgia congressman Tom Price, Kansas congressman Mike Pompeo and charter school activist Eva Moskowitz. They added that Trump is expected to meet tomorrow with South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, Florida governor Rick Scott and former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, among others. Speaking at a gala celebrating the Children’s Defense Fund, former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told the audience of philanthropists and children’s rights activists that although after the loss of the presidential race one week ago, she wanted to “curl up with a book, maybe my dogs, and never leave the house again,” but that she was inspired in part by the stories of the children that the organization helps. “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. Now, sometimes it can feel awfully long   believe me, I know,” Clinton said, to muted laughter. “But it does bend towards justice. ” “You don’t get to stop paying rent just because things don’t go your way,” Clinton continued. “I know that many of you are disappointed in the results of last week’s election   so am I, more than I can ever express, but as I said last week, our campaign was never about one person or even one election,” Clinton said, but about “building an America that is hopeful, inclusive and bighearted. ” Watch it live here.

The view from Middletown: ’The perfect female presidential candidate doesn’t exist’
As Bea Sousa went to cast her vote early at Muncie’s courthouse a couple weeks ago, the historic symbolism of the moment crept up on her unawares. She paused to take it in. “I found myself just standing there for a moment, thinking, ‘Wow. This is great,’” says Sousa, 75, the former spokesperson for the League of Women Voters of   County, formed from the American movement for womens’ suffrage. “I realised for a long time that I would be voting for a woman for president but I didn’t even think about it going into the election room. It lasted only 10 seconds or so. I thought about the women suffragists who had been force fed, who had done amazing things, who had stood up to such abuse. Who put off the fight for women’s votes during the civil war. It’s been a long, long journey, And I thought, ‘This is such a vindication for them. ’” America may be on the brink of electing its first female president. She is in a contest with a man who has been accused of sexual assault in particular and misogyny in general. The gender gap looks likely to be greater than in any previous election. Some women are turning Donald Trump’s hot mic words against him and wearing “Pussy grabs back”   and changing their Twitter profiles to include the term “Nasty Woman” after Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight website reported a gender split in polling and produced maps showing how Trump would win if only men could vote, Trump supporters started a hashtag on Twitter #repealthe19th, calling for the repeal of the 19th amendment, which delivered suffrage for women.  In short, American gender politics has reached a raw and deeply polarised point that this election is both reflecting and accentuating. “In some ways Obama’s presidency and candidacy brought out more of the racial prejudice that might have been suppressed,” says Linda Hanson, the current spokesperson for the LWV in   County, who readers suggested we speak to. “And I think we’re seeing the prejudices in the same way with Hillary. I think her presence is exacerbating the misogyny and drawing it out. ” But while African Americans, among others, overwhelmingly rallied around Obama’s candidacy (delivering him 96% of the black vote) and celebrated the prospect of the first black president, Clinton’s campaign has produced more ambivalence and less excitement among women (among whom she enjoys 50% of the vote ). In Muncie, women are divided on Clinton. The most obvious difference is partisan. Like other Trump voters, women who are voting Republican can’t bear her. At last week’s meeting of the Citizens of Delaware County for Good Government (CDCGG) a conservative campaigning group where half of those in attendance were women, one woman asked: “What has she ever done for women?” Another replied: “Look at the kind of women who are standing behind her. ”  } Responses to Trump’s statements also broadly divide on partisan lines. “They said he was sexist because he called that beauty queen who’d put on weight Miss Piggy,” said one of the women at CDCGG. “But women say that kind of thing about women all the time. ” When it comes to Trump’s assertion that he “grabs women by the pussy,” Jamie Walsh, who is in her early 30s and whose only previous presidential vote was for Obama in 2008, said: “It does bother me but personally I’m not easily offended. I’ve heard worse, I’ve seen worse, I’ve experienced worse  —   and all of a sudden these people haven’t heard all these things before. You’re kidding me. I think the outrage is overplayed for votes. ”  Cathy Day, 48, an English professor at Ball State University who originally backed Bernie Sanders, says: “Since Trump has started boasting about sexually assaulting women the importance of her being a woman has definitely started to speak to me more. ” But like many women here who originally voted for Sanders, Clinton still does not appeal to Day, who displays a sign for every other Democratic candidate in her front yard but the presidential nominee, even if she will vote for her. “As a woman it was kind of hard for me to hear some of the   stuff when I was campaigning for Sanders because I think a lot of it came from a place of misogyny,” she says. “And sometimes it was women saying it. But I identify as a   woman. My class identity is very important to me and her candidacy didn’t really speak to me on that level. ” Morgan Aprill, 23, of the Progressive Student Alliance, backed Sanders and is now voting for the Green candidate, Jill Stein. “I think it’s extremely important that there could be a female president,” she says. “It’ll be good for us too and it’s about time. Of course it’s emblematic. I just wish it was a different woman. I’m voting for another female candidate. ” Sousa, who says she is not a “rabid Hillary fan” herself, believes a higher bar is being set for Clinton than her male counterparts of the past. “I’ve met a lot of women who detest her intensely,” she says. “I can’t take credit for this statement but I heard someone say: ‘We’ve gotten used to voting for males we don’t like. We’ve held our nose and we’ve voted for them for whatever reason. But we aren’t used to doing that with a woman.’ Our culture holds women to a higher standard.  “I always thought that was an excuse not to treat women equally. It hasn’t been that long since women got the vote   …     not even a century yet. So you couldn’t find the perfect woman to run for president any more than you could find the perfect African American to be the first   president. ” Views are also shaded quite heavily by race. Sanders won Delaware County, where Muncie resides, but Clinton won handily in Whitely, the black part of town on the east side. “I’m 33 years old,” says Monique Armstrong, the executive director of Motivate Our Minds which is based in Whitely and offers   and recreational activities to children and teens. “I remember when Hillary was first lady. I’m married but I have not changed my name [as Clinton didn’t initially in her career]. I’m a leader in an organisation. I’ve chosen to dedicate my professional life to improving the lives of children. So when I think about the things they don’t like about her as a candidate they are probably the same things they don’t like about me. ” Finally, there seems to be a generational divide. For younger women, who are far more likely to vote for Clinton than older women, the historical relevance of her possible election may not resonate so much. “I think it’s very hard for women who are in their 20s or 30s to understand what women in their 60s and 70s went through when they were coming up that age,” explains Sousa, who several readers suggested we spoke to. “There’s a lot of women of my age who felt themselves passed over because they were female or were verbally harassed just in thoughtless ways rather than mean ways who do value what she has come through. Women who know that they can get into law school and medical school have a whole different perspective on our history as women. ” Earlier in the campaign season, the local LWV proposed a forum at which candidates from all the parties could explain their policies as it related to women, as they have often done in the past. The Republicans refused to participate. “If you look at the things we raise as being of concern to our members they are consistent,” says Hanson. “They’ve been there for decades. They are pretty mainstream. But now those positions have been identified by some on the far right as being too far left. So the Republican party chair said the candidates didn’t have to participate in our forum and that meant the Democrats couldn’t either. So it didn’t happen. ”  } Most women I’ve spoken to in Muncie think the prospects for gender equality are improving both here and beyond, but there is still significant work to do. To that extent it is fairly typical of America. According to a recent poll, women think more progress has been made in overcoming sexism than racism in the past 20 years by a ratio of almost two to one. Roughly   of women think there’s some or a lot of sexual harassment in the workplace and believe women doing similar work are getting paid less than men. More than half of Americans consider Clinton a role model less than half think she is judged more harshly. Muncie elected its first female mayor, Sharon McShurley, in 2008. McShurley served until 2012, and Hanson says women now occupy some important positions guiding the economic and cultural regeneration of the town. But there is still a long way to go. Hanson says McShurley’s “  was criticised in the same ways that Hillary Clinton’s was   …     they would still talk about the way she spoke, the way she dressed, it was really sexist”. A counsellor at the local women’s shelter, who works with first offenders in spousal abuse, told Sousa that many of the men he sees haven’t seen women treated with respect and that their experience is that’s the way men treat women. “A lot has changed,” says Sousa, “but the underbelly of interpersonal relationships hasn’t. ” That pause for reflection in the ballot box was important, she says, but she doesn’t want to fetishise it. “It was a moment. But I don’t want to make too big a deal out of it. It should just be something that happens. It’s too bad it’s taken so long. But I hope her being a woman doesn’t become the main thing about her as she goes forward. That it’s about what she’s able to do. Once we get past this we can try and move on and take care of the problems this country has because we certainly have a lot of them. ”  }

Go for gold, wind up broke: why Olympic athletes worry about money
More than 11, 000 athletes marched into Rio de Janeiro’s Maracanã stadium on Friday night, officially kicking off the 2016 Olympic Games. Only a handful of them, however, will return home to their countries with medals. Even fewer will find monetary rewards for the tremendous investment many have had to make to reach the Rio games. Of course, a tiny handful with particularly compelling stories  —   assuming they bring home gold  —   will sign lucrative deals with sponsors. Michael Phelps, the most decorated summer Olympian in history and a swimmer tipped to win more medals in Rio, already has an estimated net worth in excess of $50m. Simone Biles, the gymnast whose feats have made even veteran coaches gasp in awe, has had sponsors compete for her endorsement, and agreed to put her star power behind Nike, Special K, laundry detergent and a gymnastics equipment supplier (it’s making mats with her signature on them). It’s safe to say that Biles, too, is on her way to multimillionaire status, if she manages her money well.  Not all successful Olympians do. Indeed, they aren’t exempt from some of the same pressures that confront any young athlete that finds himself suddenly making a lot of money. Like most    athletes, they’ve devoted every waking hour and thought to perfecting their performance, and money considerations often go only to necessities plus coaching, equipment and competitions.   Visa, the credit card company, has launched a global financial education program at the Rio Olympics aimed at helping competitors take control of their financial futures. Designed in partnership with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) it’s a basic financial education package: an introduction to budgets, saving, money management and bank services . The organizations plan to introduce the program at the Olympic Village with training sessions in the fall.   Such programs are sorely needed. Only athletes who compete in   sports stand a chance at earning significant sponsorship revenue, and even then, an injury or poor performance can dramatically affect pay. If your sport is something that only appears every few years at the Olympics  —   say,   speed skating, or kayaking  —   or you finish fourth, a few fractions of a second out of the medals, it’s reflected in your paycheck.   Many Olympians know what that is like: unlike the top female gymnasts, who attract thousands of fans  —   and attendant sponsors  —   many top athletes live close to the poverty line. Want to compete in fencing? Congratulations: be prepared to fork out north of $20, 000 a year. You’re a budding equestrienne? There are plenty of reasons  —   a stable, a horse, a trainer  —   why royalty (Princess Anne of the UK) and billionaires’ children (Michael Bloomberg’s daughter) compete at an elite level. More than 100 US athletes started GoFundMe pages in the   to the Rio games, seeking funds for new equipment and to help them cover their basic living expenses while they tried to concentrate on training. Some have even applied for food stamps.  Many countries promise medal winners cash prizes. This year India will dole out what could be the   sum of 10m rupees, or about $160, 000, to every gold medal winner, $120, 000 to each silver medalist, and $80, 000 for a bronze. Athletes who work for India’s railway system will get extra cash  —   and promotions. China has handed out cash, luxury cars and even new houses. The US will be much less generous: the US Olympic Committee will pay $25, 000 for a gold, $15, 000 for a silver, and $10, 000 for a bronze  —   and medal winners should expect to lose as much as 39% of that in taxes.  But for the vast majority of those thousands of athletes, their moment in the sun is simply qualifying for and making it to the Olympics  —   and striving not to end up broke at the end of it. The US Olympic Committee doesn’t help out all that much  —   between 2009 and 2012, according to one analysis, it spent a mere 10. 3% of its budget supporting athletes. An Olympic medalist who is still competing in her sport could expect to collect only about $50, 000 a year.  But even medalists do end up broke. Ronda Rousey collected bronze for her prowess in judo in Beijing in 2008  —   but a few months later was living out of her Honda Accord, unable to afford rent. She became a bantamweight champion for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) a mixed martial arts league  —   and later sold the car on eBay for $21, 300.   More tragic is the steep fall from success of another Olympic medalist, Debi Thomas. Featured on Time magazine’s cover in 1986, she became the first African American to win a figure skating medal, capturing bronze at the Calgary Olympics of 1988. She graduated from Stanford and earned a medical degree from Northwestern, and become an orthopedic surgeon. Today, that medical license has expired. Thomas has filed for bankruptcy, and lives in a mobile home with her fiance. She isn’t even sure where to find her skates or her medals.   Clearly, there’s more at work in Thomas’s case than being   to deal with the financial realities of “normal” after the Olympics. But athletes and families still dealing with the legacy of all those costs  —   but without the lavish endorsement deals  —   might find it worth their while to quietly spend a few minutes checking out whatever financial planning tools a company offers.  The harsh reality of the economics of the Olympics is that some members of the IOC  —   including folks like Prince Albert of Monaco, who probably doesn’t need the extra cash  —   will earn more simply sitting and watching the games than most of the athletes will earn competing. The sponsorship deals are the exception, not the rule.  That’s a harsh reality that is beyond the control of any Olympian  —   and probably not anything that they should brood over as they prepare to deliver the performance of a lifetime. But win or lose, the athletes face a new challenge: managing their money.

FBI director Comey faces fury for cryptic letter about Clinton email inquiry
Hillary Clinton’s campaign chair on Saturday led a chorus of Democratic party fury over the FBI’s decision to review a new batch of her staff’s emails, which was announced just 11 days before the presidential election in a striking break with law enforcement tradition. The Clinton campaign launched an extraordinary criticism of James Comey, the director of the FBI, who faced anger for his dramatic and late intervention in the race, which deviated from FBI protocol. Comey stood accused of betraying the bureau’s political neutrality, and came under growing pressure to make public everything he knows. The latest twist in a topsy turvy election arrived on Friday afternoon, when Comey said in a letter to Congress the FBI would review whether there was any classified information in new “emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation”. In a carefully worded letter, the director said he wanted to “supplement my previous testimony” about the original Clinton email investigation, which he told Congress had closed this summer, and said: “The FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant. ” On Saturday, Clinton campaign chair John Podesta said: “By providing selective information, he’s allowed partisans to distort and exaggerate in order to inflict maximum political damage and no one can separate what is true from what is not because Comey has not been forthcoming with the facts.  “What little Comey has told us makes it hard to understand why this step was warranted at all. ” It is “entirely possible” that the emails are duplicates of those already studied by the FBI in its earlier investigation into Clinton’s use of a private server while secretary of state, Podesta told reporters on a conference call, adding that Clinton would not be distracted in the final days of the campaign. In July, the FBI closed that investigation. Comey said at the time that Clinton and her aides had been “extremely careless” but not criminal with their email practices. “Director Comey was the one who decided to take this unprecedented step,” Podesta said, “we now learn, against the advice of senior justice department officials who told him it was against longstanding department policy of both Democratic and Republican administrations. “Director Comey was the one that wrote a letter that was light on facts, heavy on innuendo, knowing full well what Republicans in Congress would do with it.  “It’s now up to him, who owes the public answers to the questions that are now on the table, and we’re calling on him to come forward and give those answers to the American public. ” Law enforcement sources speaking anonymously told news outlets the new emails came from devices belonging to Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former congressman and estranged husband of Huma Abedin, one of Clinton’s closest aides. Agents uncovered the emails during an investigation into whether Weiner sent sexually explicit text messages to a teenage girl. Podesta said Abedin had fully cooperated with the FBI investigation from the start. “She’s been fully cooperative. We of course stand behind her. ” Robby Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager, said: “The more information that comes out, the more overblown this entire situation seems to be. That in turn has raised more questions about director Comey from his colleagues in law enforcement circles, to take this extraordinary step just 11 days out from a presidential election. ” Mook highlighted a “startling” Washington Post report that senior officials in the justice department had warned Comey not to go public but he ignored their advice. He also claimed that, based on anecdotes from the ground, Clinton’s supporters were intensifying their efforts to get out the vote. “Our volunteers are rallying behind Hillary,” he said. “They know what a fighter she is   …     They’re as upset and concerned as we are here   …     This has only increased the momentum that we’re feeling among our activists on the ground. ” A jubilant Donald Trump, meanwhile, seized on a potential lifeline for his faltering campaign  —   on Friday describing Clinton’s handling of classified information as a scandal “bigger than Watergate”. With barely disguised anger, Clinton herself demanded the FBI explain itself on Friday. “The American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately,” she told reporters in Des Moines, Iowa. “The director himself has said he doesn’t know whether the emails referenced in his letter are significant or not. ” The content of the messages is unknown  —   and may well remain so beyond election day. “Right now, your guess is as good as mine, and I don’t think that’s good enough,” Clinton said. Comey is a Barack Obama appointee who was deputy attorney general for George W Bush. As well as the Washington Post, the New Yorker reported officials speaking on condition of anonymity saying that Comey was warned by the justice department before sending his letter to Congress.  “He is operating independently of the justice department. And he knows it,” one official told the Post. “It violates decades of practice,” another told the New Yorker. “It’s aberrational. ” Matthew Miller, who served at the department under attorney general Eric Holder, told the Guardian: “I think it was an unacceptable breach of years of department of justice practice and precedent.  “The department goes out of its way not to take any action close to an election that could influence the outcome of that election. The FBI’s reputation for independence and integrity is really at the core to their ability to do their job effectively. ” Miller described Comey’s decision to provide an unprecedented televised statement at the end of the Clinton investigation in July as “the original sin here”. The director then felt able to answer questions from Congress in more detail than usual, but this is “by far the most serious breach of all” Miller added. The former justice department staffer said J Edgar Hoover, the original and controversial FBI director, had done worse than Comey, “but not even Hoover did anything publicly in the closing day of an election that could be seen as tipping the scales. ” Republicans and Democrats alike expressed bafflement at Comey’s timing and ambiguous letter. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a senior Democrat with a history of support for the security agencies, condemned Comey’s conduct. “The FBI has a history of extreme caution near election day so as not to influence the results,” she said. “Today’s break from that tradition is appalling. ” Charles Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, said Comey’s letter to Congress “was unsolicited and, quite honestly, surprising”. He too said it created more questions than answers. “Congress and the public deserve more context to properly assess what evidence the FBI has discovered and what it plans to do with it,” Grassley said. Some analysts speculated that Comey felt caught in a bind: if he waited until after the election, or if the new review leaked through back channels, he would have been accused of a  . In an internal email sent to FBI employees, he said he was concerned about balance: the need to inform Congress and the American people versus the danger of a misleading impression about emails. “In trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter and in the middle of an election season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood, but I wanted you to hear directly from me about it,” he wrote. Early voting is under way in 37 states, nearly 17m votes have been cast, and Clinton has a healthy lead in most polls. “I think people a long time ago made up their minds about the emails,” she said at her press conference. “And now they are choosing a president. ” Though his own campaign has been plagued by one scandal after another, Trump has regularly berated Clinton over the emails, and his supporters at rallies frequently chant: “Lock her up! Lock her up!” On Friday he accused Clinton of corruption “on a scale we have never seen before”.  “We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the oval office,” he told a rally in New Hampshire. “Perhaps, finally, justice will be done. ”  On Saturday, campaigning in Colorado, Trump made an   from his months of criticising the FBI and justice department. “You have amazing people at the Department of Justice, and you have amazing people at the FBI,” he said. “I’ll bet you, without any knowledge, that there was a revolt in the FBI. ” The FBI began investigating Weiner in September, after a Daily Mail report that a    girl had exchanged explicit messages with him. By then, Abedin had already announced a separation from her husband. Trump himself has been accused by several women of sexual assault or inappropriate conduct. He has argued that Clinton “enabled” her husband’s infidelities, and brought three women who accused the former president of wrongdoing to a presidential debate.

NFL denies sending Donald Trump a letter about debate schedule
The dates for this year’s three presidential debates have been in place for a year and “will serve the American public well” the Commission on Presidential Debates said in a statement on Sunday in response to criticism from Donald Trump. The Republican presidential nominee wants two of the three debates moved to avoid clashing with televised NFL games. On Sunday, he also said his opponent would prefer such a clash, saying: “Hillary Clinton wants to be against the NFL. ” Outlining his argument on ABC’s This Week, Trump said: “Well, I tell you what I don’t like. It’s against two NFL games. I got a letter from the NFL saying this is ridiculous   …     because the NFL doesn’t want to go against the debates because the debates are going to be pretty massive, from what I understand. ” He added: “And I don’t think we should be against the NFL. I don’t know how the dates were picked. I don’t know why those particular dates. ” On Saturday, in a statement emailed to the Guardian, the NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said: “While we would obviously wish the debate commission could find another night, we did not send a letter to Mr Trump. ”  The Commission on Presidential Debates is a nonpartisan body, established in 1987. In its statement, it said it was impossible to avoid all sporting events when scheduling debates, and added that presidential debates have never been rescheduled because of conflicts with sporting events. The 2016 debates are set for Monday 26 September at Hofstra University in New York Sunday 9 October at Washington University, St Louis and Wednesday 19 October at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas. The   debate is on Tuesday 4 October, at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. The election is on 8 November.  The NFL schedule has the Atlanta Falcons at the New Orleans Saints on 26 September and a full programme of games on 9 October. In its statement, the commission said: “As a point of reference, in a   period, there are four general election debates   …     and approximately 1, 000 NFL games. ” “You know,” Trump said on ABC, “Hillary Clinton wants to be against the NFL   …     maybe like she did with Bernie Sanders where they were on Saturday nights when nobody’s home. ” Supporters of Sanders claimed that the Democratic National Committee deliberately scheduled its primary debates out of primetime, to shield Clinton, a perception deepened by the release of internal DNC emails after a hack which the Clinton campaign and federal investigators believe was carried out by Russian intelligence services. Trump and his campaign have denied any link to such Russian actors. Other top Republicans insisted on Sunday that the schedule remained open for debate. Trump’s campaign chair, Paul Manafort, told NBC’s Meet the Press: “Look, we’re going to sit down with the commission and talk with them.  “Again, the DNC [email] hack showed you that the Clinton campaign was working to schedule debates against Sanders which ha[d] the least possible viewing audience. Mr Trump [is] saying, ‘Look, we want the maximum viewing audience.’ So I’m not sure, you know, what the dates are going to be ultimately.  “Mr Trump has made it very clear as recently as Friday: he wants the debates. He wants them to have the largest audience. And we’re going to work with the commission to try and identify what those dates are.  “But we’re not going to fall to Hillary Clinton and the ploy that she did against Bernie Sanders of trying to have the   audience. We want the biggest. ” The Republican National Committee chair, Reince Priebus, also said the GOP was “going to be working with the commission” and said Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday nights would attract more viewers. Speaking to CBS’s Face the Nation, Priebus said: “We’re not going to agree with anything that our nominee doesn’t agree with. ”

Body of beheaded Canadian hostage found, say officials in Philippines
Philippine troops on Saturday dug up what they believe is the body of the Canadian hostage Robert Hall, who was beheaded by Abu Sayyaf extremists more than two weeks ago after a ransom deadline lapsed. Villagers led the troops to a hinterland near Kamuntayan village in Sulu province’s Talipao town, where the militants buried Hall’s body after killing him on 13 June. Hall’s head was found outside a Roman Catholic cathedral, the regional military spokesman Maj Filemon Tan said. Tan said chances were high that the body recovered on Saturday was Hall’s, citing intelligence reports and help from villagers. Police forensic experts would confirm the identity, he said. Hall was kidnapped with another Canadian, John Ridsdel, Norwegian Kjartan Sikkengstad and Filipino Marites Flor in September last year in a   resort on Samal Island, also in the south, and taken by boat to Sulu, a predominantly Muslim and impoverished province 590 miles south of Manila. Ridsdel was also beheaded, Sikkengstad remains in Abu Sayyaf custody and Flor has been freed. Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, condemned the killings and called on other nations not to pay ransoms if their citizens were abducted, to discourage the militants from carrying out more ransom kidnappings. Philippine troops have been carrying out an offensive that has killed dozens of militants in Sulu. The Abu Sayyaf, which has more than 400 armed fighters, is blacklisted by the US and the Philippines as a terrorist group for bombings, kidnappings for ransom, beheadings and extortion. The militants have been weakened by years of battle setbacks but remain a national security threat.

New York and Minnesota show how DIY terrorism is the new normal
The weekend’s seemingly disjointed events  —   a bombing in New York City, several unexploded bombs discovered in New Jersey, multiple stabbings in a mall in Minnesota  —   has set Americans on edge again. It remains unclear if these acts were part of a grand international conspiracy, or whether a cell or single individuals are behind them. Yet what we do know is that we now inhabit an age in which it’s logistically straightforward to commit attacks designed to kill and create mayhem, and there are clear ideological rationales for doing so. This toxic combination, along with an occasional willingness to die while carrying out the “operation” makes this new foe  —   call him a terrorist or a disturbed individual  —   particularly difficult to thwart.  It used to take some degree of preparation to carry off a successful attack, especially in the west. The fact that some bombs in New Jersey and one in Manhattan failed to explode is a reminder that building explosives takes some degree of skill if you’re to be successful. Also, convincing your radical comrades to engage in a conspiracy opens you up to penetration by the cops or intelligence services. That is an additional challenge. But stabbing people in a mall or shooting people in a club requires little preparation. You don’t need any particular specialized training anymore except to pull a trigger, drive a car, be willing to kill and desire to be killed.  We’ve seen this DIY violence elsewhere. For example, the atrocity in Nice, France, killed over 80 people, and while multiple suspects were arrested following the attack only one person carried out the operation. In this instance the assailant, Mohamed   drove a large truck into a crowd, crushing scores of people. The carnage only stopped after police shot him dead.  Soft, crowded targets are plentiful in our free, open societies. There is little the authorities can do to keep a determined attacker from striking pedestrians enjoying a balmy Saturday night in New York City. Guns, gates and guards can only provide so much protection against a wily, creative adversary who is willing to risk oblivion. What makes confronting these DIY terrorists even more difficult is that there’s an organization actively and successfully disseminating a   message: the Islamic State. Through its slick social media messaging and global network of personal connections, this organization has been convincing the misguided  —   some of whom are lone wolves  —   to cause havoc in their home countries. This is no accident, but a   plan terror operations outside Iraq and Syria have and will always be part and parcel of the Islamic State’s DNA. For those who wanted to kill people more generally for their own reasons, Islamic State provides them a rationale by which to do so. For example, the San Bernardino killer Syed Rizwan Farook bought his weapons years before he killed 14 people at a holiday party. Why didn’t he commit his crime earlier? We won’t ever know, since he (along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik) is dead, but perhaps Islamic State appears to have given him a reason and a mission to finally take the plunge and destroy himself. As long as Islamic State steadfastly pursues its “victory” narrative, so long as it survives in one physical form or another, people will use its existence as a warped rationale for murderous behavior. Destroying Islamic State and draining the swamp will go a long way to denting the ideological allure of attacking civilians.  At the time of writing, we still don’t quite know the motivations of the NYC bomber or the Minnesota stabber. But we do know that if they were motivated by a jihadist ideology, crushing Islamic State will go a long way to reducing the rationale for this kind of behavior, making our streets safer. This will require sacrifice and great political capital to see it through to the end. Islamic State is fully committed to this conflict, will give no quarter, and will continue to use its power to cause havoc on our streets.  Western nations must be committed to defeating Isis. In the meantime, our societies must be resilient enough to absorb “inspired” or “directed” attacks from the Islamic state and its DIY acolytes for the foreseeable future.

The Good Place: Kristen Bell’s afterlife comedy is simply divine
What’s the name of this show? The Good Place, When does it premiere? There is a   premiere on Monday 19 September at 10pm ET right after The Voice so it can get plenty of attention. Then it settles into its regular time slot on Thursday at 8. 30pm ET, right after Superstore. Oh man, NBC Thursday comedies have sucked lately. Yes, they sure have. The network went broad and   in a bid to be CBS and grab some of that Big Bang Theory syndication cash. But that didn’t work (RIP Sean Saves the World) so The Good Place is a return to form of those great Thursdays of years past when 30 Rock, Parks and Recreation and The Office would rule. Mike Schur, who worked on both The Office and Parks and Rec, created this show. So, what is The Good Place? It’s heaven, silly. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) dies  —   she’s hit by a billboard truck advertising an erectile dysfunction drug  —   and winds up in heaven. The problem is those at the pearly gates think that she is Eleanor Shellstrop, a selfless attorney who got innocent men off death row, but she is really Eleanor Shellstrop, a selfish jerk who sold fake medicine to elderly people. Is heaven a bunch of fluffy clouds with angels playing lyres? No, heaven looks sort of like a very spiffy suburban strip mall with countless frozen yogurt stores, restaurants with punny names (The Good Plates) and, seemingly, an endless supply of stores selling   cardigans and bow ties. Everyones lives in tacky McMansions that you say you would never live in but you totally would if given the chance. This is just one “neighborhood” of heaven and this one’s architect is Michael (Ted Danson) an angel who has been apprenticing for 200 years and this is his first solo project. Each person who gets to heaven is also awarded a soulmate. Eleanor’s is Chidi (William Jackson Harper) a Nigerian ethics professor who can’t decide whether he should help Eleanor stay in The Good Place or send her downstairs. What happens when this bad girl gets into heaven? She literally breaks it. When she steals shrimp from a party, the finely calibrated divine mechanism of eternity is broken and it results in her neighborhood being attacked by giant flying shrimp. Yes, super gross. What’s great about this construction is that it allows for Eleanor’s bad behavior to have immediate and disastrous results, only amplifying how horrible she is and leading her on a path to correct it. This is a great engine for a sitcom because the consequences are extreme and the fixes easy and predicated on being good so that everyone can hug their kids and tell them the world is beautiful before sending them off to bed. Is it funny? Just imagine a woman whose favorite book is Kendall Jenner’s Instagram living in a neighborhood with 322 of the most altruistic, giving, selfless people in creation. Bell’s golden girl looks and devilish behavior are a perfect combination for this role (as is her wonderful comedic timing). Danson proves yet again why he’s one of the best in the business as a hapless angel not used to being human and trying to cover up his errors before any of the higher ups get angry. The jokes let us have it both ways. We get to indulge the devil on one shoulder with Eleanor when she picks on the priggish Chidi, her snooty British neighbor Tahani (Jameela Jamil) or the stuffy customs of the   in heaven. But then we also get to focus on the angel on the other shoulder when Eleanor gets her   slapstick comeuppance for behaving abominably. It’s like all the drinking with none of the hangover  —   just like in heaven. Should I watch this show? Yes, you should. It’s not going to revolutionize television comedy, but it’s a wonderfully sweet,   confection that’s a little bit edgy but still has the wholesome values that will make it acceptable for the whole family.

Never make ever again: The 007 worst James Bond rip-offs in history
The Eurospy era, during which French, Italian and German producers competed to see who could release the cheapest James Bond   at the height of the suave British secret agent’s success, may now belong to some   deeply dubious 1960s belle époque, but 007 continues to have his imitators across the globe. Only this week, the makers of the controversial Valley of the Wolves saga, long considered a Turkish answer to Bond, announced plans for a new instalment about the recent failed coup against president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government. It will see suave   spook Polat Alemdar (Necati Şaşmaz) helping to rescue the dear leader from his loathsome military aggressors. Alemdar’s previous missions include the 2011 episode The Valley of the Wolves: Palestine, in which the spy travels to Israel. Once there, a local man threatens him by saying: “You know you won’t make it out of our promised land. ” Alemdar responds with disdainful,   brio: “I don’t know what part of these lands were promised to you, but I promise you six feet under. ” Knock it if you like, but the franchise is about to enter its fifth movie and has already notched up three TV shows. Yet even Valley of the Wolves pales in comparison with other fabulously terrible offerings from around the world when it comes to ersatz Fleming lunacy. Here are seven to have you choking on your minimally mixed Martini. Released in 1981, the same year as the Roger   For Your Eyes Only, For Your Height Only features 2 ft 9” martial arts star Weng Weng as the diminutive agent 00. His task is to defeat the perfidious villain Mr Giant, who’s trying to take over the world with   technology, while romancing beautiful women almost twice his height. Featuring heroically shonky dubbing, Eddie Nicart’s film is perhaps most impressive for the variety of techniques tiny 00 uses to take down his much larger opponents. These range from poisoned darts to a remote control flying hat (like a   upgrade on Oddjob’s famous   Sandringham) and tiny,   machine gun. But mostly he just creeps up unseen, thanks to his tiny stature, and chopping his rivals in the back of the legs. How do you get around your lack of rights to any of Ian Fleming’s Bond stories, characters, or themes? Well, in the case of Italian producer Dario Sabatello the answer is to recruit Neil Connery, younger brother of then 007 Sean, as well as Bond girl Daniela Bianchi (Tatiana Romanova in From Russia With Love) and Bond stalwarts Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell (M and Moneypenny respectively in the Eon series). Released under a flurry of unsubtle alternative titles, including OK Connery, Operation Kid Brother and Operation 007, Alberto De Martino’s movie pitches plasterer Neil (his performance entirely dubbed by an unknown American actor) as Dr Neil Connery, a plastic surgeon bizarrely recruited by a   Lee (here named Commander Cunningham) for a mission to take down the evil THANATOS organisation. As if the Bond allusions weren’t enough already, two of the main villains were played by Adolfo Celi (Thunderball’s Emilio Largo) and Anthony Dawson (Dr No’s Professor Dent). At the end, Lee turns to his successful agent and shamelessly breaks the fourth wall by telling him: “OK Connery! You were almost better than your brother. ” Notable for racy scenes in which   Bollywood icon Akshay Kumar frolics with his glistening leading lady in a steaming swimming pool (while singing, naturally) Mr Bond also stars Pankaj Dheer as a   apparently   villain named Dragon, who boasts a luxurious pet moustache so substantial that it puts Blofeld’s cat to shame.  Dragon’s uniquely cruel signature turn of evil involves crushing small children to death beneath a large steamroller: not to be put off, Kumar’s Mr Bond fights back with lots of crooning and disco dancing. The movie’s finest sequence features our hero being sung back to life by a gaggle of tiny kiddies after taking a beating from an enemy henchman. Quite why John   fresh from the Lord of the Rings movies, felt the need to appear as an agent for evil terrorist organisation INTERR in this grubby 2001 spy spoof will perhaps never be explained. Part Austin Powers, part Charlie’s Angels, Never Say Never Mind: The Swedish Bikini Team pitches the titular quartet of blonde,   models as international crimefighters tasked by mysterious boss Mr Blue (Bruce Payne) with helping friendly governments and worthy private corporations in the fight against evil. The buxom Swedish Bikini Team first came to public attention in a 1991 advert for Old Milwaukee Beer, drawing complaints of misogyny. So at least they had something in common with Fleming’s famous secret agent. When George Lazenby turned down the chance to return as 007 in a sequel to 1969’s On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, he probably never imagined it would get this bad. Less than two decades later, the   Australian turned up as veteran secret agent Drew Stargrove in the 1986   Never Too Young To Die. A   John Stamos stars as the ostensibly Flemingesque lead, Stargrove’s high school gymnast son who takes revenge following the death of his father at the hands of hermaphrodite villain Velvet Von Ragner (a leering, gurning Gene Simmons of Kiss). The bad guy’s signature kill move involves penetrating his victims with a   fingernail, a murder method known as “the finger” and which sounds deeply unpleasant. Licensed to Love and Kill (aka The Man from S. E. X.) was in fact the second in a series of Bond spoofs based around agent No 1 of the Secret Service, aka Charles Bind. But for the 1979 instalment, Canadian director Lindsay Shonteff somehow managed to convince The New Avengers’ Gareth Hunt to take the lead in a battle against sinister organisation K. R. A. S. H. (Killing Rape Arson Slaughter and Hit) its evil boss, the subtly titled Senator Lucifer Orchid, and a dozen nefarious female henchmen, one of whom fights Bind using nothing more than a pair of spinning boobies. Despite being ostensibly set in the US, the entire film was shot in the home counties  —   and it shows. Early on, Bind asks himself: “What am I doing” and you have to wonder if Hunt was experiencing similar emotions. Maxwell and Lee went moonlighting once again in 1975’s From Hong Kong, With Love, this time seemingly appearing as M and Moneypenny in an early cameo, which must have gone down well with Bond rights holders Eon Productions. Yvan Chiffe’s spoof stars the popular Marx   French group Les Charlots as a team of spies tasked with taking down the villainous Marty, played by an     Mickey Rooney. It was filmed mostly at the Shaw Brothers’ studio in Hong Kong and features a shameless parody of the famous 007 gun barrel sequence in which one of the Charlots apparently shoots himself in the face by accident. Because blowing your own brains out is always hilarious.

Louisville, forever changed by Muhammad Ali, prepares to bury him
Louisville took the blow like a champ: still on its feet. Fists up. Still jawing. On Sunday morning at 22nd Street and Muhammad Ali Boulevard, the Reverend Larry Williams stood before the congregation at Zion Baptist Church and prayed: “We ask for strength for the family of the great Muhammad Ali. ” He raised his voice.  “We pray that they’ll have such peace they can come in rejoicing!” Since word of Ali’s death arrived on Saturday morning, people across the city have come together in public to remember one of the city’s   sons and to boast of his triumphs over his greatest foes. Not Frazier, or Liston or Foreman. But racial discrimination. Cowardice. War. His funeral on Friday will reflect his multifaceted legacy it will be an interfaith service, open to the public, streamed live on the website of the Muhammad Ali Center. From former president Bill Clinton to sportscaster Bryant Gumbel to Billy Crystal, a constellation of eulogists will try to describe the elements of Ali’s personality  —   the magisterial, the athletic, the witty. And it will be, above all, a Louisville affair. Before the service, Ali’s hearse will drive slowly through the city streets to Cave Hill Cemetery. Ali arose from here  —   from a tiny pink house in Louisville’s west side  —   to become the most famous man in the world. He wielded that fame like a left jab. By the time he finished, he had changed the Louisville of his youth  —   a segregated, provincial city  —   for good.  “Not just Louisville. ” said his childhood neighbor, Lawrence Montgomery. “The world. ” Ali started here on Grand Avenue, honing the irrepressible qualities that would carry him to victory inside the ring and out. Montgomery has lived all of his 81 years on the same block of Grand, and as he talked on his front porch his hand moved lightly from scene to scene, outlining ghosts: the site of the old tree, the path to the park, the young Cassius Clay, not yet called Ali.  “He was always, eh . .. braggadocious,” Montgomery said. “I remember him telling me: ‘I’m gonna be the heavyweight champion of the world. You watch.’ And I just laughed because he was a skinny kid. ” Listening to Montgomery is like listening to Ali himself, had Parkinson’s disease not beset him: the accent, the mannerisms, the   eyes that always seem just on the verge of winking.  “I guess that skinny kid showed me,” he said. As a man, Ali would always appear to move without effort, never straining, whether dodging punches or political blows. And some of that was temperament.  “He was always jovial as a boy. Always joking,” Montgomery said.  But much of that quality  —   dancing, flickering  —   came only as the result of intense,   physical and mental focus. Ali only floated like a butterfly, as he bragged, because young Cassius had plodded liked a mule.  “I worked at the post office, and in the mornings I remember seeing him pull on his old hobnail boots,” Montgomery said. His hand traced a line down the street, following an invisible boy. “He would run to the park and back every day before school. And when the school bus came he wouldn’t get on. He would get his books and run alongside the bus. ” Eight miles every day, before school. Then   the old tree, and more running.  “He had. .. ” Montgomery’s eyes roamed for a moment, while he searched for the perfect word to describe the running boy, and everything he became. “He had dedication. ” On the wall of his home, Montgomery keeps a note Ali signed to “my first boss”. Montgomery had three children, and employed Ali to babysit them. His daughter Linda said she remembered the two parts of Ali’s personality  —   the playfulness and volume, underlaid by quiet focus. “Oh, he was funny,” she said. “He made us laugh and laugh. ” But when a boxing match came on the Montgomery family television, he would sit the children in front of it to watch, unmoving, studying, until the final bell.  As the radius of the young boxer’s reputation expanded, so did the ferocity of his opponents. On Grand Avenue people grinned and shook their heads, but hoped for his success. The city of Louisville and state of Kentucky, though, were more hostile. The Jim Crow laws were in full effect here, enforcing segregation in every corner of life.  There’s a story about Ali set in the early 1960s, after his triumph in the Rome Olympics. According to Ali biographer Thomas Hauser it’s not true, and the Muhammad Ali Center presents it as a legend. But it matters that   in Louisville repeat it with the conviction of faith: after his win, Ali was refused a seat at a   diner, and in his disillusionment he climbed a bridge and cast his gold medal into the Ohio river.  People here believe that story, polish and cherish that story, because it captures two things that are exactly true. Louisville, and the south at large, was an oppressive home for black people, who had not yet even secured the right to vote. And all of that  —   the established order, the granters of gold medals and diner seats  —   would be revealed as a fragile,   opponent by Louisville’s brash young man. He threw away more than medals, during the Vietnam war, when he refused to register for the draft. Boxing authorities suspended his license for more than three years  —   three of the most critical, profitable years in a young boxer’s career. Years that, as far as Ali knew, would not end. He could not have predicted history’s eventual view of America’s involvement in Vietnam.  “To be honest we all thought Muhammad was losing it,” his old friend Montgomery said. “It seemed crazy. What is he doing? It since then we have come around to understand it was his passion. Peace. ” As his radius expanded to encompass the globe, his paradoxical nature revealed itself again. The world’s greatest fighter had an underlying aversion to violence.  On Sunday afternoon in a plaza outside the Muhammad Ali Center, a crowd gathered to place flowers,   pictures, boxing gloves and trinkets at a memorial. One of them was Amal Salom, who was visiting from Iraq and wore a head scarf as she took photos with her iPad. She is 58, and said some of the first images she remembers beaming out from her family’s television were of Muhammad Ali in the ring. The sport astonished her  —   men pummeling each other  —   but she said her strongest memory of Ali was from 1990, when he visited her country. “He came to tell my president to not make war with Kuwait,” she said. She was referring to one of Ali’s least known achievements, and perhaps his most important. On the eve of the US bombardment of Baghdad, Ali spent time there negotiating with Saddam Hussein, trading stories with a man with an ego to match his own, without the underlying humor.  After a week he brought home 15 US citizens Hussein was holding hostage, and delivered them to their families.  “I remember he told us, ‘Peace’,” Salom said.  Lawrence Montgomery, Ali’s his old friend and first employer, was right. Not just Louisville. The world.

’Afghan Girl’ rejects offer to suspend deportation from Pakistan
An Afghan woman made famous by a photograph taken of her when she was 12 has turned down a   offer to suspend her deportation from Pakistan, a country she first moved to as a child refugee. Sharbat Gula instead plans to return to Afghanistan on Wednesday, where she will be hailed as a national heroine in a scheduled meeting with the country’s president, Ashraf Ghani. Gula, now 44, has become the unlikely focus of a tug of war between the Afghan and Pakistani governments following a backlash over her arrest in October and conviction for living illegally in Pakistan under a forged identity card. A court ordered she be deported after serving a   jail term and paying a fine of 110, 000 rupees (£850). Ijaz Khan, an academic at Peshawar University, said the arrest and trial had caused “deep embarrassment” for the government. “A lot of people are connecting the way she has been treated with refugees in general, who have been treated in a very   way,” he said.  Over the past year, Pakistan has dramatically stepped up its efforts to encourage the estimated 2 million Afghans living in the country to return home. Many refugees claim they have been harassed by police, who have used the crackdown as an opportunity to extort bribes. The campaign has undermined Pakistan’s   boasts about its generous hosting of one of the world’s largest refugee populations. Gula, who appeared as the   “Afghan Girl” on the front cover of National Geographic magazine in 1985, has been raising her four children alone after the death of her husband. She is in poor health and is being treated in a Peshawar hospital. At the time of the photograph, taken by Steve McCurry, she was living in one of the sprawling refugee camps that were home to Afghans who had fled to Pakistan to escape fighting between Islamist rebels and the Soviet   communist government in Kabul. She was found again in 2002 by National Geographic and given a stipend to live off, although there has been controversy in recent days over whether she received all of the money. News of her arrest drew sharp criticism from some Pakistani politicians, particularly from parties representing Pashtuns, the   ethnic group to which Gula belongs. “Targeting the most vulnerable refugee population has upset and embarrassed the people of Pakistan,” said Bushra Gohar, from the Awami National party. “Sharbat Gula’s case has exposed the poor treatment meted to the Afghan refugees in Pakistan. ” On Saturday, the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) the province where Gula was living and was arrested, offered to cancel her deportation. But family members said she had rejected the offer after initial confusion over paperwork a KP government functionary had asked her to sign that she thought was a hospital discharge notice. “It was an oath and affidavit saying that she wanted to stay in Pakistan but we prepared a fresh application saying she can’t wait to leave Pakistan,” said Naimat Khan, a relative who has been staying by her bedside at Lady Reading hospital in Peshawar. “She was grabbed from home and sent to jail so obviously she does not wish to live here in Pakistan any more,” he said. The family allege that she was targeted only after a local police officer learned she had money from selling her small house in Peshawar. A grand welcome is planned for her return to Afghanistan, where billboards with her photograph have been erected. After crossing into Afghanistan at the Torkham border post she is due to fly to Kabul for a meeting with Ghani. An Afghan government official said she will be given a house. Abubakar Siddique, a journalist from Radio Free Europe, said Gula’s case had provoked deep anger in Afghanistan, a country where   sentiment is already high. “This is an impoverished, vulnerable woman, treated harshly and detained after living in the country for 40 years,” he said. “It was seen as violating the Afghan notion of honour. ” The crackdown on refugees has come at a time when relations between the two neighbouring countries are in a deep trough, with Afghanistan furious at Pakistan’s refusal to crack down on the sanctuaries enjoyed by Taliban leaders inside its borders. Ghani has responded to Pakistan’s pressure on refugees by encouraging them to cross the border with a “grass is green in my land” public relations campaign. Despite the warm words there are serious doubts the Afghan government can cope with the huge influx of people, in addition to the large number of people displaced by fighting within the country.     million Afghans, many of them born in Pakistan, are expected to have moved to Afghanistan by the end of the year. Officials say the surge in numbers is due partly to the decision to increase the amount of money paid by the UN to those returning refugees who are “registered” to $400 (£323) a person.

Phyllis Schlafly’s legacy: ’She encouraged us to speak out and speak boldly’
Phyllis Schlafly, the    founder of the Eagle Forum who died on Monday evening, is best known for her grassroots movement that prevented ratification of the equal rights amendment in the 1970s. But conservative women say that it would be a mistake to think of her as solely involved or interested in countering the feminist agenda. They credit her reach as spreading far beyond that, to empowering women in the conservative movement, many of whom now lead their own national women’s groups whose areas of focus have broadened to include “free markets” “personal liberty” and “family values”. “It wasn’t a women’  cause that she led,” explained Lil Tuttle, the policy director at the conservative Claire Booth Luce Policy Institute. “It was a conservative cause. ” “She encouraged us to speak out and speak boldly,” Tuttle added. “She was a uniter in a lot of ways. ” Tuttle’s organization works to “prepare young women for conservative leadership” and promote conservative leaders. Its board members include Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, and Marji Ross, the president of the conservative Regnery publishing house. Its speakers bureau includes Bay Buchanan, the sister of conservative presidential candidate Pat Buchanan who, with Schlafly, forced the Republican party’s   platform to eliminate all references to exceptions in 1996 and Lila Rose, the founder of Live Action who, with conservative filmmaker James O’Keefe, participated in a series of stings against Planned Parenthood clinics. “Perhaps it is part of her legacy that conservative women found their voice,” mused Tuttle. “She certainly promoted activism. ” Schlafly got her start in politics writing about and campaigning for conservative candidate Barry Goldwater in 1964 because of her interest in opposing communism, and gained renown when she turned a grassroots movement of conservative women  —   many of whom were    mothers with little prior political activism  —   into a force that could not only credibly counter but defeat the ratification of the equal rights amendment. The ERA, which at one point had been part of both the Republican and Democratic party platforms and the culmination of decades of work by women’s rights campaigners, was just three states shy of ratification when Schlafly began her campaign against it in 1972. Galvanized by the US supreme court’s 1973 decision legalizing abortion in Roe v Wade, Schlafly and her volunteers began knocking on doors and delivering homemade baked goods to state legislators, claiming that a   amendment to the US constitution guaranteeing women equal rights would force women out of the home and into the workplace, add them to the ranks of military draftees and combat veterans, institute universal unisex bathrooms and force everyone to perform   marriages, among other then terrifying visions of the future. Schlafly won, defeating the ERA, but lived to see the US supreme court legalize   marriage, the US military accept women in combat roles, Congress poised to require women to register for the selective service, and even the issue of   bathrooms  —   the subject of her last published column  —   come to the fore. Nearly 60% of adult women now work outside the home, comprising 47% of the overall US workforce, and equal pay remains the top issue for working women, Americans tell pollsters. And though by the time Schlafly gained political prominence there were individual Republican women who had been elected to national office, her   efforts led to the founding of the Eagle Forum in 1975, an influential conservative organization with active state chapters often led by women.  Cathie Adams, who has served on the national board for several years and was the president of the Texas chapter of the Eagle Forum, said that Schlafly “would look across America and lift us up into leadership roles”. “It was a wonderful place to go learn, and Phyllis Schlafly was a wonderful mentor,” she added, noting that Schlafly and the Eagle Forum taught generations of women how to lobby and advocate for conservative causes at the state level. But Adams, Schlafly’s daughter, and several other board members are now embroiled in two lawsuits with the president of the organization over the Eagle Forum’s future and their continuing presence on the board.  Adams doesn’t plan to stop her work with the organization. “I’m still a member of the national board for which I’m most grateful,” she wrote in a statement. “It’s a position appointed by Phyllis Schlafly to continue her legacy into the future. ” Charlotte Hays, who serves as the cultural director of the   Independent Women’s Forum, acknowledged with an appreciative laugh that Schlafly “drove the feminists crazy”. But she agreed that Schlafly pioneered conservative women’s activism on more than just women’s issues. “She was involved in every movement of the Reagan years” and not just opposing the issues championed by feminists.  “She was just absolutely indomitable, absolutely essential,” said Hays. The Independent Women’s Forum focuses on the issues of “free markets and personal liberty” and counted Trump campaign manager Conway among its board members until she recently took a leave of absence, and Lynne Cheney, the wife of the former   among its board directors emeritae. In an interview with NPR, Penny Young Nance, the president and CEO of Concerned Women for America, credited Schlafly with her own organization’s success.  “I stand today on her shoulders in that I have a national platform to speak about the life issue and conservative issues,” she said. The CWA considers itself one of the frontline organizations in America’s ongoing culture war, promising to “bring Biblical principles into all levels of public policy” by focusing on issues of “the family, the sanctity of human life, religious liberty, education, sexual exploitation, national sovereignty, and support for Israel”.

Indians’ Marlon Byrd suspended for 162 games for drug violation
Marlon Byrd’s second strike with   drugs cost him a full season  —   and maybe his career. The Indians’ veteran outfielder was suspended 162 games without pay by Major League Baseball on Wednesday after testing positive for Ipamorelin, a growth hormone releasing peptide. Byrd’s lawyer Jay Reisinger said in a statement that Byrd tested positive because of a tainted supplement. Byrd won’t pursue an appeal, Reisinger said. “Marlon is devastated, but understands that he is responsible for the supplements he takes,” Reisinger said. It’s Byrd’s second violation of Major League Baseball’s Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. Shortly after he was released in 2012 by Boston, Byrd served a   suspension for testing positive for Tamoxifen, a medication used by body builders but also to treat breast cancer in women and men. In 2014, MLB increased its penalty for a second offense in 2014 from 100 games to a full season. A third suspension would result in a lifetime ban. In February, New York Mets pitcher Jenrry Meija became the first player to receive that sanction. Byrd, Meija and New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez are the only players to receive   suspensions. Even if he’s able stay clean, at 38, Byrd’s playing days appear over. He signed a   $1m contract as a free agent in March with Cleveland, which needed veteran outfield depth because both left fielder Michael Brantley and right fielder Lonnie Chisenhall were recovering from injuries. Byrd has been productive, batting . 270 with five homers and 19 RBIs in 34 games  —   mostly against  . He went 4 for 4 with a homer on Monday night against Texas, and then struck out three times in a loss Tuesday. He spent last season with Cincinnati and San Francisco. Byrd broke in with Philadelphia in 2002. He was an   in 2010 with the Chicago Cubs, one of 10 teams he’s played for. Following his first suspension, Byrd signed with the New York Mets in 2013. To replace Byrd on the roster, the Indians recalled outfielder Tyler Naquin from   Columbus.

‘We’re struggling to survive’: student debt still weighing down people over 30
People who live around Albany are used to having to explain that being from New York does not automatically mean that you’re from New York City. It can be annoying to be constantly explaining that unemployment is lower, housing is less expensive, there are definitely more people than cows and it is, after all, the center of the state’s government, even if New York City folks believe they’re the center of the universe. But for many   or fortysomething residents of the state capital, about 150 miles north of Manhattan, their student debt is still weighing them down, despite their having aged out of the twentysomething demographic that is the focus of public student debt sympathy.  “I pay $700 a month in student loans and I didn’t go to a fancy school,” explained Deanna Fox, 30, a writer who lives in Delanson, to a table full of people in their 30s and 40s gathered at the Riverfront Bar and Grille in Albany. “But there really wasn’t any opportunity as far as scholarships go: because I came from a very   family, I was too wealthy  —   even though we didn’t have much  —   to get a lot of   grants or scholarships, and wasn’t wealthy enough for my parents to pay for me to go to college out of their own pockets. “So I had to take out probably 75% of my funding for college as a loan, and most of it was private loans. ” “I also pay $700 in student loans a month,” said Emily Lemieux, a    museum professional living in Albany, “and I also didn’t go to fancy schools. ” Young millennials get more attention for their student loan burdens, but students faced such hefty burdens nearly 15 years earlier. Most   people in their 30s and early 40s went to college just as tuition rates began their meteoric climbs, and at or around the time when the federal government got out of the student loan game and turned over the origination of federally subsidized loans to private companies like Sallie Mae. These students entered the working world at either the end of the first tech bubble, shortly after   in the middle of two wars or at the start of the Great Recession.  This demographic is nearly as likely as millennials are to identify as political independents  —   especially in Albany, where about 30% of registered voters opt out of identifying as either Democrats or Republicans. That’s about average outside of the New York City area. Anna Varney, a   old account executive with the digital marketing company Overit, said: “I specifically went to [the State University of New York at] Albany so that I wouldn’t have student loans, so I limited all of my life choices, in a way, because I didn’t want student loans, because I knew that would limit me down the road. ” Varney’s colleague at Overit,    Jennifer Van Iderstyne, said, “There has been this slow rise in the cost of higher education that’s really happened over the last couple of decades to the point where it was burdensome on those of us who were in school 10 years ago. It’s an impossibility for those who are heading into it now. ” “We’re struggling to survive with those debts,” she added. “They don’t even have a chance. ” Latham resident Ben Backes, 35, who works in biotech, jumped in.  “The cost of college over that 15 years . .. has kept going up, and so it’s just like, it seems like you’re paddling upstream and the current is taking everybody with it. ” Fox was focused, too, on the opportunity costs of having to take out loans to fund her education. “I think about how I could put that money towards my own children’s education I could’ve put more of a down payment on my house that I bought,” she said. “You know, 70 years ago, people had limited choices but they also had more choices,” mused Fox. “You could become a farmer and it would pay for your family. You could become a doctor and you wouldn’t be mired down in debt for the rest of your life. ” Lemieux said: “I just think about my grandpa, who went to world war II and he came back and he went to work at GM. He had six kids and his wife never worked, and they had a summer home, and that was like, their whole life was his job. ” “Can you imagine having six kids on one income now, for somebody that didn’t go to college?” she asked. “You could have two people go to college and still . .. ” She trailed off, the meaning clear to everyone at the table.  But while almost everyone was in similar economic circumstances, Jeff Cutler, a    software engineer who lives in Cohoes, New York, felt there were others to blame besides college administrators. “I’m a bit later in my career than everybody else  —   I paid off my student loans, things like that  —   and I’m very concerned that the government is not working, or our politicians,” he said. “They have some ideas that have been fed to them over the years that they double down on, they triple down on. And so it’s really not addressing the concerns of average Americans. ” Van Iderstyne agreed. “I believe that the absence of term limits and the existence of being a politician as a lifetime career, for many of these people, leads them to make compromised decisions that are not really in the best interest of the people or fixing our problems,” she said.  “When you have half the government, half of our elected officials saying, ‘We don’t think government works, we want to get rid of government,’ how is government ever going to work?” asked Cutler. “I want it to work because I’m sending a quarter to a third of my salary there. I want it to work well!” One example of politicians’ failure to effectively govern is infrastructure, the group agreed. Van Iderstyne said: “I went to school at Suny [the State University of New York] Potsdam  —   that’s way up north, like, Suny Canada. There were, like, hundreds of miles up there that are basically inaccessible,” making it impossible to attract economic development that could sustain residents.  Fox said it’s not just physical accessibility that needs improvement. “There’s no internet, there’s no broadband, there’s no phone service,” she said. “Part of that you can’t really help you’re in the middle of the Adirondacks. But at the same time, I live 20 miles from here and I have no broadband. ” “It costs from a business standpoint I would say that the cost is prohibitive,” noted Backes. “But isn’t that why we have a federal government? To find some way to offset some of those costs, so that the people who choose to live in those areas, or can’t afford to get out of them  —   which, back to the education thing  —   they’d have some options?” “The fact is that it may not make sense, economic sense, to have broadband out where you are,” Cutler said. “However, from a standpoint of society, it’s very important to have that there. And for America in general, actually, ultimately it’s better for business  —   but the return on investment takes so long that a business might not be willing to do that. ” And that brought Cutler to one of his biggest concerns when he hears people advocating for a businessman to run the government. “Businesspeople have different concerns than what we need for effective government,” he said. “And the idea that a businessman will magically be able to solve all the problems  —   they’re not concerned about what the average person needs, they’re worried about numbers and profits and loss. ” “That’s exactly it!” exclaimed Backes. “Short term! Everything I feel like I’ve heard this election cycle, and every previous election cycle is, ‘Well, what are you going to do for me today?’  —   because that’s what’s on most people’s minds, because of their crippling debt. ” He added: “So the role of government, for me, is to have these   visions and to be able to help that. ” Fox added: “Having a businessman? Businesses are the ones that are financing campaigns. And so it seems like the general American populace is completely eradicated from the political process besides pandering to get their votes. ” “So many of the problems we’re talking about aren’t really made or broken on the presidential level,” said Van Iderstyne. “This is all in Congress. The president gets eight years, period, but your congressman can be there   years.  “So what’s his incentive to take a pay cut or to enact campaign finance reform that’s going to negatively affect his ability to make TV ads the next time around?” she asked. “I don’t trust any of them,” said Backes. “But I don’t cast my vote necessarily for the one I trust.  “For me, most of our elections really seem to come down to the lesser of two evils. The least of three,” he added. “Every election comes down to that,” said Varney. “I feel like it speaks to the character of the kind of people who are now attracted to politics,” said Van Iderstyne. “And also what you have to be and what you have to be willing to accept in terms of invasion and living your life in a fishbowl. ” “Unfortunately, it feels like the people who are the smartest people to solve those problems are too smart to get involved,” Fox piped up.  “I think it’s definitely become more polarized,” said Fox. “And I think that part of the problem, too, is that there hasn’t been a unifying issue that people really connect over. ”  “You would think the recession would have been a unifying issue you would think war against terrorism would be a unifying issue,” said Varney. “You would think mass shootings in our schools would be unifying issues,” said Van Iderstyne. “But they’re not. It’s too divisive. ” “There’s two ends of that discussion,” said Fox. “There’s ‘take away your guns’ or ‘keep your guns’. It’s seems like that’s the only thing that people can focus on. ” “It’s so black or white,” said Backes. “It’s not,” said Varney. “We could have nuance. ” Lemieux added: “In a school shooting, everyone doesn’t unify around getting a solution. They’re opposite. And then we having nothing. ”

Neil Young asks Obama to stop ’violent aggression’ at Dakota pipeline protest
Neil Young has called on President Barack Obama to intervene in the North Dakota pipeline standoff and criticized the “unnecessary and violent aggression” faced by protesters gathered at the Standing Rock site. In November, Young spent his 71st birthday performing for those at the Dakota Access pipeline protest site, and on Monday, in a long Facebook post, he requested Obama step in and “end the violence” against protesters. “The camp grows as winter comes,” he wrote together with the actor Daryl Hannah. “Standing in protection of our most vital life support systems, but also for the rightful preservation of Native American cultural ways and their sovereignty. ” “It is an awakening. All here together, with their   relatives, standing strong in the face of outrageous, unnecessary and violent aggression, on the part of militarized local and state law enforcement agencies and national guard, who are seemingly acting to protect the interests of the Dakota Access pipeline profiteers, at a cost of hundreds of thousands of   dollars, above all other expressed concerns. ” The musician then expressly appealed to the outgoing president to step in. “They stand for all that is good and they stay strong. We are calling upon you, President Barack Obama, to step in and end the violence against the peaceful water protectors at Standing Rock immediately. ” He then turned his attentions to   Donald Trump, who he refers to as the “surprise president” saying he brings a “bounty of opportunity” and his tenure will highlight the “great issues of our time”. “The surprise president claims he does [not] believe in climate science nor the threats it presents and his actions and words reflect that claim in tangible and dangerous ways,” he wrote. “Do not be intimidated by the surprise president’s cabinet appointees as they descend the golden escalator. Those who behave in racist ways are not your leaders. The golden tower is not yours. The White House is your house. ” In May, Young  —   who said he supported Bernie Sanders  —   allowed Trump to use his song Rockin’ in the Free World on the campaign trail, after initially saying he would not have allowed him to use it if he had been asked beforehand.  He ended the post with an appeal for people to be inspired by the Standing Rock protesters and stand up to the   administration.  “Be counted,” he wrote. “Be like our brothers and sisters at Standing Rock. Be there if you can. The progress we have made over 240 years as a nation, has always come first from the people. ”

Does your out-of-office reply say you’ll have ’limited access to email’? Dream on
My favorite literary form of the summer of 2016 is the automatic email    message. When future scholars of literature reflect on the way that we wrote in this tumultuous,   summer, what will they focus on? Perhaps it will be the way these utilitarian missives shifted towards a particular kind of magical thinking. “I’m away,” these    messages say, dropping into my inbox one after another, “and I have limited access to email. ” Limited access wasn’t always our collective ambition. Back in the late 90s and early 2000s, when   was but a dream for the masses, I recall a television commercial that often aired during my father’s favorite basketball games. A tropical beach, a    business executive kicking back with a clunky,   laptop. This was the exciting future of work: going somewhere beautiful but still being able to show everyone how important you were by bringing your 30lb ThinkPad, kicking back with a couple of spreadsheets and a piña colada. Now, a generation later, with unprecedented portability, connection, we feel the urge to note our limitations, or the ones that we’d like to envision that we have. We are  : with staring at screens, yes. But also with anticipation of how important we’ll feel when we look at our inbox after two, three hours away, note the stack of communiques at which we will sigh, with which we’ll reluctantly cope.  This is progress: the demonstration of status not through our ability to work wherever we go, but our inability to work. Our distance. Our ability to divide between the mundanity of    life and the sublimity of vacation. Our genuine and admirable devotion to personal time and space. Or at least our desire to have that devotion: our understanding that it is something to aim for. A wish. “Limited access to email,” we write, wilfully overlooking the existence of smartphones, playacting as if every hotel in the world doesn’t place the   password in our sweaty palms along with our room key cards. We are aloof, too good to feel a thrill at the buzzing notification that our high school friend has posted a    photo of the time that we all went to a water park.  This is magical thinking because everyone knows that with rare exceptions we are perfectly able to access our email whenever we feel like it. And we always want to, pretty much: when we announce via Twitter that we have too many emails, that we’re tired of them all, it’s because we want people to know of the demands on our time: our significance to other people, even when most of the other people are the Bed Bath and Beyond 20% off coupon. “Limited access to email” means: “I’m at my mom’s condo in Miami, but I could be in a treehouse in the Galapagos. ” It means: “I did not just look at my  ’s Instagram while eating cured meat for breakfast with my new, possibly less   boyfriend. ” It’s dignity, it’s distinction, it’s  . It’s “I have limited access to email but you, the person reading this email, have plenty of access to email. You have access to this very email that is telling you that I do not have access to email. ” But it’s also: “I have limited access to email and you have plenty of access to email, a wealth of access, a surfeit. But you know that I’m reading this, in case it’s important. Just in case. Just in case. ”

China: the new space superpower
At 8pm Beijing time on 25 June this year the tropical darkness over China’s Hainan province was temporarily banished by a blinding orange light. Accompanied by the thunderous roar of engines, a   rocket pushed itself into the sky. An increasing number of Chinese rockets have launched in the past few years but this one was significant for three reasons. It was the first launch of the new Long March 7 rocket, designed to help the Chinese place a   space station in orbit. It was the first liftoff from China’s newly constructed Wenchang launch complex, a   facility set to become the focus for Chinese space ambitions. And it was the first Chinese launch where tourists were encouraged to go along and watch. For a space programme that has long been shrouded in secrecy, it’s a major step. The Wenchang complex has been designed with large viewing areas, and in the sultry heat of that June night, tens of thousands of spectators stood cheering as the rocket began its 394km journey above the Earth and into orbit. “China is developing very rapidly into one of the major space players,” says Fabio Favata, head of the programme coordination office at the European Space Agency’s (ESA) directorate of science. China launched a pioneering “hack proof” quantum communication satellite, called Quantum Experiments at Space Scale, on 16 August from its older Jiuquan launch centre in the Gobi Desert. This is the first   satellite designed to investigate the weird quantum phenomenon called “entanglement” that so unnerved Albert Einstein he once called it “spooky”. In addition, China is preparing to launch another new rocket design, a new space station, an   telescope and a crewed mission before the year is out. China is estimated to spend around $6bn a year on its space programme. Although that is almost $1bn more than Russia, it is still a fraction of the American space budget, which is around $40bn a year. Despite its large budget, the US made only 19 successful space launches in 2013, compared with China’s 14 and Russia’s 31. With numbers like this, it is clear that China has arrived in space, and is set to become stronger. “You will see the Chinese quite visibly begin to match the capacity of the other spacefaring powers by 2020,” predicts Brian Harvey, space analyst and author of China in Space: The Great Leap Forward . Key to this will be the large manned space station, Tiangong, which they plan to have in orbit by then. Although not as physically large as the International Space Station America, Russia, Europe, Japan and other countries have been building and using since 1998, China’s space station will have a broadly similar capacity to perform science. “Science is becoming more and more important in the Chinese space programme,” says Wang Chi of the National Space Science Centre, Chinese Academy of Sciences. “We are not [just] satisfied with the achievements we have made in the fields of the space technology and space application. With the development of the Chinese space programme, we are trying to make contributions to human knowledge about the universe. ” Perhaps most impressive is the broad front on which the Chinese space programme is advancing. They are making strides in everything from human space flight to space science and planetary exploration. So do the Chinese want to take over space? Brian Harvey, space analyst and author of China in Space: The Great Leap Forward, believes the Chinese simply want to be seen as equals. “To use a Chinese phrase, I think they are wanting to bring their own mat to the table,” he says. “They are looking for equality, they want respect from the world’s space community. ” To that end, China’s biggest inroad has been made with the ESA through the space science programme. Soon after the turn of the century. ESA launched the Cluster mission to study   “space weather” and the electrical malfunctions this could cause on satellites. The Chinese were keen to learn more about space weather too and came to the European agency with a proposal: they would build extra satellites to enhance the Cluster mission if ESA would collaborate with them. “They understood that space weather was a key challenge as we rely more and more on technology in orbit,” says Christopher Carr, a physicist at Imperial College, London, who worked on the Cluster mission. ESA took care of the negotiations, allowing scientists, including Carr, to build the instruments unhindered. Although there were some differences in working methods that had to be ironed out, Carr says: “Overall it was an enjoyable collaboration. ” The Double Star mission was launched in 2003 and became China’s first scientific satellite. Cluster and Double Star have so far produced 2, 300   science papers. “That is an enormously successful, astonishing scientific output,” says Carr. China has gone from strength to strength. In December 2015, it launched the Dark Matter Particle Explorer, a satellite to look for the mysterious   matter that astronomers believe makes up a large fraction of the universe. This December, it plans to launch the Hard   Modulation Telescope to look for black holes. ESA and China are working together on a new mission  —   the Solar Wind Magnetosphere Ionosphere Link Explorer (Smile) which is slated for launch in 2021. The Chinese know that the value of these collaborations extends way beyond the science. “We are the newcomers in space science, and don’t have much experience,” says Wang Chi. “International collaborations are the shortcut for China to catch up with the world. In addition, science, especially space science, should be the responsibility of all humans around the globe. International collaboration is the effective way to obtain the maximum science return from any space mission. ” Favata agrees: “At ESA we collaborate with all major spacefaring nations. If Smile works well it is likely to be the pathfinder for future missions. ” In stark contrast is America, where there is a blanket ban on working with China that dates back years. The most obvious consequence of this has been the exclusion of China from the International Space Station. But far from slowing the Chinese down, the cold shoulder has actually speeded them up. Circling above us at the moment is the disused shell of China’s first space station. The   Tiangong 1 (Heavenly Palace) was launched on 29 September 2011 and hosted two   crews between 2012 and 2013. It is now abandoned and expected to   Earth’s atmosphere some time later this year. The Chinese will launch Tiangong 2, a second test station, next month. It will lead to a substantial orbital facility that will be in use by 2020. Known simply as Tiangong, it will be a key base for space research, with two large science modules joined together by a connecting service module. “They can do a lot of science on it. It will have a research capacity that the ISS didn’t reach nearly as quickly,” says Harvey. China is not planning to keep Tiangong all to itself. In June, it signed an agreement with the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs to open the station to experiments and astronauts from UN member states, specifically developing countries that find space too expensive at the moment. And running the experiments is where China’s astronaut programme comes in. There have been just five crewed space flights since 2003, and none at all since 2013. This is deliberate. “The idea is to take a significant step forward each time,” says Harvey, “and they’re not going to cut corners in terms of safety. ” For the next decade, the Tiangong space station is likely to be the principal destination. Their crew capsule is called Shenzhou (divine vessel). It looks similar to the Russian Soyuz modules probably because the Chinese bought Soyuz technology in the  . This same agreement saw the training of two Chinese astronauts at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre in Russia, who then returned to China and trained more astronauts themselves. Twelve Chinese astronauts have now been into space, including Liu Yang who became the first Chinese woman in space on Shenzhou 9 in 2012. Assuming the Tiangong 2 gets to orbit in September, then Shenzhou 11 will follow on 16 October, carrying two people whose identities have yet to be made public who are scheduled to spend a month on board. Looking to the future, the Chinese have already begun testing the larger replacement of the Shenzhou capsule. A   version flew on the June flight of the Long March 7 from Hainan. This larger vehicle will be capable of taking up to six crew to the full Tiangong space station or on missions to lunar orbit. It was the secondary payload, Aolong 1 (Roaming Dragon) on that launch that raised eyebrows, and stoked fears in some quarters that the civilian space programme is just a front for more covert operations. Aolong 1 has a robotic arm that can grab another satellite and guide it to burn up in Earth’s atmosphere. Officially, it is to remove space debris from orbit but it could also be used as a weapon, bringing down a rival’s satellite. Although this is true of any space debris removal system, doubts remain because China does not have an unblemished record in   weaponry. In 2007, the Chinese shot down one of their own orbiting spacecraft in what was probably a thinly veiled warning to America. Chinese concerns had been growing since 2002 when the US withdrew from 1972’s   Missile treaty, which paved the way for President George W Bush’s administration to develop   weapons systems. Since that time, concern over China’s militarisation of space has persisted in America. To others, however, that is little more than paranoia. “I think the military element in the Chinese space programme is overstated,” says Harvey. “It’s based on a misreading of the fact that their facilities are protected by the military. It’s a bit like saying the US military controlled the Apollo programme because the US navy took the returning astronauts out of the ocean. It doesn’t stand up. ” The military may not be in the driving seat, but it does launch about  % of China’s space missions. The Yaogan series of satellites are billed as remote sensing missions but analysts believe they are actually spy satellites. “I suspect they are entirely military missions. I’ve never seen any scientific papers from the Yaogan missions,” says Harvey. It is this American fear of China’s military that’s been driving the ban on collaboration, in particular the prevention of technologies being transferred to China by mistake. But now ESA has found a way to allow collaboration without the loss of control. It is “an elegant solution” says astrophysicist Graziella   at University College London, who is working on Smile. “China builds the basic spacecraft and sends it to Europe. ESA and its collaborators then attach the payload module, which holds the science instruments, and launches the mission. That way, no western tech goes to China. ” When it comes to rockets, China continues to develop a formidable arsenal of launch vehicles. Their rockets are called Long March and have been in development since the 1970s. The mainstay of their complement is gradually being replaced by the Long March 5, 6 and 7. While the Long March 7 in June was capable of lifting about 13 tonnes into low Earth orbit, it is the Long March 5 that analysts are really excited about. Due to make its maiden flight this autumn, it’s capable of lifting 25 tonnes to low Earth orbit, rivalling anything the Americans, Russians or Europeans currently have. It is not yet known what the Long March 5 will send into orbit, but the giant rocket’s second flight, scheduled for next year, will be carrying a very special cargo. It will be a robotic mission designed to land on the lunar surface and send back samples of moon rock to the Earth for Chinese scientists to analyse. The Chinese call their lunar exploration mission Chang’e, after the Chinese goddess of the moon. In December 2013 Chang’e 3 hit the headlines after it successfully deployed a small rover on the lunar surface. Despite some technical problems, it continued to return data until just a few weeks ago. Now, China plans to land a similar mission on the far side of the Moon in 2018. This will be a world first. “The Russians did think about such a mission in the 1970s but they never got much further than paper studies. This is real, the spacecraft is already built,” says Harvey. Also in the advanced planning stages is a rover to go to Mars. Pencilled in for launch in 2020, the Chinese Mars mission is going to find itself racing Nasa and the ESA, which have their own Mars rover missions launching that year too. But what about a human landing on the moon? There could be no bigger sign of Chinese competency than that. Sure, America did it almost 50 years ago but with each passing year Apollo seems to have less relevance to the modern exploration of space. Nasa has held back from committing to a new round of lunar landings. Russia and ESA would both like to go to the moon but can’t go it alone. The Chinese, however, seem to have the lunar surface in their sights. Designs for a Long March 9 rocket are currently being studied. With the first launch for the Long March 9 due in 2025, China could very well be in a position to land astronauts on the moon by 2030. This puts it roughly    with America, which currently plans to send astronauts to lunar orbit in 2023 but which has made no commitment to returning to the surface. Almost certainly this will be a flashpoint, but the ignition of a new space race would be a mistake. The Apollo programme of the 1960s cost the equivalent of hundreds of billions of dollars for little more than technological  . Better now, surely, to cooperate, spreading the cost and the benefit across the world. The Chinese space programme is gaining momentum year upon year. Its power lies not in unlimited funds but in carefully chosen projects, and the pursuit of clearly targeted goals  —   something the traditional space powers could learn from, especially when is comes to the crewed programmes. At present there is no agreement on what to do when the current agreements to use the International Space Station come to an end in 2024. With America continuing to talk about hugely expensive missions to Mars, but with no real plans or budget in place to do this, Russia and ESA could increasingly find that their space ambitions are more aligned with those of the Chinese. What is clear is that the Chinese space programme is more willing than ever to cooperate. With the signing of the UN agreement to host foreign experiments and eventually astronauts on their space station, the Chinese are opening up. It is of course hard to imagine Russia and in particular ESA abandoning Nasa altogether, but it is not inconceivable. In the aftermath of 2008’s credit crunch, Nasa pulled out of a number of   joint missions with Europe, including robotic Mars exploration and   observatories. This left ESA floundering for new partners, or frantically rescoping its missions. Increasingly, China will play a role in the international exploration of space, and although it is early days they have so far they have proved to be highly reliable. A seismic shift in space power is taking place. Europe could pivot either way or balance in the middle. Although most still talk about China “becoming” a space superpower, it is likely that history will record the tipping point as 25 June this year, when a giant rocket split the sky amid the cheers of more than 20, 000 tourists.

John Legend and this former prosecutor have one goal: keep teens out of prison
Adam Foss doesn’t look like your average prosecutor. He wears his hair in long dreadlocks that flow down to his ankles, and beaded bracelets ornate his wrists. He spent eight years as an assistant district attorney in Boston, but rather than focusing on high conviction rates or projecting a “tough on crime” attitude, he has been far more interested in alternatives to incarceration, and on keeping juvenile offenders out of prison. Foss’s efforts might have ended there, making tweaks on the fringes of a flawed system, but in 2015, he met singer John Legend, who is no stranger to activism. Now the two want to change the way prosecutors nationwide think about their job, and to recruit them into the war against mass incarceration.   “We are sending in droves our young men into a system that erases them from public view and public consideration,” Legend told the Guardian. “The only way we are going to slow that down is if we focus on holistic criminal justice reform and so much of that happens in the prosecutor’s office. ” The singer and songwriter spent much of last year on a tour of prisons around the country, visiting nine of them and sometimes performing for inmates. Through his organization Free America, Legend has been trying to bring attention to the over two million Americans in prison in order to change what he calls the “misguided” criminal justice policies leading to America having the largest prison population in the world.  Legend said he wasn’t surprised by much of what he saw in the prisons, but was definitely disturbed. “You begin to realize how much trauma and pain and abuse [the inmates] have been victims of themselves before they got to prison, and since they’ve been in prison. And you realize that it’s just a cycle that keeps repeating. ” When Legend’s Free America hosted a gathering for progressive prosecutors in 2015, Foss was there, and it was there his vision for a new organization, now named Prosecutor Integrity was born. Foss wants to use the platform not just to apply political pressure, but to train the nation’s prosecutors, especially young ones, on how to rethink the application of justice. “We’re always poking at the prisons and sentencing laws and police practices  —   and all of those things are important and need to be addressed, but the one lever that hasn’t really been addressed and will push everything over the edge is this one,” Foss said. Prosecutors in the US wield unrivaled influence over the incarceration of alleged criminals. They alone choose what to charge, what deals to make and in all but a few jurisdictions, these decisions are not subject to any oversight or guidelines beyond the elections that put them into office.  And because plea bargains are carried out away from the public eye, voters often have very few insights into how those offices work  —   at least until something goes wrong. In the words of Angela J Davis, a law professor at American University: “The unchecked discretion of prosecutors is extraordinary, and the mechanisms of accountability we have don’t work. ” Foss, who was born in Colombia and adopted by a Boston   family, left the Suffolk County DA’s office in March to focus on his new PI organization  . But while he was there, Foss tried to address that accountability gap with his own creative solutions. “What I was trying to do is look at each individual defendant as a case study. My first inclination was: ‘Can I keep you out of the criminal justice system all together?’ And if I couldn’t do that, how could I make it work both for you and for the the victim, the community and me?” In most large jurisdictions like Suffolk County, which encompasses the city of Boston, district attorneys have dozens or even hundreds of assistant DAs (ADAs) who handle the day to day details and decisions around cases. The DA himself may set priorities and policies for their staff to follow, but ADAs often have some latitude to affect justice however they see fit. These are the people Foss, Legend and Prosecutor Integrity want to reach and train to think more creatively about justice and the impacts of their decisions. In a TEDx talk Foss delivered in March, he describes a case from early in his career as an ADA involving an    black man he calls “Christopher” arrested for stealing 25 laptops from a Best Buy and selling them on the internet. Foss explained he decided not to charge the teenager because he “didn’t think branding him a felon for the rest of his life was the right answer. “With a criminal record and without a job, Christopher would be unable to find employment, education or stable housing. Without those protective factors in his life, Christopher would be more likely to commit further, more serious crime,” Foss said. “It is a terrible public safety outcome for the rest of us. ” Instead, Foss helped him recover most the sold computers, and come up with a plan to pay for the ones they couldn’t recover. He did community service and wrote about the impact of his actions. Six years later, Foss said, he encountered the young man again, and learned he had graduated from college and went on to become a manager at a Boston bank “and making a lot more money than me” Foss quipped.  Foss doesn’t think his approach is particularly novel, either. “I’m not this person that’s come up with this crazy idea  —   this is what we’re supposed to be doing,” Foss said.  Largely thanks to the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, the wind is now at Foss’s back. Enraged over prosecutor decisions in the police shooting deaths of Laquan McDonald and Tamir Rice, a popular groundswell led by activists pushed district attorneys out of office in Chicago and Cleveland during elections in March.  “These police killings of unarmed people is what’s making people pay attention to prosecutors, but in reality what they’re doing on a day to day basis and for so long is prosecuting ordinary citizens in ways that produce all kinds of injustices,” Davis said.  Davis wrote the book Arbitrary Justice about the   unilateral power of prosecutors nearly a decade ago and she is encouraged to see public attention shifting, but worries that the big city changeovers earlier this year speak more to a reactiveness over police killings than a popular movement committed to changing the day to day behavior of DAs. “Every single one of those   deaths last year was a tragedy,” Foss said, referring to those shot by police forces. “But if you think about the number of lives that are ruined by prosecutors, it’s some exponent of the number of people killed by police and we don’t get angry about that. ” According to Fordham law professor and researcher John Pfaff, prosecutors represent “a great untapped resource” for slowing prison admissions, and it’s not just theory. Pfaff said it can be readily demonstrated at work in New York and New Jersey, two states that have been decarcerating steadily for more than 15 years.  Since 2000, the two states have each decreased their prison populations by nearly 25% according to Department of Justice data. They are two of only three states, the other being California, to see   drops in incarceration over that span. By comparison, 45 states have actually increased their prison rolls over that time. The rise in incarceration started “as the states were adopting tougher sentencing laws” Pfaff said. “Lots of other states saw decreases in crime, and didn’t stop incarcerating. It’s clearly a decision on the part of DAs. ” The biggest challenge Foss is likely to face, beyond the inertia of the status quo, is fear. Voters have for decades stocked their districts with    prosecutors mainly because of it: the fear that criminals are out to hurt them, and the belief that locking them in cages is the only way to keep their communities safe. If new prosecutors come into office on a platform of compassion and diversion, how does the public react to what Foss calls “the  ” scenario where a diverted defendant commits a crime, especially a heinous or   one? “The truth is, the   happens every day in jail and yet no one says we should stop sending people to jail,” Foss said. Indeed, 95% of all inmates will leave prison at some point, allegedly rehabilitated, and some percentage of them, as many as 75% according to figures from the National Institute of Justice, will be arrested again.  “I’ll give you this: what I’m trying to do is different,” Foss said. “But is it any more dangerous than something we already know doesn’t work?”

Picasso and Rivera review – a lifelong conversation between artistic frenemies
Although they are both credited with inventing cubism, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque spent most of their lives arguing over top billing. Henri Matisse, who gave cubism its name when he derided Braque as a painter of “little cubes” feuded with Picasso from the day they were introduced by Gertrude Stein in 1906. For a long time, museums have mounted shows pairing Picasso with both artists, and many others, mainly because his name sells tickets, but also because of his ability to absorb new ideas and make them his own. Another of Picasso’s frenemies, Diego Rivera, shares top billing on Lacma’s winter show, Picasso and Rivera: Conversations Across Time, paralleling the European modern master with Mexico’s most revered muralist.   by Lacma CEO Michael Govan and Diana Magaloni, deputy director and director of the museum’s program for the art of the ancient Americas, the new show features more than 100 paintings and prints by both artists, as well as Iberian,   and Aztec objects illustrating separate pursuits of modernism first through cubism, followed by a return to the classics. Born only five years apart, Picasso and Rivera demonstrated prodigious talent from an early age. After only eight months at Spain’s most prestigious San Fernando Royal Academy, Picasso protested the rigidity of instruction by dropping out and moving to Paris. Rivera enrolled at the same school in 1907 and also moved to Paris in subsequent years, but it wasn’t until early 1914 that the two artists met and formed a fast friendship based on overlapping esthetic values and a common tongue. “Rivera says, ‘Picasso was painting The Poet and I came back and painted The Sailor.’ Then the story goes around again and he says, ‘Picasso complimented my Sailor at lunch but I see he has seven paintings.’ So (it’s clear) they’re working together,” Magaloni concludes after reading Rivera’s letters. A falling out occurred in August 1915, when Rivera accused Picasso of borrowing a technique for his composition Man Seated in Shrubbery that the former had used in his painting Zapatista Landscape. “He did steal, because he stole from everyone. Picasso had friendships and fallings out all the time, as all those artists did,” Govan says of the dispute. “The operating assumption is Rivera is five years younger, Rivera’s the follower. Picasso’s the inventor and leader. So this is just a twist on that story. ” Upon completion, Picasso’s painting was given a new title, Seated Man, after the artist painted over much of the work that used Rivera’s technique. Rivera was later ostracized by the cubists following an argument with poet Pierre Reverdy at a dinner hosted by the artist’s dealer, Leonce Rosenberg, who also represented Picasso.  Correspondence between Rivera and Picasso ended, but parallels in their work persisted even after Rivera returned to Mexico in 1921. Following the turmoil of the Mexican revolution on one side of the Atlantic and the first world war on the other, artists became less concerned with forging new paths, following what Jean Cocteau called le rappel a l’ordre (a return to order).  “What holds it together when everything’s broken? Your traditions,” is how Magaloni explains the esthetic shift of the time. In the case of Picasso, he had been exploring ancient art in modernist works as early as his 1906   referencing an Iberian   sculpture, Man Attacked by a Lion. After the war he again reverted to the classics with paintings such as 1923’s Woman in Blue Veil, a Greek figure in a typical mourning veil, commenting on the war’s destructive impact on Europe. The Minotaur became a fixture in a series of etchings made from   known as the Vollard Suite, and in the same period he illustrated an edition of Ovid’s Metamorphoses.  “There’s still a lot of rhetoric about modernism and throwing away the past that we use in art history and popular culture,” says Govan. “But so much of Picasso’s career is looking at classical art and ancient themes. The idea is to burst the cliches of modernity. ” Rivera did exactly that by turning to indigenous   works to comment on his homeland’s emergence in the modern age, and to promote   inspired by leftist ideas of the era. Indigenous figures became a hallmark of paintings such as Flower Day (1925) and Frida’s Friend (1931) while the Aztec goddess of the Earth, Coatlicue, emerged as a recurring figure in his later murals. Based on a   tall,   monolith, Coatlicue turns up as part of the machinery in an auto factory in 1933’s Detroit Industry. In 1939’s Pan American Unity: The Marriage of the Artistic Expression of the North and South of this Continent, Coatlicue is surrounded by Rivera’s wife, Frida Kahlo, peasants and the Founding Fathers, as well as Hitler and Stalin.  No doubt Rivera’s murals were an inspiration for Picasso’s epic canvas, Guernica, a nightmarish response to the 1937 bombing of the Basque town by Nazis. “You know he’s looking at Mexican muralists,” offers Govan. “So when he has to do something political, he’s drawing on that notion. ”  While classic Greek and Roman works have long been an influence on western art, indigenous American art was new terrain for modernism. Although the pairing of Picasso and Rivera is generally considered one of mentor and mentee, the new show demonstrates that the truth is hardly that simple. “What he did was help   the lopsidedness of our interest in ancient classical Greece or Rome versus ancient ” says Govan about Rivera’s often overlooked contribution to the equation. “I think there is bias. I won’t call it racism, but it’s a strong bias. ” Lacma means to help further correct that bias next year with Pacific Standard Time:   which will focus on Latino and Latin American art in concurrent shows among more than 70 museums and art institutions throughout southern California. “We’re in California, and Latin America and Asia feel closer. It’s a flatter playing field,” Govan says about the museum’s mission. “I think part of the point of this museum is to   rebalance and keep rethinking these things. ” Picasso and Rivera: Conversations Across Time  —   Los Angeles County Museum of Art, through 7 May 2017.

NFL week one round-up: Lions pull off wild win to foil Luck comeback
Matthew Stafford took advantage of one last chance Sunday and Matt Prater redeemed himself with a   field goal with eight seconds left to give the Detroit Lions a   victory at Indianapolis. Prater missed an extra point wide right with 4:04 left in the season opener, a miscue that nearly cost the Lions. Detroit won for only the second time in Indy, and it came just 37 seconds after it looked like Andrew Luck had rallied the Colts for an improbable   victory. It just wasn’t enough to avoid Indy’s third straight opening day loss in a wild finish. After Prater’s miss, Luck drove the Colts 75 yards and hooked up with Jack Doyle on a   TD pass with 37 seconds left. Adam Vinatieri’s extra point gave the Colts a   lead. This time, Stafford connected with receivers who took advantage of their speed against Indy’s thin secondary. He quickly got the Lions into position for Prater to atone for the earlier miss. Stafford was 31 of 39 for 340 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions. New York Giants   Dallas Cowboys, Eli Manning threw for three touchdowns, including the   score to Victor Cruz in his first game in nearly two years, and the New York Giants beat the Dallas Cowboys. The Giants won the debut of coach Ben McAdoo after 12 years and two Super Bowl titles under Tom Coughlin while spoiling the first game for Dallas’ Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott. Because of Tony Romo’s back injury, Prescott and Elliott were the first rookie   back combo to start an opener for the Cowboys since Roger Staubach and Calvin Hill in 1969. The game ended with Dallas in position for a roughly   field goal, but Terrance Williams didn’t get out of bounds after a catch and the clock ran out. Dan Bailey had four field goals, including two from more than 50 yards. Cruz, who missed most of 2014 with a knee injury and all of last season with a bad calf, broke free in the end zone for a   TD with six minutes remaining, prompting his trademark salsa dance. Randy Bullock, kicking because of Josh Brown’s   suspension, made the extra point for the lead after an earlier missed PAT. New York beat Dallas in an opener for the first time in nine tries. Hobbled by an ankle injury, Russell Wilson pulled off another   comeback, throwing a   touchdown pass to Doug Baldwin with 31 seconds left. The expected contenders in the NFC looked flawed offensively and buckled defensively in the fourth quarter, giving up an   touchdown drive to Ryan Tannehill that gave the Dolphins a   lead with 4:08 remaining. That’s when Wilson went to work, playing on a right ankle that twisted badly in the third quarter as he was sacked by Ndamukong Suh. Seattle converted    early in the drive on a   run by Christine Michael, but the big play was Wilson finding Baldwin for 22 yards on a crossing route on    near midfield. Wilson hit Baldwin in the corner of the end zone to give Seattle the lead. The extra point was partially blocked by Miami’s Jason Jones, but it didn’t matter. Aaron Rodgers threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score, leading the Green Bay Packers to a   victory against the Jacksonville Jaguars in the teams’ season. Rodgers looked every bit like, well, a   league MVP. He extended plays with his feet, escaped sacks and had precision accuracy all over the field. He completed 20 of 34 passes for 199 yards, with TD passes to Jordy Nelson and Davante Adams. He was sacked once for no yards and didn’t turn it over. He helped the Packers win their second opener in the last five years. This one came on a sweltering,   day that left some players cramping and others completely exhausted. Rodgers had no issues with the heat. More importantly for the Packers: neither did Nelson, who played his first game in more than a year. Nelson tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in the 2015 preseason and missed the entire regular season. The injury significantly impacted Rodgers, who lost his best deep threat, and the offense, which fell to 23rd in the league and tied for 25th in passing. Nelson finished with six receptions for 32 yards, including a   TD in the second quarter. Alex Smith dived for a touchdown on the first possession of overtime, completing the Kansas City Chiefs’ frantic rally from a     deficit to beat the San Diego Chargers  . Smith threw for 363 yards and two touchdowns, the second a   fade to Jeremy Maclin with just over nine minutes left in the fourth quarter that trimmed the Chiefs’ deficit to  . Cairo Santos kicked a   field goal a few minutes later, and after forcing a    Spencer Ware finished off a   drive with a touchdown plunge to knot it at 27. Kansas City needed 10 plays to march 75 yards in overtime, and Smith finished off one of the biggest comebacks in franchise history with his keeper from the   line on   . Carson Wentz had 278 yards passing and two touchdowns in a stellar NFL debut and the Philadelphia Eagles beat Robert Griffin III and the Cleveland Browns. Promoted from No3 quarterback to starter just eight days ago, the No2 overall pick from North Dakota State looked like a franchise player. Wentz played   football despite missing the last three preseason games with injured ribs. He finished 22 of 37 with a 101. 0 passer rating. A new quarterback (Griffin) and new coach (Hue Jackson) couldn’t help the Browns ( ) avoid losing their opener for the 12th straight season. Wentz threw a   TD pass to Jordan Matthews on the opening drive and tossed a perfect   TD pass down the right side to Nelson Agholor for a   lead in the third quarter. Wentz was slated to be inactive until the Eagles traded Sam Bradford to Minnesota earlier this month. He leapfrogged backup Chase Daniel on the depth chart, a bold move by rookie coach Doug Pederson that paid off in week one. Mike Nugent kicked a   field goal with 54 seconds left, lifting the Cincinnati Bengals to a     victory over the New York Jets. Andy Dalton threw for 366 yards and a touchdown to AJ Green, who caught 12 passes for 180 yards to help the Bengals beat the Jets for the first time in 10 meetings in New Jersey. Josh Shaw sealed the victory with an interception of Ryan Fitzpatrick in the closing seconds, helping Cincinnati improve to   in openers under coach Marvin Lewis. The Bengals won despite Dalton being sacked a   seven times, including 2. 5 by Leonard Williams and two by Steve McLendon. Nick Folk kicked a     field goal with 3:23 remaining, but Dalton marched the Bengals downfield for the winning drive. The first missed extra point in Folk’s career and a blocked   attempt came back to haunt the Jets. The Baltimore Ravens used a touchdown pass by Joe Flacco, two field goals and a throwback defensive performance to beat the Buffalo Bills. Against former defensive coordinator Rex Ryan, now Buffalo’s head coach, the Ravens limited the Bills to 160 yards and sacked former   Tyrod Taylor twice. That’s how Baltimore played defense under Ryan from   and that’s how they won the 2012 Super Bowl. Returning from a knee injury that ended his season last November, Flacco went 23 for 34 for 258 yards, including a   touchdown pass to newcomer Mike Wallace in the second quarter that put the Ravens ahead for good. That, plus field goals of 50 and 37 yards by Justin Tucker, was enough for Baltimore’s first   victory since 2012. David Carr hit Seth Roberts for a   touchdown with 47 seconds left, then connected with Michael Crabtree on a   conversion, and the Oakland Raiders pulled out a     victory over the New Orleans Saints. The Raiders had to overcome a     deficit and a     performance by Drew Brees. They also had to sweat out rookie kicker Wil Lutz’s last second field goal attempt from 61 yards, which narrowly missed wide left as the Superdome crowd briefly erupted before realizing the kick was no good. Brees eclipsed 400 yards passing for the 14th time in his career, tying Peyton Manning for the most such performances in NFL history. Carr finished with 319 yards and one touchdown passing. Jalen Richard ran 75 yards on his first NFL carry, and Amari Cooper caught Carr’s pass for a   conversion to briefly tie the game at 27 in the middle of the fourth quarter.  Brock Osweiler threw for 231 yards and two touchdowns in his debut with Houston to lead the Texans and their revamped offense to a   win over the Chicago Bears. Osweiler, who signed to a $72m contract from Denver in the offseason, was helped by an offense filled with playmakers. He completed passes to eight different receivers, led by rookie   pick Will Fuller, who became the first player in franchise history to have 100 yards receiving in a debut with 107 and a touchdown. DeAndre Hopkins added 54 yards and a score and running back Lamar Miller had 106 yards rushing in his first game with the Texans. Osweiler’s day started with a hiccup when he threw an interception on the first drive, but soon got going and looked comfortable after that. Jameis Winston bounced back from an early interception to throw four touchdown passes, and Tampa Bay claimed a winning record for the first since 2012 by opening the season with a   victory over the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday. Winston began his second year as a pro by going 23 of 33 for 281 yards, using just about every weapon at his disposal in the matchup between NFC South rivals. He hooked up with receiver Mike Evans, running back Charles Sims III and tight ends Austin   and Brandon Myers on scoring plays. The Falcons grabbed a   lead late in the first quarter after Winston’s pass for Vincent Jackson was picked off by Desmond Trufant, who returned it 13 yards to the Tampa Bay 9. There was a   between the quarterback and receiver, as Jackson broke outside while Winston’s threw to the inside. But Winston shook off that miscue, leading the Buccaneers on a     that culminated with a   TD pass to Myers. Eric Kendricks returned an interception 77 yards for a touchdown late in the third quarter and Danielle Hunter scored a   TD off a fumble return and the Minnesota Vikings beat the Tennessee Titans. The Vikings wound up forcing three turnovers in the span of just under seven minutes and also had two sacks. The defending NFC North champs needed the help from their defense in scoring 25 straight points after being shut out in the first half and Adrian Peterson, the NFL’s 2015 rushing leader, being smothered. Minnesota coach Mike Zimmer did his best to hide his starter at quarterback after the Vikings lost Teddy Bridgewater to a major knee injury, and after they traded their 2017   draft pick to Philadelphia for Sam Bradford.

New York sees first documented case of a woman spreading Zika via sex
A New York City woman infected her male partner with the Zika virus through sex, the first time    transmission of the germ has been documented. Zika is usually spread by mosquitoes, though health officials have known for some time that men can spread it through sex. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported the case on Friday and updated its advice for pregnant women. The CDC now advises such women to use protection if their partner has traveled to a   region, whether the partner is a man or a woman. The Zika virus causes only a mild illness, at worst, in most people. But infection during pregnancy can lead to severe   birth defects for the fetus. The New York woman was not pregnant. While this is the first documented case of a woman spreading Zika through sex, health experts say it is not surprising because most diseases that can be spread through sex can be spread by both men and women. It has probably been happening throughout the recent Zika outbreaks in Brazil, Latin America and elsewhere, though experts say it is probably not very common. On the day the New York woman returned from a trip to a   country, she had vaginal sex with her partner without a condom, health officials were told. She went to her doctor three days after her return, after developing common Zika symptoms such as fever, fatigue, rash and back pain. Tests showed Zika infection. Seven days after they had sex, her male partner developed similar symptoms. Two days later, he went to the same doctor. The doctor tested him even though he hadn’t traveled from a Zika outbreak area and no cases of    transmission had been reported. He tested positive for Zika. Both patients are in their 20s, but no other details about them were released, including where the woman traveled or when the infection started. Both have recovered, a CDC official said. The woman began menstruating the day after they had sex. Health officials say she may have spread the virus through vaginal fluid or menstrual blood. The primary concern about Zika infection is the threat to pregnancies, and health officials have issued cautions to pregnant women who have a male sex partner who may have been infected. The CDC has now altered its advice slightly, to account for lesbian couples that include a pregnant woman. The CDC is now recommending that “barrier methods” be used by all pregnant women who have a sex partner who lives in or travels to a Zika outbreak area. No    sexual transmission had been reported to date. Eleven countries, including the US, have reported cases of apparent sexual transmission of Zika virus from one person to another, according to the World Health Organization. At least 14 were people who are believed to have caught it from sex with travelers, among the more than 1, 300 people in the 50 states and the District of Columbia who have been found to have Zika. The rest caught the virus while traveling to Latin America, the Caribbean or other outbreak areas. Health officials say all or most of those travelers were probably infected through mosquito bites in the countries they were visiting. There have been no reports of mosquitoes spreading Zika in the continental US so far. Other research has hinted at the possibility of females spreading the virus through sex. In a study published last month, a team led by researchers at the University of Wisconsin detected Zika virus in the vaginal fluid of rhesus macaque monkeys. It was found for up to seven days after the monkeys were infected. And there was one report of Zika detected in the vaginal fluid of a woman in the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, a CDC official said. Some experts said the case isn’t surprising. Sexually transmitted diseases that spread from men to women also spread from women to men, said Dr John M Douglas Jr, a former CDC expert on sexually transmitted diseases who now oversees a local health department in Colorado.    transmission is considered far more likely than the other way around, experts said. One reason is that Zika virus has been found to linger in semen for more than two months, but is thought to stay in vaginal fluid no more than two weeks, said Dr John T Brooks, a CDC expert on sexually transmitted diseases who is part of the agency’s Zika response team. The case probably does not complicate efforts to fight the virus or show an important additional pathway for transmission, Brooks said, because    transmission is relatively difficult. In the New York case, for example, several factors lined up to allow the disease to spread. The couple had sex just before the woman developed symptoms, a time when the amount of virus in her body may have been particularly high.  They had sex just before her period started, so there may have been a small amount of early bleeding. And the man was uncircumcised, and uncircumcised men are considered at higher risk of catching sexually transmitted diseases.

US military admits killing two dozen Syrian civilians in July airstrike
The US military has admitted culpability for killing approximately two dozen civilians in a July airstrike outside the Syrian city of Manbij, then the scene of fierce fighting with Islamic State militants. By the Pentagon’s account, the strike, which hit the Syrian village of Tokhar near Manbij, represents the single worst incidence of civilian casualties in the entire US war against Isis. But human rights monitors believe the US military is still undercounting the death toll, which is substantially lower than the ranges those monitors have compiled.  The Syrian Network for Human Rights has listed, mostly by name, 98 men, women and children dead from the July airstrike. The   monitor Airwars, based in the UK, assesses civilian deaths in the strike to range between 73 and 203.  In a statement on Thursday, US central command (Centcom) said that an internal investigation had concluded that “up to 24” civilians died from the bombing.  Key details of the incident remain unclear: the attack at Tokhar, near Manbij, occurred in the early morning hours of 19 July, local time. Centcom listed the date of the strike as 18 July, while saying that a different 19 July strike allegation, this one near Aleppo, did not in fact happen. But it had previously acknowledged that the airstrike in question occurred.  Centcom said the civilian deaths resulted from Isis “interspers[ing]” civilians with its fighters at an area identified as a staging ground for a “counterattack” against US and proxy forces.  At the time, the two sides had been locked in weeks of fierce fighting for control of Manbij, a waypoint for Isis to exfiltrate terrorists through Turkey, and  —   for the US coalition  —   the last obstacle southward to Isis’ Syrian capital of Raqqa.  The US said the airstrike targeted the area and “inadvertently” killed the   alongside nearly 100 Isis militants. “Unknown to Coalition planners, civilians were moving around within the military staging area, even as other civilians in the nearby village had departed over the previous days,” Centcom said in its statement.  After various investigations into allegations of   casualties, Centcom now believes that the US has inadvertently killed 173 people to date in a war that has entered its third year.  But monitoring groups say that the US has systematically undercounted the civilian death toll of the war. “Our own research indicates at least 330 civilians died in these same events. Even when [Centcom] confirmed cases, there appears to be   on these incidents,” said Airwars’ Chris Woods. Woods said he was “very pleased” that Centcom acknowledged its role in the   strike, though he noted the confusion in dates as to when the strike occurred. But he considered the variance in casualty figures alarming. “How can we only have 24 killed by the coalition, when we have such substantial reporting of civilian casualties that day?” said Woods.

Hack attack on Democrats is the future face of war
Last month, it was discovered that the computer networks of the US Democratic National Committee (DNC) had been penetrated by two sets of intruders, who appear to have been unaware of one another’s activities. The hackers seem to have been able to do whatever they liked, including accessing the DNC’s email servers. As a result, some (perhaps most) DNC emails found their way into the public domain via a number of routes, including WikiLeaks. The leaked emails were embarrassing for the DNC in two ways: first, because they revealed that some of its staff had been trying to undermine senator Bernie Sanders, the radical politician who was challenging Hillary Clinton for the party’s nomination and second, because they revealed the lines of argument with which Democrats were intending to undermine Donald Trump when the election proper got under way. On 24 July, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, announced her resignation. The leaks caused outrage among Sanders’s supporters, who made their dissatisfaction abundantly clear on the opening day of a convention that was supposed to unanimously confirm Clinton as the party’s nomination for the presidency. So the hacking and the associated leaks had not only unhorsed the head of one of America’s two political parties but also disrupted Clinton’s nominating convention. Some hack, eh? Needless to say, it’s been dubbed Watergate 2. 0, in memory of the burglary of the DNC HQ in June 1972 by people working for Richard Nixon’s campaign team. And now, just as in 1972, the key questions are: who were the burglars? And what were their motives? A number of cybersecurity firms investigated the DNC hacks and concluded that the culprits were two agencies of the Russian government, one the FSB (successor to the KGB) the other Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU. A clinching piece of evidence linking the hack to the Russians was the existence of an internet address in the DNC malware that had also been found in a piece of malware used in a Russian attack on the German parliament’s servers. So it seems pretty clear that Putin’s lot were the burglars. But what were their motives? Here the conspiracy theories begin. As ever, chronology rules. On 15 June, the DNC strategy for handling Trump was leaked to the Smoking Gun, a website that specialises in publishing embarrassing legal documents, arrest records and police mugshots. On 17 June, WikiLeaks announced that it had mysteriously acquired an 88GB cache of documents that it had encrypted for “insurance” purposes. On 13 July, selected DNC emails were leaked to the Hill, a politics website. The Republican convention opened on 18 July, with delegates mocking the DNC’s plans for dealing with Trump. Then, on 23 July, WikiLeaks released nearly 20, 000 DNC emails, some of them embarrassing for Clinton because of what they reveal about DNC official views of Sanders. The next day, Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned and the day after that the Democratic convention opened, with Sanders’s supporters still furious about the DNC’s treatment of their hero. A key question in any criminal investigation is: who benefits? Looking at the above chronology, the answer is clear: Donald Trump. Which then leads to a second question: why would agencies of the Russian government wish to undermine Clinton and benefit her opponent? Here the conspiracy theories move up a gear. Trump has boasted of his admiration for Putin as a “strong” leader with whom he can do business. His admiration has been reciprocated by Putin. Trump has also made clear his disdain for Nato as an organisation that enables European nations to have security without paying their fair share of its costs. So if he were president and Putin made aggressive moves against the Baltic states, would he support a strong Nato response? Who knows? But if you were in Putin’s shoes, you’d regard Trump as clearly preferable to Clinton, who is an   American hawk. All of this is pure speculation. What is more interesting about the DNC hack, as Professor Thomas Rid of King’s College, London points out in his thoughtful analysis of the saga, is that it represents a significant shift in Russian military doctrine. They call it “new generation warfare” a mindset that significantly expands the definition of a military target and what qualify as military tactics. It’s an approach to conflict that’s “designed to manipulate the adversary’s picture of reality, misinform it, and eventually interfere with the   process of individuals, organisations, governments and societies”. Subtle interference in western elections fits neatly into that mindset. Welcome to the future.

Ed Sheeran sued for $20m by songwriters behind X Factor winner
Ed Sheeran’s 2014 summer hit Photograph is at the center of a new $20m lawsuit alleging that the  ’s ballad copies a song released by a winner of The X Factor. Attorney Richard Busch, who recently triumphed on behalf of Marvin Gaye’s family over the hit Blurred Lines, is representing the   songwriters Martin Harrington and Thomas Leonard. They say Sheeran’s Photograph “  ” copies their 2009 song Amazing. That song was released as the third single by Matt Cardle, winner of the 2010 season of The X Factor. Harrington and Leonard have also written songs for Kylie Minogue and Emma Bunton. Cardle is not a party to the lawsuit. Amazing got to No 84 in the UK, though it has generated more than 1m video plays on YouTube. However, the single’s success pales in comparison with that of Photograph, which as of 1 June had sold more than 3. 5m copies, according to the lawsuit. Sheeran’s song has more than 208m plays on YouTube, and is largely credited for elevating his profile to superstar status. Most recently, it was licensed for the romantic drama Me Before You. Harrington and Leonard claim in their lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in a Los Angeles federal court, that the similarities between the two songs are evident even to the untrained listener. “The chorus sections of Amazing and the infringing Photograph share 39 identical notes  —   meaning the notes are identical in pitch, rhythmic duration, and placement in the measure,” the lawsuit reads. “The songs’ similarities reach the very essence of the work,” it states. “The similarities go beyond substantial, which is itself sufficient to establish copyright infringement, and are in fact striking. The similarity of words, vocal style, vocal melody, melody, and rhythm are clear indicators, among other things, that Photograph copies Amazing. ” Harrington and Leonard allege in the lawsuit that they sought to resolve their copyright claims privately before going to court.  Sheeran had been accused of lifting from Amazing by some on social media since the song started making waves. Éire Creative, a   creative design, animation and editing studio, went so far as to publish a YouTube video in an effort to prove the songs’ similarities. The stakes for Sheeran could be high should the judge find against him. Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams, the composers of Blurred Lines, were required to pay $7. 2m. Though this was reduced on appeal, the Marvin Gaye estate now receives 50% of publishing and songwriting revenues from the song.  Sheeran’s representatives declined to comment.

Michael Cimino, director of The Deer Hunter and Heaven’s Gate, dies aged 77
Michael Cimino, the director of the Vietnam war classic The Deer Hunter and the infamous epic western Heaven’s Gate, has died. He was 77. Thierry Fremaux, the director of the Cannes film festival, tweeted the news on Saturday, saying: “Michael Cimino has died, in peace, surrounded by friends and the two women who loved him. We loved him too. ” Cimino directed eight films, starting in 1974 with the highly rated Clint Eastwood and Jeff   crime movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, for which he also wrote the screenplay. The Deer Hunter, a harrowing story of friends from working class Pennsylvania played by Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken, in which a young Meryl Streep also appears and her then fiancé John Cazale takes his final role, followed in 1978.  The film was a critical and commercial success. On its   in 2014, Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw saluted The Deer Hunter’s “combination of sulphurous   imagery, disillusion and patriotic melancholy”. “A simple,   fact slaps you in the face after watching The Deer Hunter,” Bradshaw wrote. “Vietnam was different to Iraq and Afghanistan in one vital respect: the soldiers were drafted. They had no choice. The idea of sacrifice permeates everything, along with the cruelty and horror. This is Cimino’s masterpiece. ” Heaven’s Gate (1980) starring Walken and Kris Kristofferson and loosely based on the Wyoming Johnson County war of   was a critical and commercial failure which hastened the demise of the United Artists studio and coloured the rest of Cimino’s career.  The film has since undergone something of a critical rehabilitation. In 2013, Bradshaw called it “colossally ambitious and mysteriously moving, with an unhurried, unforced pace, beautifully photographed by Vilmos Zsigmond” the cinematographer who died in January at the age of 85. Cimino’s other films included Desperate Hours (1990) a thriller starring Mickey Rourke and Anthony Hopkins, and the gangster film The Sicilian (1986) which was adapted from a novel by Godfather author Mario Puzo. In 2001 he published his only novel, Big Jane, a story of the 1950s and the Korean war. Speaking to the Guardian, he said of his ups and downs in film: “Hollywood has always been crazy. It’s controlled anarchy. But how can you loathe something that has given you so much?  “I wouldn’t have had the life I’ve had without movies. Anybody who says they’re bitter is sick in their soul. They’ve given up. ” On Saturday, the writer, producer and director Christopher McQuarrie, tweeted: “Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, The Deer Hunter and yes   …     Heaven’s Gate. Michael Cimino. May the rest of us do half as well. ” The director William Friedkin said: “I wish I had paid tribute to Michael Cimino while he was alive. He was an important and masterful film maker. We will always have his work. ”

Truman Capote’s ashes sold for $43,750
The ashes of In Cold Blood and Breakfast at Tiffany’s author Truman Capote have been sold at auction in Los Angeles for $43, 750 (£33, 800). Kept in a carved Japanese wooden box, the ashes belonged to the late Joanne Carson, wife of the former Tonight Show host Johnny Carson. According to vendor Julien’s Auctions, Carson, who died last year, said that owning the ashes “brought her great comfort”. She and Capote were good friends, and the celebrated writer died of liver disease at her mansion in   in 1984, at the age of 59. Julien’s Auctions president Darren Julien told the Guardian in August that “with some celebrities this wouldn’t be tasteful, but I know 100% he would love it”. “He loved to create press opportunities and to read his name in the paper. I think he would love it that he’s still grabbing headlines today,” Julien said. “Truman told Joanne that he didn’t want his ashes to sit on a shelf. So this is a different way of honouring his request. It is just furthering the adventures of Truman Capote. ” The auctioneer had given the ashes a starting price of $2, 000, but they ended up selling for the much higher price to an anonymous collector. “We had people from Russia, Germany, China, South America and here in the US who had interest in them,” Julien told CNN. “I anticipated it could sell for over $10, 000, but didn’t anticipate it going to $43, 750”. Along with his ashes, the clothes Capote was wearing at the time of his death were sold for $6, 400 and two lots of his prescription pill bottles went for a combined $9, 280.

Are we living through another 1930s?
Things are happening with   rapidity: Brexit, the Turkish coup, Islamist massacres in France, the surrounding of Aleppo, the nomination of Donald Trump. From the USA to France to   Britain, the high levels of public racism and xenophobia, reflected now in the outpourings of politicians with   poll ratings, have got people asking: is it a rerun of the 1930s? On the face of it, the similarities are real. Britain’s vote to leave the EU parallels its panicked decision to quit the gold standard in September 1931  —   the first major country to quit the global economic system. Labour’s incipient split mirrors the one that left the party out of power for 14 years. And of course the economic background  —   a depression and a banking crisis  —   has echoes in the present situation. But a proper study of the 1930s reveals our situation today to be better and more salvageable in many ways, although in one respect worse. Following the Wall Street crash of 1929, the economic downturn took hold in 1931, with the failure of banks on both sides of the Atlantic, the imposition of austerity measures on   economies, the resort to tariffs, currency blocks and economic nationalism. The fact that elites advocated mass unemployment, as a downward pressure on wages, created the firewood overtly militarised and genocidal fascist groups lit the spark. It took just two years from Hitler’s first electoral breakthrough in 1930 for the Nazi party to score 37% in an election. Then you get the     demonstration in Paris in 1934 the rising of the Asturian miners in Spain, put down by the army German rearmament beginning in 1935. The Spanish civil war starts in 1936  —   while, in the same year, workers in both France and the US stage mass occupations of factories, and Stalin begins the great purge. It is here that the 30s take their essential shape: the surrender of democracy, the certainty of war  —   and the march to mass civilian death. For us today, the single biggest positive difference is that we start from a globalised world economy. We begin from a qualitatively more interdependent economic system, in which autarky is widely understood  —   even by politicians who would like to try it  —   as suicide. It was this realisation that forced the disoriented elites at the London and Cannes G20 conferences in 2009 and 2011 to coordinate extraordinary stimulus measures to stave off a   breakdown. Those, myself included, who paced around the edges of these events declaring the action inadequate should admit  —   despite the inadequacy  —   that they acted in the right spirit. The elite rejected “ ” economics of the kind that plunged the US into depression and Germany into fascism. Everywhere, that is, except Europe  —   and, even in Europe,   extremism has been held at bay until now. The problem is, politically, we have in one sense gone beyond the 1930s. Force yourself to listen to the subtexts of social media: the organised hatred against black female actor Leslie Jones, the anonymous racism and misogyny, the habitual fusion of   and   hate. Force yourself  —   maybe just once  —   to watch what some people are watching every day: black kids murdered by US cops Syrian kids blown to pieces by Assad, or Russia or the US airforce bloggers crucified in public by Isis, the mangled bodies of French partygoers on the Nice seafront. When Franco’s troops took Badajoz, and put 2, 000 of its inhabitants against the wall in the early days of the Spanish civil war, the Wehrmacht’s military observer was so disgusted that he advised German troops should never be allowed to serve alongside Franco’s lest they become “brutalised”. Today, an entire generation of humanity has been brutalised  —   whether it experiences mass slaughter, rape and torture firsthand, or whether it simply sees the pictures and hears the stories. If you read any memoir from the 30s and the war years, there is almost always a moment of realisation: what a cadaver looks like that prisoners can be shot that the Geneva conventions may be flouted. Sadly, in sheer brutality, we are past the 1930s  —   and in the struggle between governments and civilian populations the Geneva conventions do not apply. The worst thing about the present  —   and millions of people feel it  —   is the momentum towards catharsis. It is impossible to imagine everything dying back to a boring stasis. When you watch Erdoğan’s goons marching lifelong democratic journalists to jails where, as Amnesty International reports, beatings, torture and rape are routine, it becomes possible to imagine these things happening in other nominal democracies. On the face of it, we have two things the 1930s lacked. We have billions of educated and literate brains on the planet and we have the concept of universal and inalienable human rights. When, at the start of this unrest, I read Stephane Hessel’s Indignez Vous! (Time for Outrage)  —   one of the pamphlets that inspired the Occupy protests  —   I wondered why he dwelt so long on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Hessel had been a French resistance fighter and helped write the 1948 declaration. In an address to the youth of the tent camps in 2008, he spends several long paragraphs explaining why they fought so hard for the word “universal” and not “international”: “That is how to forestall the argument for full sovereignty that a state likes to make when it is carrying out crimes against humanity on its soil. ” Hessel’s generation understood that  —   even if it were all a figleaf for US hegemony  —   a global and universal system of human rights would leave a lasting legacy. Today, when a journalist or NGO worker stumbles on the scene of a massacre, they think  —   if they have been trained right  —   about   for a court first, the sensational scoop second. So, no. This is not the 1930s with drones and trolls. We have  —   and must defend  —   a resilient global system. One glance at an uncensored social media timeline will tell you what happens if we let go of that.

Turkish border guards kill eight Syrian refugees – reports
Eight Syrian refugees have been shot dead by Turkish border guards as they tried to escape   northern Syria, a human rights watchdog has claimed. Three children, four women and one man were killed on Saturday night, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. It said a total of 60 Syrian refugees had been shot at the border since the start of the year.  Six of this weekend’s casualties were from the same family, said the observatory’s founder, Rami Abdelrahman. “I sent our activists to hospital there, we have video [of the corpses] but we haven’t published it because there are children [involved],” he said.  The Local Coordination Committees, a network of activists inside Syria, supported the claim, reporting that one of the children was as young as six. Syrian refugees have been making illegal crossings of the Turkish border as Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon have made it virtually impossible for them to leave Syria legally. There have been reports of shootings on the border since at least 2013, and rights groups fear that the number of incidents has increased since European countries, including Britain, began pressing Turkey to curb migration flows towards Europe late last year. Around 1 million refugees, roughly half of them Syrians, reached Europe from Turkey in the past two years. Turkey has promised to take back all those who reached Greece after 18 March. In recent months it has stopped Syrians refugees in Jordan and Lebanon from flying to Turkey without a visa. Some attribute the crackdown on Turkey’s Syrian border and the implementation of the new visa regime to the EU’s crackdown on arrivals from Turkey. “EU officials should recognise that their red light for refugees to enter the EU gives Turkey a green light to close its border, exacting a heavy price on   asylum seekers with nowhere else to go,” Human Rights Watch said after a previous round of border shootings in March. A senior Turkish official said Turkey was investigating the latest allegations of shootings but was “unable to independently verify the claims”.  The official added: “Turkey provides humanitarian assistance to displaced persons in northern Syria and follows an   policy, which means we admit refugees whose lives are under threat. ” Turkey is building a wall along its southern perimeter, making it harder for Syrians to reach safety. Turkish diplomats say this is due to fears over infiltration by Isis rather than any animosity towards refugees. Turkey hosts more Syrian refugees  —   2. 7 million  —   than the rest of the world combined, and more refugees  —   around 3 million  —   than any other country. Critics say Turkey does not make it easy for refugees on its territory. In legal terms, it treats them as temporary guests rather than as refugees with rights under the terms of the 1951 UN refugee convention.  Despite recent legislative changes, the vast majority of Syrians do not in practice have the right to work in Turkey. Syrian children can nominally go to Turkish schools, but in practice Unicef estimates that 325, 000   Syrians are not in education, and many of them are forced to participate in child labour. Amnesty and Human Rights Watch allege that Turkey has deported some Syrians back to northern Syria, where Isis, Syrian rebels, the Syrian government, an   franchise and Kurdish forces are all fighting for territory. Turkey denies the claims.

Should I replace a MacBook Air with a Windows laptop?
My first ever laptop was a MacBook Air. However, the logic board stopped working, and Apple was going to charge $600 to fix it. Technicians have told me it is not worth fixing. At this point in time I cannot afford to buy a new MacBook, so which PC laptop would you recommend? I am a third year social work student, and I won’t really be carrying it to class: it will mostly be used at home. I don’t run any special applications, and my budget is less than $1, 000. Esther, If you have $1, 000 to spend, then you can probably get a new 11in MacBook Air for $899 or a 13in MacBook Air for $999. You could even get a $1, 099 13in MacBook Pro for less, if you look for discount offers on Amazon or at a local store. Or you could get a Mac Mini and add your own keyboard and screen for less than $1, 000, though you would lose the portability of a laptop. First, check with your university or college to see if you qualify for any educational discounts on Apple products. Next, look at refurbished and   models. These tend to be expensive  —   Macs hold their value well  —   but you may get some of that back if you eBay your broken MacBook Air for “spares or repair”. While you can afford $899 for an 11in MacBook Air, that’s the minimum price. Expanding the memory to the recommended 8GB adds $100, while three years of Apple Care support would add another $249, bringing the total to $1, 248. For this price, you could buy five   Windows laptops and not worry about them breaking. However, this not a particularly good time to buy a Mac, because the current   is rather old and, despite last year’s refreshes, needs updating. The 13in MacBook Pro, mentioned above, hasn’t been redesigned since 2012, and the Mac mini design dates from 2010. The 11in MacBook Air still has a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels, with Mac fans waiting for Apple Retina screens. Except for the overpriced ($1, 299) MacBook, the MacRumors Buyer’s Guide rates them all “Don’t Buy”. The shortage of new models seems to have depressed Mac sales in the USA, but you can expect an upsurge when Apple rolls out some new ones, or just refreshes the old ones. After that, you may be able to pick up an older MacBook for less. Pro vs Air, The MacBook Air is aimed at people who need portability, and its performance is compromised. If you don’t need the portability, then I’d generally recommend a MacBook Pro instead. And while the cheapest   13in MacBook Pro can justifiably be dismissed for being overpriced and out of date, it does have some advantages. It’s the only surviving MacBook where you can easily replace the memory, the battery and the hard drive, and I think it’s the only one that still has a proper Ethernet port, Firewire, and a   DVD drive. With a 13in MacBook Pro, you can upgrade the memory for very little cost. You can swap the DVD drive for an SSD (  disk) and replace the battery and the logic board if they fail. Of course, if you can’t do those things yourself, a repair shop will do the job, and you won’t be wholly dependent on Apple. The 13in MacBook Pro’s reparability means it could outlast today’s soldered down,   designs. As you have only used a Mac, I’d urge you to stick with Mac if possible: people generally like what they know. Even if, one day, you came to prefer Windows 10, you would still have had to learn new ways do lots of things. Windows alternatives, There are two obvious approaches. The first would be to buy a very cheap Windows laptop to tide you over. In this case, your   aim would be to buy another Mac when new models appear   your finances improve. The second would be to buy a more powerful Windows laptop to use for several years. Very cheap Windows laptops tend to have Intel Atom Z3735F or similar   processors, 2GB of memory, and 32GB eMMC flash drives (roughly the equivalent of an SD card, not an SSD). An example is the Lenovo IdeaPad 100S with an 11. 6in screen, available from Amazon. com for $149. 65. Alternatives include the Asus EeeBook X205TA, which I’ve seen as low as $140, and the HP Stream 11, which you can get for around $179 from   etc. There’s also an HP Stream 13 with a 13. 3in screen. These 2GB laptops are the modern equivalent of netbooks, designed for casual use. They are much less powerful than your MacBook Air, but they can still run Microsoft Office  —   which you should be able to get free, as a student  —   and handle web browsing and email. Although they are short of storage space, you can add a 32GB or 64GB SD card, and you can save files to a cloud drive. Microsoft OneDrive access is built in, but you can use Apple’s iCloud, if you already have that. For a little more money, you could get a Windows 10 detachable or    with a   screen. These work as both laptops and tablets, running tablet apps downloaded from the Windows Store. I like the Asus T100Chi as it’s better made than most similar machines and has a “Full HD” touchscreen (1920 x 1200 pixels) for $188. 24. The HP Stream X360 is an alternative at $262. 92. If you shop around, you can find plenty of similar machines from Asus, HP and Lenovo with 11. 6in, 13. 3in, 14in and 15. 6in screens. The “best buy” may be whatever’s on special offer this week. Windows 10 laptops, “Proper” Windows laptops have at least 4GB of memory (which is fine for Windows 10) faster Intel Core processors, and either an SSD or a traditional 500GB or 1TB hard drive. These will perform more like your MacBook Air. They will run several programs at once, and support many more browser tabs without slowing down. They are also, of course, more expensive, but you will have to balance the price difference. For example, the Asus Zenbook UX305UA (or CA) is arguably a better laptop than the MacBook Air: you get a newer, better processor (2. 3GHz Core  ) a better screen with touch sensitivity, 8GB and a 256GB SSD for around $750, where the 13in MacBook Air costs $1, 119. But if you’re paying $750, you’re not far off the price of a   Mac. A compromise might be something like a Lenovo Yoga 710 with 11. 6in Full HD screen, 4GB of memory and 128GB SSD for $499. There are lots of versions of the Yoga 700 and HP Pavilion 13 around, and you can often pick up bargains. If you are willing to move up to a   15. 6in screen, the Asus X555LA is good value and looks quite  . You get an Intel Core   processor, 4GB of memory (expandable) a 1TB Hard Drive and DVD for $315. 36. Again, there are several other models with slightly different specifications. None of these laptops is as well made as a MacBook, and the trackpads and keyboards are rarely more than average, and they don’t run macOS. However, when at home, you can raise the screen to an ergonomic height and use them with an external USB keyboard and mouse. In practical terms, they’ll do the same job for a fraction of the price.

François Hollande: France has ’a problem with Islam’
The French president, François Hollande, has said his country has “a problem with Islam” and that there are too many illegal migrants arriving in France. He also suggested that today’s “veiled woman” could become a Marianne, the female symbol of the French republic, and attacked his rival Nicolas Sarkozy as “the little De Gaulle”. The controversial remarks are published in a   book, A President Should Not Say That: Secrets of Five Years in Office. Hollande, 62, also spoke of the women in his life and how his actor girlfriend, Julie Gayet, wanted to be de facto first lady of France, which he said was a “hot topic” between them. He admitted he is feeling lonely and betrayed in the Elysée Palace, where he sometimes feels like a “ghost”. The French leader, whose desperately low popularity ratings make it uncertain as to whether he will stand for a second term in office, made the comments during more than 60 interviews with Le Monde journalists Gérard Davet and Fabrice Lhomme.  The subjects covered range from Hollande’s dismay over the national football team and the new generation of players (“they’ve gone from badly educated kids to   stars with no preparation”) to his 2012 presidential rival Sarkozy, whom he described as “a Duracell bunny who is perpetually agitated” and full of “vulgarity and cynicism”. But Hollande confided that he would not hesitate to vote for Sarkozy if it was a choice between his predecessor and Marine Le Pen, the leadeer of the   Front National. It was his comments on Islam that could prove the most controversial. The book quotes Hollande saying: “It’s true there is a problem with Islam   …     and nobody doubts that. There’s a problem with Islam because Islam demands places (of worship) recognition. It’s not that Islam is a problem because it’s a religion that is in itself dangerous but because it wants to assert itself as a religion on the Republic. What might also be a problem is if Muslims don’t criticise acts of radicalisation, if imams behave in an   way. ” He added: “The veiled woman of today will be the Marianne of tomorrow   …     because, in a certain way, if we offer her the right conditions to blossom she will liberate herself from her veil and become a French woman, while remaining a believer if she wishes, capable of carrying with her an ideal . .. Ultimately, what are we betting on? That she will prefer freedom to subservience. Perhaps the veil is a kind of protection for her, but that tomorrow she will not need it in order to be reassured of her presence in society. ” Critics said the French president was  —   perhaps inadvertently  —   suggesting women in France who chose to wear veils were not French and preferred to be subservient. On immigration, Hollande told the authors: “I think there are too many arrivals, immigrants who shouldn’t be there   …     we teach them to speak French and then another group arrives and we have to start all over again. It never stops   …     so, at some point it has to stop. ” Laurent Wauquiez, president of the opposition   Les Républicains, accused Hollande of being “willing to barter the symbol of the French republic for political Islam”. He said Hollande was “selling off the most powerful symbols of the French republic on the cheap”. On French footballers, Hollande allegedly called some of them “guys from housing estates without bearings, without any values, who left France too early   …     they need weight training on their brains”. He said he did not want to officialise his relationship with Gayet, 44, who he described as “a fine girl” and admitted she was “suffering from this situation”. The president’s relationship with Gayet led to the break up with Valérie Trierweiler, a Paris Match journalist, for whom he left Socialist government minister Ségolène Royal, mother of his four children. Hollande said Trierweiler had an “obsession” with Royal, but he admitted: “The woman I am closest to is Ségolène   …     she is there when I need her. “What weighs heavily on me is not having a family life. I liked family life a lot   …     at the Elysée you cannot have a private life. There is no time to be happy. ”

In Washington, two black managers create a piece of baseball history
Late last fall, the Washington Nationals and Los Angeles Dodgers had seemingly settled on two white men to manage their teams. This wasn’t much a surprise. Despite league rules that demand clubs interview   candidates for their manager and general manager jobs, baseball teams almost never hire candidates of color. Owners and executives tend to hire people like themselves, and since most of the   are white, the people they put in charge of their teams are, too. Washington offered their manager’s job to former Padres manager Bud Black, who accepted it and immediately began negotiating a contract. Los Angeles went into their search with an apparent favoritism for Gabe Kapler, who had once played for team president Andrew Friedman in Tampa Bay. Each was seen as a smart choice Black the bright tactician who had been in charge of a bad team in San Diego, and Kapler versed in the contemporary ways of baseball thinking. But sometimes, baseball hirings don’t always go the way everyone expects. Black and the Nationals couldn’t agree on a deal, and the Dodgers interviewed a long list of candidates in addition to Kapler, and found they liked someone more than maybe they expected. When the Nats backed away from Black, they hired Dusty Baker. After the Dodgers ended their search, they came out with Dave Roberts. In a game where recent hiring patterns say teams are only trusting white managers to handle their players, the Nationals and Dodgers eventually picked African Americans. By season’s end, they were the only two   managers in the big leagues. Their teams also had two of the   records in baseball. The National League Division series between the Dodgers and Nats that starts Friday night features several appealing matchups: top starters Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer, excellent rookies Corey Seager and Trea Turner and the oversized personalities of Yasiel Puig and Bryce Harper. But, more importantly, for baseball, this will be the first time two black managers have opposed each other in a postseason series. And maybe that’s what the rest of the big league owners should be watching. “You know, hopefully it motivates other organizations to get some   managers, also to motivate other players that are playing now and former players that have managerial aspirations,” Baker said on Thursday at a press conference before the series. “It probably brings a lot of pride across America and not only   people but everybody. ” Baseball teams have never been good at employing minority managers or executives. But in an era of advanced metrics, where increasingly the front offices are filled with the graduates of elite colleges who favor analytical analysis in judging players, the opportunities for   candidates have become smaller. The new general managers are young, white, and are often hiring baseball versions of themselves. They interview   and Latino coaches but rarely hire them. Last year, there was one black manager in baseball, Seattle’s Lloyd McClendon. He was fired after just two years  —   and with a winning record  —   when the Mariners new   executive team took over and replaced him with Scott Servais, a former major league catcher whose approach mirrored management’s. The implication is that African Americans and Latinos don’t share the same zeal for numerical analysis as   white players. Several former managers are often whispered as examples. Frank Robinson, for instance. The Nationals first manager in Washington once glared with disgust when someone explained to him the concept of the   statistic Wins Against Replacement which measure’s how many victories a player provides over a fictional   player. “What kind of horseshit statistic is that!” Robinson thundered. And while Robinson did things that were out of the norm for a modern manager including letting his first base coach fill out the daily lineup card in exchange for a smoothie, he did have a mediocre Nats team in first place for much of his first season in Washington. He might not have liked to study on base percentages but he understood baseball players and how to relate to them. Baker, who has handled everyone from Barry Bonds to Harper, has always had the same ability to motivate. Today’s players and coaches all embrace some level of technology. And Roberts, who was Black’s bench coach in San Diego, is a perfect example of how ridiculous the assumption is that   coaches aren’t interested in analytics. He brilliantly manipulated   coaxing 91 wins out of a team that lost Kershaw for two months, had only one starting pitcher stay healthy the whole year and lost most of his   bench players to injury. He is a favorite to win manager of the year in the National League, not only for his maneuvering around statistics but for handling daily calamity as if such thing is normal. Baseball is a diverse game. In nearly every clubhouse, three languages are spoken. When owners and general managers hire men who look and think like themselves, they put their teams in the hands of men who might not relate to the life experiences of their African American and Latino players. These are managers who have never endured racist taunts or spent their first year in the minor leagues alone because they knew no English. Diversity in the manager’s office is a good thing. More teams need to understand this. Like Roberts, Baker had his own disasters to handle. The Nats lost their   pitcher Steven Strasburg in August, had   from Harper and Ryan Zimmerman and dealt with a   bullpen fiasco. Still they won 95 games. Yes, both teams have talent, both were expected to be playoff teams before the season started but they needed managers who could handle regular adversity to get them to this division series. Managing isn’t just about finding favorable matchups it’s about leading. Too often general managers look for clones of themselves instead of true leaders. More than anything, Baker and Roberts were leaders this season. “It’s important, and it doesn’t go unnoticed or ” Roberts said Thursday, about him and Baker being the first black managers to face each other in a series. The game’s only two African American managers are seven wins away from the World Series. The rest of baseball has no choice but to pay attention.

World leaders beware: a photo with Trump will expose your soul
You could get lost in that photo of Donald Trump and Mitt Romney, couldn’t you? Every time you look at it, another new detail rises to the surface and breaks your heart. The angle of Romney’s eyebrows. The   lurch in Trump’s neck. The bottle of wine in the background and the glasses of water on the table. The sensation that Trump has shoved away his plate of scallops and demanded that someone bring him a big bowl of Sugar Puffs and a mixing spoon. But it is Romney’s face that makes this such a fascinating picture. Look at it. There is no way on Earth that Romney expected the photo to be taken. He is, remember, the most     in the history of the United States. He looks like what you would get if you asked a beachside cartoonist on Martha’s Vineyard to draw a human version of a bald eagle. Yet here he is, three mouthfuls into a meal, looking sheepish and squirming as if he has just been caught in bed with another woman. If this photo had a caption, it would be: “Honey! What are you doing back so early?” We’re told that Trump is a master of distraction, that every time he tweets or barks or honks it is a carefully   ploy to keep our attention away from his hidden agenda. There will be those who claim that this photo is one such distraction. However, I cannot agree. It strikes so hard at the essence of what it is to be Romney  —   a failed presidential candidate so desperate for power in any form that he is willing to make a humiliatingly public display of affection towards a man he once called a fraud. And it is an aspect of Trump’s strategy that is vitally important to highlight. Trump does this over and over again. Forget about dealmaking or galvanising the white working class his greatest talent is his ability to make you reveal your true self in photographs. He is such an overt character, and inspires such polarised reaction, that people become totally incapable of hiding their feelings around him. This is my theory: if you’re a public figure of any description, history will remember only what you looked like when you were photographed with Trump. Romney  —   sagging and broken as though Trump has ambushed him with a mariachi band playing Tonight You Belong To Me on an orchestra of sex toys  —   is only one example. And you don’t have to look far for others. A year ago, for instance, Chris Christie was a genuine presidential contender: an   political heavyweight who, as governor of New Jersey, prided himself on his ability to push through ideas, even managing to unite the gaping political chasm between the left and the right as he did so. Close your eyes and think of him now, though. What do you see? You see a shaved bear, don’t you? You see someone   and concussed standing behind Trump like a hypnotised heavy from a 1960s episode of Batman. No matter what he does for the rest of his life, no matter how many orphanages he builds or diseases he cures, you will always remember Christie as a lumbering, clueless henchman. Why? Because someone took a photograph of him with Trump. It works for his opponents, too. Before he met Trump, Barack Obama was the model of cool positivity. He was young and powerful, cresting on a wave of strong opinion polls. He was “yes we can” he was “fired up, ready to go”. But that persona evaporated for ever during his first press conference with Trump. Youth abandoned him in that moment suddenly, he looked old and tired, like Danny Glover staggering around immediately before the White House is taken out by an oceanliner halfway through the film 2012. His true self was dragged to the surface by Trump. And then there is Nigel Farage, turned indelibly into a radioactive Mr Punch doll  —   albeit a radioactive Mr Punch doll with grey teeth and useless hands  —   because he was once in a lift with Trump and a camera. Worse still for Farage, their picture strips away any illusion that he was ever a patriotic iconoclast. Look at him. He looks like a competition winner who lost all bladder control because he got to meet an American off the telly. It must be excruciating. Romney, Christie, Obama and Farage have all unwittingly blundered into defining images  —   and all because they happened to be photographed in the same room as Trump. But what is terrible for them  —   nobody wants a legacy like that  —   could be great news for the rest of the world. Just wait until the first photocall at Trump’s inaugural G20 summit. In that moment, we’ll be given a perfect snapshot of the world. We will see exactly what truly beats in the hearts of our most powerful figures. Who is ashamed, who is sycophantic, who is angry all will be revealed, because Trump will be right there in the middle of it, sucking their souls to the surface and, let’s not kid ourselves, probably eating a bowl of Sugar Puffs with a mixing spoon.

US blacklists more Russian businessmen and companies over Crimea
The United States has blacklisted seven Russian businessmen and eight companies and government enterprises over Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the conflict in Ukraine, the US treasury said in a statement. Moscow described the move as a “hostile act. ”  The sanctions come a month before Barack Obama hands over power to   Donald Trump, who has praised the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and said it would be good if the two countries could get along. Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, the ExxonMobil CEO, Rex Tillerson, has opposed US sanctions on Russia, which awarded him a friendship medal in 2013.  In Tuesday’s statement, the US treasury named seven Russian men, six of whom it said were executives at Bank Rossiya or its affiliates ABR Management and Sobinbank. Bank Rossiya and Sobinbank were sanctioned in 2014, and ABR Management was sanctioned in 2016.  The seventh man, Yevgeniy Prigozhin, had “extensive business dealings” with the Russian defense ministry, the treasury department said.  The US actions bar American individuals or companies from dealing with the sanctioned people or companies.  In addition, the treasury department named 26 subsidiaries of Russian Agricultural Bank and gas producer Novatek, both of which had already been sanctioned in 2014. US sanctions on those companies are relatively narrow and prohibit Americans from dealing in certain kinds of debt with them.  Novatek is Russia’s largest   gas producer. Its chief executive and major shareholder is Leonid Mikhelson, one of Russia’s richest men. “Today’s action is in response to Russia’s unlawful occupation of Crimea and continued aggression in Ukraine,” John Smith, acting director of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control, said in a statement. “These targeted sanctions aim to maintain pressure on Russia by sustaining the costs of its occupation of Crimea and disrupting the activities of those who support the violence and instability in Ukraine. ” Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, told Tass news agency that the sanctions were hostile acts by the outgoing Obama administration and Russia would expand its sanctions lists against the US in response.  “We retain the right to choose the time, place and form of our responsive actions in a way that suits us,” Ryabkov told Tass.  Valentina Matviyenko, the speaker of the Federation Council, the upper house of parliament, told a news conference on Tuesday that Trump’s forthcoming arrival in the White House promised to create the conditions for better   relations.  Commenting on what she referred to as “  sanctions” Matviyenko, a close ally of Vladimir Putin, said she was sure that western sanctions would be eased or lifted altogether in 2017.

Lionel Messi scores hat-trick in Barcelona’s 7-0 thrashing of Celtic
“Better teams than us have found it difficult,” Brendan Rodgers said before this game, but even he cannot have imagined it would be quite this hard. Celtic’s opening night in this season’s Champions League was a long one, a goal coming inside the opening three minutes, another coming inside the closing three minutes and five more between them. Three for Leo Messi, two for Luis Suárez and one each for Neymar and Andrés Iniesta completed a destruction, Celtic’s worst ever defeat in this competition and Barcelona’s best win. No European   club has ever lost by more in this competition. For a manager who declared himself an “admirer of everything that Barcelona stand for” this was a painful demonstration of their qualities. Barcelona inflicted seven goals and a thousand cuts upon their visitors, not just playing the game in Celtic’s half but playing much of it inside their own area. If the first half was impressive, the second was cruel. By the end, a Moussa Dembélé penalty saved by   ter Stegen was long forgotten, buried beneath the football that engulfed Celtic. Rodgers admitted he felt helpless as he watched from the touchline. It started early from a corner, but not by the traditional route. Instead Neymar took it short to Jordi Alba, who gave it back to him out on the left touchline from where he cut back inside and, with the defence stepping out, turned the ball into the area for Messi to control and hit high into the top corner from the edge of the   box. The clock showed 2:45 this looked like being a long night for Celtic. Kolo Touré smashed one off his own post Messi slipped the ball through the legs of Nir Bitton to thump narrowly wide and Suárez slid in, inches from providing the finish to what was essentially a     with Messi. A pattern seemed to have been set early: Barcelona had the ball while Celtic ran after it, usually arriving too late. And yet, it was Ter Stegen who arrived late, on 22 minutes and momentarily gave life to this game. Scott Sinclair’s run began inside the centre circle and took him to the edge of the area, where he slipped the ball through to Dembélé. Out came Ter Stegen, bringing him down for a penalty. As the striker stood over the spot, the German goalkeeper performed star jumps, a bright   figure with even brighter yellow extremities. Then, he dived to his right and pushed the penalty away  . Rodgers lamented the opportunity lost and Barcelona soon raced out of sight. Rodgers had said Celtic’s opponents could find space even if you parked two   buses, and this was a good example. Messi, Neymar, Messi, Neymar, through tiny green and white gaps they went, back and forth, until Messi finished from barely a yard. Then Ivan Rakitic had one cleared off the line and Neymar was stopped by Dorus de Vries, although their pressing did occasionally allow an exit route and a neat combination released Kieran Tierney whose pass was finished by Sinclair, in an offside position. Three minutes into the second half, Barcelona had the third the real destruction had begun, Neymar curling in a  . If the score worried Rodgers the time probably did too: there was more of this to come. Neymar clipped in a cross for Iniesta, on as a substitute for Rakitic at   to do something very unlike Iniesta: he absolutely smashed the volley into the net. It was four now it would be five almost before they realised it. Barely 15 seconds passed between Celtic kicking off and the ball hitting their net. Again the pressure was high, the passing was crisp. Suárez pulled back for Messi to slide the ball in and complete a  . It was not that Barcelona were rattling off shots from all over the place it is not their way and they did not need to. Yes, Neymar had curled in from 25 yards and Iniesta had belted his, but Messi’s three came from a combined total of hardly 15 yards and the two goals that followed were from similar distances. Barcelona were slicing through Celtic, the moves not finished until they had virtually run out of pitch. Celtic might have been deep by design but Barcelona pushed them further and they could not find a way out. Suárez and his   barely let them breathe. Barcelona combined inside the area often. When, momentarily, the visitors stepped up, leaving space, Barcelona flooded into it with speed. Celtic may have regretted their passivity. Of the front three, only Suárez had not scored, “that beautiful man” Rodgers had called him and he soon remedied that when Neymar clipped the ball on to his chest by the corner of the   box. He controlled, turned and thumped the ball into the roof of the net. Six, then seven. Another short corner, Messi’s ball across and Suárez poked it in from close range.

Trump warned by Nato chief that ’going it alone is not an option’
Nato’s   has issued a dramatic warning to the US   Donald Trump: “Going it alone is not an option, either for Europe or for the United States. ” Writing exclusively in the Observer, the leader of the western military alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, claims the west faces its greatest security challenge in a generation. He pointedly recalls the blood spilled by Nato allies after they came to the aid of the US following the   attacks and warns that, rather than “deepening differences” between the 28 members, now is the time to “nurture what unites” under “strong American leadership”. In the months before his election, Trump described Nato as obsolete and raised questions over whether America under his leadership would come to the aid of a Nato ally under attack. Stoltenberg writes: “We face the greatest challenges to our security in a generation. This is no time to question the value of the partnership between Europe and the United States. “The only time Nato has invoked its   clause, that an attack on one is an attack on all, was in support of the United States after the   terrorist attacks. This was more than just a symbol. Nato went on to take charge of the operation in Afghanistan. Hundreds of thousands of European soldiers have served in Afghanistan since. And more than 1, 000 have paid the ultimate price in an operation that is a direct response to an attack against the United States. ” Stoltenberg, who is a former prime minister of Norway, concedes that America’s Nato allies need to increase contributions, a demand made by Trump during the presidential campaign. America accounts for 70% of Nato spending. But the head of Nato writes: “Naturally, we have our differences. But leaders on both sides of the Atlantic, and across the political spectrum, have always recognised the unique ties that bind us. Our proud history is one of common challenges overcome together. “It is all too easy to take the freedoms, security and prosperity we enjoy for granted. In these uncertain times we need strong American leadership, and we need Europeans to shoulder their fair share of the burden. But above all we need to recognise the value of the partnership between Europe and America. It remains indispensable. ” Stoltenberg’s passionate intervention, just days after Trump’s shock election to the White House, highlights the deep concerns within European military circles about the new American president. In July Trump had said that Nato was incapable of dealing with terrorism and that he would be willing to tell allies who did not “reimburse” America for its military protection: “Congratulations, you will be defending yourself. ” Stoltenberg, however, hits back, claiming that Nato is playing a “crucial role” in the fight against Islamic State, and in strengthening the capacity of partners in North Africa and the Middle East to combat terrorists. He also writes that it is Vladimir Putin’s Russia which has become more “assertive” in recent years, and that the tens of thousands of troops the country is amassing across its western border should be treated as a genuine threat to which the west must respond. Trump has claimed that he will be able to build a strong relationship with Putin, and has attacked those who have encouraged a deterioration in relations with the Kremlin. Stoltenberg writes: “We have implemented the biggest reinforcement of our collective defence since the cold war. And the United States has significantly strengthened its commitment to European security, deploying a new armoured brigade to eastern Europe and delivering equipment and supplies to support future reinforcements if needed. This is deterrence, not aggression. We do not seek to provoke a conflict, but to prevent a conflict. ” “Nato battalions numbering thousands of troops cannot be compared with Russian divisions numbering tens of thousands just across the border. Our response is defensive and proportionate. But it sends a clear and unmistakable message: an attack against one will be met by a response from all. ” Stoltenberg’s comments, stressing the vital importance of America in maintaining European security, will be widely seen as a sign of concern over earlier statements by European commission president   Juncker. Last week Juncker claimed the Americans “will not ensure the security of the Europeans in the long term. We have to do this ourselves. ” He added: “That is why we need a new start in the field of European defence, up to the goal of setting up a European army. ” Former foreign secretary Jack Straw said Juncker was guilty of “narcissism” and that such proposals would only push Trump away from Nato. “I think this is another example of serious error by Juncker,” he said. “Every time Juncker spoke during the referendum, he helped the Leave campaign. The EU wants to make a choice about whether it wants Nato to continue. What would be the purpose of a European defence force? It is a folie de grandeur, like other things the EU has done which has caused it to face its current existential crisis. It is frankly crackers. But it is illustrative of the weird and narcissistic world in which he operates. ” The Observer has, however, learned that France and Germany are planning to unveil proposals on European military integration in the coming weeks. Norbert Röttgen, chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the German Bundestag, said that greater defence cooperation was even more important following Trump’s election. He stressed that it was a key area in which the UK should agree to compromise during Brexit negotiations. “We see in recent days that these geopolitical dangers and insecurities have increased and there is one most important asset  —   and that is unity of the west and European unity,” he said. Nicole Ameline, a member of the French National Assembly’s foreign affairs committee, warned the world was now “more unpredictable” with Trump in the White House and called for the UK to play its part in a strengthened European defence structure, as an aid to Nato rather than an alternative. “We have to reinforce our security and to do that we need the UK,” she said. Meanwhile the Foreign Office has confirmed that Boris Johnson, who branded vocal European concern about the US election result a “  ” would not be attending an emergency EU foreign ministers’ meeting on Sunday to discuss Trump’s election.

Police arrest black people at higher rate in city where Philando Castile was shot
Nearly half of those arrested by police this year in the Minnesota area where a black man was fatally shot during a traffic stop are African American, according to an analysis of records released this week  —   a vastly disproportionate figure to the area’s small total black population. As of 3 July, roughly 47% of the arrests made in 2016 by Saint Anthony Village, Minnesota, police are of African Americans, according to a Guardian analysis of the records, and about 38% of the people arrested since 2011 were black. The records released by St Anthony officials in response to requests from multiple news outlets following following the death of    Philando Castile, who was shot and killed by an officer in the city of Falcon Heights, which contracts with the village for police coverage.  The data could raise questions about whether Castile was subjected to the biases of police officers who pulled him over on 6 July for an alleged broken tail light.  Though the population of the three communities policed by St Anthony is roughly 6. 5% African American, the data shows over 12% of citations issued by officers since 2011 have been to black individuals.  The figures could be higher, as some arrests and traffic citations listed in the records don’t mention an individual’s race. The village’s attorney said race wasn’t included when officers didn’t record it in an incident report. The records also show: Castile, a longtime school cafeteria worker, was no stranger to law enforcement. Indeed, state court records show that, since 2002, he was pulled over at least 50 times  —   almost three times a year. He was cited for several dozen minor traffic offenses, records show, but over half the violations he received were later dismissed. As Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds,   in the immediate aftermath of the shooting on Facebook, she stated that Castile complied with officer Jeronimo Yanez’s requests for identification.  “The officer said, ‘Don’t move,”’ Reynolds said in the video. “As he was putting his hands back up, the officer shot him in the arm four or five times. ” The attorney for Yanez, who is Latino, has said the officer was reacting to the presence of a gun, not Castile’s race.  Myron Orfield, a professor who has studied racial profiling with the Institute on Metropolitan Opportunity at the University of Minnesota Law School, said the St Anthony data was “consistent with the pattern of racial profiling” however, additional records were needed to say for sure. In part, Orfield said, it depended on the demographic breakdown of the driving population in the area. “But the fact there seems to be a disparate impact of the numbers is consistent with the patterns for profiling,” he told the Guardian. Orfield   a study in 2003 for the Minnesota legislature on racial profiling that analyzed information provided by 65 law enforcement agencies in the state, and found racial and ethnic biases played a role in traffic stop practices.  St Anthony didn’t participate, Orfield said, adding that suburbs surrounding the village had “pretty bad profiling”. “You could draw an inference for that one of the reasons [St Anthony] didn’t participate is they had a bad problem with profiling,” he said.  St Anthony’s police chief, Jon Mangseth, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Across the US, black motorists are more likely to be pulled over than white individuals, according to a US bureau of justice statistics study that reviewed 2011 data. The report found 13% of black motorists were pulled over in a traffic stop during their last contact with police, compared with 10% of white drivers.  Only 2% of white drivers were searched during a traffic stop, the report said, whereas 6% of black drivers were stopped and searched. The report also found 68% of black motorists believed the traffic stops were legitimate, compared with 84% of white drivers.  St Anthony’s attorney said that additional records related to the shooting  —   including narrative reports, and audio files  —   have been turned over to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which is handling the investigation.  The attorney added that additional data for traffic violations is being assembled and will be provided to news outlets “as soon as practicable”.

America’s problems aren’t Obama’s fault. They’re George W Bush’s
It’s George W Bush’s world, and we’re just living in it. Not Donald Trump’s. Not Hillary Clinton’s. Not even Barack Obama’s. No, the unhinged arguments at the heart of the 2016 presidential election are not really a debate about the legacy of the current occupant of the White House. They’re not about Obamacare, or the Recovery Act the Paris climate agreement or even the Iran nuclear deal. They are, at their heart, an unresolved argument about the world as the 43rd president defined it: for worse, for much worse, and then for better. If you’re the kind of person  —   on the left or right  —   who cannot hear the name George W Bush without foaming at the mouth, you should leave your comment or post your tweet right now. Because it’s time to take a sober look at a presidency bookended by the spectacular mass murder on 11 September 2001, and the spectacular financial meltdown of 2008. From the rise of Isis to mass surveillance from tax cuts for the wealthy to immigration reform from the excesses of Wall Street to the struggles of Main Street this election is taking place in a country that is still torn apart by the Bush years. Rahm Emanuel, Obama’s hyperkinetic first chief of staff, liked to say that President Bush had left them a   gift of a shit sandwich: two wars, the worst recession in living memory and a disastrous international reputation. But Bush also left them a path out from his own colossal disasters: the massive government bailout of the financial sector, and a Federal Reserve prepared to take unprecedented measures to bankroll the global economy. A drone war to kill terrorist targets without boots on the ground, and a more stable Iraq that could allow for a US withdrawal. While Obama got to work on his special sandwich, Bush’s Republican party is still stuck in the middle of it all. For the GOP can no more find its way out of the Bush debates than Britain’s Labour party can decide how to deal with the legacy of Tony Blair. The single most contentious issue riling the Republican party is immigration: an issue that derailed Bush’s presidency. After winning a second term, President Bush declared he enjoyed a considerable amount of political capital and would spend it on a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants. He failed, mostly thanks to the vocal, nativist opposition of   talk radio hosts and their equivalent in the House of Representatives. It was the revival of those reform efforts that Donald Trump skewered so effectively in the GOP primaries, as he demolished his three biggest foes: Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and, yes, Bush’s brother, Jeb. George W Bush  —   along with every other sane Republican  —   realized long ago that the Republican party had no future as a nativist rump, hostile to the   demographic bloc of voters in the country. It’s unclear whether Trump’s new management team can move their candidate into this space. Despite their   spin, Trump left the indelible impression that he would deploy a deportation force against all undocumented immigrants, especially the “murderers and rapists” he claimed Mexico was exporting to the US. The second most contentious issue of this election: how to treat Muslims and Arabs, and particularly Muslim Americans. In this area, Bush’s approach was vastly more enlightened than Trump’s, although it’s fair to say that Genghis Khan also crossed this low bar. Bush visited a mosque in Washington less than a week after the   attacks to declare that “Islam is peace” and that Muslim Americans “need to be treated with respect”. He added: “Women who cover their heads in this country must feel comfortable going outside their homes. ” (In those days it was hard to imagine a European country banning a burkini.) But you could also make the case that Bush stoked the politics of fear  —   especially in the 2002 and 2004 elections  —   that led directly to this point of peak Islamophobia. It was under Bush’s watch, just one year after his second inauguration, that the fever took over.  And it’s outlasted the war on terror, although Trump is doing his best to revive both. His party refuses to disown him for trashing a Muslim American family who lost a son in Iraq, or for wanting to close US borders to a billion Muslims. It cannot or will not condemn him for proposing to torture detainees, in direct breach of international laws of war. Republicans cannot say where they stand on the Bush spectrum of the war on terror. Trump naturally hates it, pretending to have opposed the war in Iraq, as well as Bush’s hostile turn against Russia. And the Republican foreign policy establishment hates Trump for all that and more. Before the Democrats feel too smug about the Bush conundrum, they should consider their own internal struggles. Much of the   battle was defined by the singular question of how to treat Wall Street: whether the bailout was justified and whether bank regulation went far enough. Many Sanders supporters remain opposed to Clinton because of her hawkish views on the Middle East. And for all their hatred of all things Bush, Democrats in Congress voted overwhelmingly with Republicans to stop President Obama from closing Guantánamo Bay. After eight years of an economic turnaround, we have yet to resolve the debate about rescuing Wall Street. After eight years of troop withdrawals, we are considering sending troops back to Iraq and maintain what looks like a lot like a permanent force in Afghanistan. After eight years of Obama, we have not escaped the legacy of George W Bush. And no matter who wins, we are unlikely to do so any time soon.

Texas officials vote against British firm’s plans for immigration detention center
An abrupt   has thwarted efforts by the British security firm Serco to open its first family detention center in Texas. Local officials unanimously voted this week against “entering contract agreements” with the company after at least a month of negotiations. Serco had lobbied Jim Wells County to help it enter the US detention market by opening a facility in a closed down nursing home that would hold 500 to 600 women and children facing deportation. This followed a year of lobbying at the federal level. “We wanted to make an informed decision that is best for everybody and we felt were not able to do that because of Serco’s limited time frame,” said judge Pedro Trevino Jr, the presiding member of the Jim Wells commissioners court.  “If something would change that could take us back and make us rethink it,” Trevino said. “It would have to be something solid. ” Trevino said he became concerned when Serco told him the facility would be used to house “whole families” including men. “Changing what they said in the beginning drew a red flag. I don’t think they were forthcoming. ” After first voting to consider the agreement last week, another commissioner voiced concern last Thursday when Serco representatives met with officials and residents to answer questions, and opponents gave examples of numerous scandals Serco had faced at its detention centers in the UK and Australia.  “We are not here to be inhumane,” said Precinct 1 Commissioner Margie Gonzalez. “[We] did not know about all of this. ”  ICE said a “decision to move forward with a request for proposal is pending” and that it is “still developing its acquisition strategy based on the responses the agency received to the request for information. ”   Serco did not respond to requests for comment.  Last week, Carlo Uchello,   Citizen Services Business Unit, told residents the company had been more transparent than its competitors, Geo Group and Corrections Corporation of America, who “are in other counties right now behind the scenes, not having town hall forums and planning to open facilities elsewhere. ”  Trevino said Serco had at first resisted the public hearing. ICE already has 3, 000 family detention beds available in Texas. In 2014 it entered an IGSA for a center with Geo Group and Karnes County, and modified its contract with the Corrections Corporation of America and the city Eloy, Arizona, to build the South Texas Residential Center in Dilley.  Although the deal has been halted for now, judge Trevino said Serco may continue trying to persuade Jim Wells County, or approach the town of San Diego, where the La Hacienda Nursing home is located. San Diego’s mayor pro tem was not available to comment.  Serco has promised 200 local jobs if the center is opened. But human rights advocates say the opportunity may not last if Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is elected president, since she has promised to end the practice of detaining families.  “This box they’re trying to sell you may have zero value in a few months because we might get a president who might say that family detention is over,” said Alejandro Caceres, an organizer with Grassroots Leadership, during last week’s meeting with residents.

Queen of Katwe review: Ugandan chess movie could be new Slumdog
Making a chess movie is a tricky move. Your first stumbling block is that, of all sports, this must be one of the most uncinematic  —   as well as the most baffling for the novice. Even those familiar with the queen’s gambit need a little while to take a look at a board in an apparently tense setup and assess its import for both players. Plus, on the big screen at least, the dramatis personae are rarely appealing. Traditionally, movie chess is the recourse of the brilliant but socially awkward male, who uses it to communicate when more common methods prove elusive. Such folk can be a struggle to root for, their victories and defeats wrapped up in psychological trauma and solitary childhoods. A case in point premiered at Toronto two years ago: Pawn Sacrifice, a   Bobby Fischer biopic with Tobey Maguire sweating over the bishops. But The Queen of Katwe has a trump card in its disarming heroine. It is easy to cheerlead for Phiona Mutesi (Madina Nalwanga) a   living in a Ugandan shanty town, whose life prospects seem to pick up considerably after she finds she has an unexpected knack for seeing eight moves ahead. She’s coached by Robert Katende (David Oyelowo) a local minister who runs a kids club when he’s not being the world’s most charming amateur footballer and loving husband. But it’s one of the great joys of the film that he never feels repellently saintly. Indeed as the closing credits indicate, in their charming intro to the   characters, the actual man is yet more endlessly generous. Anyway, the glass ceilings against which shock prodigy must crack her skull are more numerous than those facing the usual aspirant grandmaster. How will she muster the money to compete in a local schools competition  —   especially given she’s not actually in school? How will she juggle her studies with looking after her kid brother and flogging bread in the market? And how many people really make it when they can neither read nor  —   after another brother’s accident cleans them out of rent money  —   have a roof over their head?  Phiona’s other trouble is her mother: a fiercely protective single parent with understandable concerns about how her daughter will cope if and when disappointment comes. She’s played, against type, by Lupita Nyong’o, giving rippling pride and strictness to her first   role since 12 Years a Slave. The logic of making the character quite so bristly is vindicated in the   climax.  In fact for what is, in essence, a   Disney sports flick, there’s endless freshness and vivacity to Mira Nair’s picture  —   her best in years. The Slumdog settings are   well shot by Sean Bobbitt, and though it’s hard to attest to their authenticity, urban Africa is rarely this intimately drawn. Conflict with snooty public school kids might be a bit blunt, but it’s played for compassionate comedy, and The Queen of Katwe remains quite a challenging prospect for a mainstream mass market audience.  There’s one too many bits of basic chess lingo   into feelgood life mottos, yet the game itself often feels happily incidental to the narrative of the film  —   so you can understand the need to knit it in somehow. What’s instead key is the earnestness and the exuberance, executed with a conviction that makes this that rare thing: a kids hobby movie where something really is at stake.

Jeff Bezos on Peter Thiel: ’Seek revenge and you should dig two graves’
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has spoken out against Peter Thiel and in defense of Gawker, telling a Los Angeles audience: “Beautiful speech doesn’t need protection. Ugly speech needs protection. That’s where the rubber’s gonna meet the road. ” In reference to Peter Thiel’s recent efforts to punish critical reporters in court, he said: “Seek revenge and you should dig two graves, one for yourself.  “Is that really how you want to spend your time? As a public figure the best defense to speech that you don’t like is to develop a thick skin. ” At the Code Conference on Tuesday evening the Amazon founder went on to say that free speech was ensured both by the constitution and “cultural norms” implying that although Thiel could legally fund lawsuits against reporters, the PayPal   was violating American culture.  “Without norms . .. the constitution is just a piece of paper,” Bezos said. Bezos recommended that someone so offended by negative press ought to go stand on an urban street corner, watch people walk past, and try to imagine what they were thinking about. “I bet you none of them are thinking about you. ”  On Donald Trump’s threats against the media, Bezos, who bought the Washington Post in 2013, paraphrased Katharine Graham on how seriously he wants to defend free speech. “I’m very willing to let any of my body parts go through a big fat wringer if need be,” Bezos said. Bezos, immensely private and known for successful business but   workplaces, has over the past few years expanded far beyond his   empire to efforts across a range of industries: artificial intelligence with Alexa, space travel with Blue Origin, video with Amazon Studios and news with the Washington Post. Amazon stocks went up 67% in the past year. Under Bezos’s reign the Washington Post now publishes 500 stories a day (twice as many as the New York Times or BuzzFeed) and reports around 76 million monthly readers. His admiration for media has limits, though. Talking about why Amazon is investing in TV series like Transparent and The Man in the High Castle, he said simply: “When we win a Golden Globe it helps us sell more shoes. ” The conversation turned to his commercial space company Blue Origin. Established in 2000, Blue Origin launched and successfully landed its first rocket and capsule this April. Here, he drew a clear line between his work and Elon Musk’s efforts at SpaceX. Musk has said many times that he ultimately wants to colonize Mars, which he sees as eventually replacing Earth. Bezos instead wants to put the bad parts of Earth into space. “I don’t want a Plan B for Earth,” he said. He said he envisions a system in which space is where heavy,   industry happens, while Earth is just for people: “I think you go to space to save Earth. “All heavy industry will be moved off Earth,” he said. “Earth will be zoned residential and light industrial. ” Looking for a better planet than Earth was misguided, he said. “Let me assure you, this is the best planet. ” An Amazon spokesman disputed the description of the company as a   workplace.

Urban Outfitters settles with Navajo Nation after illegally using tribe’s name
Urban Outfitters reached a settlement with the Navajo Nation after illegally using the tribe’s name for a collection that included “Navajo hipster panties” and a “Navajo print flask”. The lawsuit was brought against the fashion company in 2012, though it had used the name since 2001. The company claimed that the Navajo should have known that the name had been used to adorn jewelry and clothing for that time, according to the Farmington Daily Times, but a federal judge dismissed their motion in April 2016. Urban Outfitters has long attracted controversy for what many see as cultural appropriation, including for selling   keffiyehs as “  woven scarf” and a range of tchotchkes, duvet covers and clothing featuring the Hindu god Ganesh, which was taken down after complaints according to the Philadelphia City Paper. In a letter to Urban Outfitters CEO Glen Senk when the company first launched the Navajo line, Sasha Houston Brown of the Santee Sioux Nation said the collection was distasteful and demeaning. “There is nothing honorable or historically appreciative in selling items such as the Navajo Print Fabric Wrapped Flask, Peace Treaty Feather Necklace, Staring at Stars Skull Native Headdress   or the Navajo Hipster Panty,” she wrote.  “These and the dozens of other tacky products you are currently selling referencing Native America make a mockery of our identity and unique cultures. ” The tribe registered the name Navajo as a trademark in 1943, according to court documents.  In a press release Thursday, Navajo Nation president Russell Bagaye said: “We applaud [Urban Outfitters] for acknowledging the validity of the Navajo Nation trademark and are glad we have settled this matter. ” “We expect that any company considering the use of the Navajo name, or our designs or motifs, will ask us for our permission,” he added. Both sides settled for an undisclosed amount but have entered into a “supply and license agreement” which says that the Navajo and Urban Outfitters plan to collaborate on a line of Native American jewelry. “We are pleased we’ve reached an agreement with the Navajo Nation,” said Urban Outfitters general counsel Azeez Hayne in a statement. “We take the rights of artists and designers seriously, both in protecting our own and in respecting the rights of others. ”  “As a company [Urban Outfitters] has long been inspired by the style of Navajo and other American Indian artists and looks forward to the opportunity to work with them on future collaborations,” he continued.

Michelle Obama data breach: purported scan of first lady’s passport appears online
The White House is looking into a cyber breach after what appeared to be a scan of first lady Michelle Obama’s passport was posted online. The fresh disclosures, which included emails to and from White House staff, raised further concerns about the security of sensitive systems following a string of breaches affecting government agencies, private companies and the Democratic National Committee. Though officials declined to say whether the disclosures were authentic, there were no immediate reasons to suspect they were not. The US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, said it was “something that we are looking into”. The US Secret Service, responsible for the first lady’s safety, also expressed concern. Yahoo said Thursday hackers stole personal information from 500m accounts, including birth dates, hashed passwords and security answers used to verify an account holder’s identity. The internet company attributed the breach to a “  actor”. Obama’s information was part of a batch of emails spanning from February 2015 to July 2016 and purportedly hacked from the Gmail account of a White House “advance” staffer, responsible for logistics for official trips. The breach included the photo page of her passport, including passport number, birthdate and place of birth  —   most of which is public information. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said officials were taking a “close look” at what happened. While emphasizing the need for government workers to be cautious with cyber security, he sought to downplay concerns by pointing out that the employee whose email was apparently hacked was a contract worker rather than a permanent member of the president’s staff. “At this point I cannot announce any sort of conclusion that’s been reached about the individual or individuals that may have been responsible for the cyber breach that resulted in this information being leaked,” Earnest said. The Secret Service didn’t say whether it had opened a formal investigation, but confirmed it was aware of the “alleged email hacking”. “The Secret Service is concerned any time unauthorized information that might pertain to one of the individuals we protect, or our operations, is allegedly disclosed,” said its communications director, Cathy Milhoan. The first lady’s office declined to comment. The information was posted on DCLeaks. com, the same website where former secretary of state Colin Powell’s private emails were recently disclosed. The site says its goal is to expose the misuse of political power, and has been alleged to be an outlet for hackers tied to Russian intelligence groups.

The week’s best podcasts: You Must Remember This, Embedded, Radiolab
You Must Remember This looks back at one of the most fascinating characters from   Hollywood: Elia Kazan. In 1952, the director of celebrated films such as A Streetcar Named Desire and On the Waterfront went before Congress and named the names of supposed communists in Hollywood. His words destroyed careers due to blacklisting and left a black mark on his own legacy, too. It is an important story of zealotry and fear gone awry, with plenty of echoes today. To mark 25 years of Nickelodeon animation, the network debuted a new podcast offering a glimpse into the secretive world of animation. The aptly named Nickelodeon Animation Podcast is hosted by Geek and Sundry’s Hector Navarro and features interviews with the creators of your childhood memories, like Chris Savino, who worked on The Ren  Stimpy Show the animators of Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Legend Of Korra and Billy West, who has voiced some of the most famous animated characters, including Doug Funny, Elmer Fudd, Futurama’s Philip Fry and Dr Zoidberg, Invader Zim’s Zim and many, many more. Forthcoming shows will feature the people behind Rugrats, Hey Arnold, Doug, SpongeBob SquarePants, CatDog and even the relative newcomer Bob’s Burgers.  Earlier this month, Kelly McEvers stopped by Longform to talk about her mandatory listening podcast, Embedded. The conversation is an interesting peek behind the curtain of podcasting.  Hello From the Magic Tavern, one of the Guardian’s best new podcasts of 2015, continues to shine a light on the fascinating inhabitants of the magical land of Foon, where the animals talk even if you really wish they wouldn’t. This week, the wizard Jamillious the Mauve stops by to talk to Arnie, Chunt and Usidore.  Over on Spontaneanation, Paul F Tompkins teams up with Matt Gourley, Amanda Lund and Janet Varney for an improvised story set in an Ikea in Narnia. It’s a masterpiece in surreal storytelling. The author Paul Theroux stopped by the Travel with Rick Steves podcast to talk about touring the back roads of the southern US. Theroux has been featured on the show before, and his knowledge of the deep south is vivid and insightful, which is fitting considering he literally wrote the book on the topic.  A new season of ABC’s The Bachelorette means new instalments of Juliet Litman’s Bachelor Party, which rose from the ashes of her Grantland (RIP) series The Right Reasons. As part of The Ringer’s Channel 33 show, each week, as Bachelorette JoJo Fletcher doles out roses on her way towards true love, Litman and guests analyze the show with a gimlet eye and a true fan’s elan. Speaking of The Ringer, founder Bill Simmons recently tweeted that his podcast network, launched on 1 October, is poised to exceed 50m downloads this week. Radiolab is set to embark on a new series, which promises to look behind the decisions of the supreme court for a glimpse into the     and personal effects of the rulings made by the nine (currently eight) men and women who make up the bench. More Perfect debuts on 2 June.  Reports of Another Round’s impending demise may have been hasty. While it’s true that Heben Nigatu is leaving her job as a senior editor at Buzzfeed for a spot on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, according to BuzzFeed’s audio director (and producer of Another Round) Eleanor Kagan, while an exact plan is still TBD, they are all determined to keep the show going.  “We’re working on ways that we can keep Another Round going because we believe in it, love making it, and love the community it’s created,” said Kagan. “As Heben settles into her new job, we’ll work on finding the best way to do the show with her schedule. We’re excited to continue the work we’ve been doing, and new episodes aren’t stopping any time soon. ”  Fans should keep their fingers crossed that scheduling conflicts won’t take down one of the best podcasts around. Fans of serialized thrillers such as Tanis, Small Town Horror and Limetown should check out Archive 81, which has just released its fourth episode. The story follows Dan, an archivist working to catalogue the recordings made on behalf of the Housing Historical Committee of New York State. It’s standard work for an archivist, but as he listens to the tapes, a mystery unfurls and he’s left wondering what happened to the woman on the tapes and the mysterious apartment building she was surveying. According to producer Marc Sollinger, he and his   Daniel Powell, created the series based on real life events, sort of.  “Dan  —   my   not the character based on and voiced by Dan  —   is actually the manager of a sound effects library,” said Sollinger. “His job mostly involves being alone and listening to weird sounds all day.  “As we were brainstorming ideas for audio projects to work on, that got mixed in with some of my thoughts about the inherent     nature of capitalism, the fact that we were both experiencing the strange loneliness of big cities, and our desire to make something that was primarily  . Somehow, that all resulted in a story about a lone archivist cataloguing creepy tapes. ” The creators of the show are big fans of unsettling horror films like It Follows and    as well as the work of authors Kelly Link, Samuel R Delany, Ursula K Le Guin, and Jeff VanderMeer. Fans of those writers will undoubtedly enjoy getting lost in Archive 81.

Sisters separated 40 years ago in Korea reunited working in same US hospital
Two orphaned sisters separated decades ago in South Korea have been reunited after being hired at the same hospital in Florida. The women, now both in their 40s, were stunned to learn that they were related, having not seen each other since the early 1970s. Both women had suffered tragic losses and spent time at orphanages in South Korea before being adopted by American families. As a very young child,    —   now known as Meagan Hughes  —   had been taken from her alcoholic father by her mother. But the woman left Hughes’ half sister,   Shin, known as Holly Hoyle O’Brien, who was two years older, in the care of the father. When the father died, O’Brien, then aged five, ended up in an orphanage in Pusan, 200 miles (335km) south of the capital, Seoul. In 1978, aged nine, she was adopted by an American couple who gave her the new name and took her to be part of their family in the state of Virginia. Her half sister, Hughes, also has memories of a Korean orphanage but recalls little of her biological mother or what happened to her. In 1976 she was also adopted by an American family, growing up in New York state, about 300 miles (480km) from her sister. Earlier this year, O’Brien was hired at a hospital in Sarasota, Florida, working as a nursing assistant on the fourth floor. Three months later, Hughes was hired to work on the same floor. The two women worked the same  . 30pm shift and struck up a friendship quickly. The coincidences began stacking up. Both had “abandonment” listed on their orphanage paperwork and both had been adopted by American families.  O’Brien told the Sarasota  : “I was like, this is too good to be true. I said we’ve got to do the DNA test, it’s the only way we’ll get the truth out of the whole thing. ”  She ordered DNA kits from Canada and the women did mouth swabs, which were sent back to Canada in early August.  The match was positive. “I’m like, this can’t be,” O’Brien told the paper. “I was trembling, I was so excited. I was ecstatic. ”  Her half sister was just as surprised: “When I heard from Holly, my first reaction was like, ‘Oh my god.’ I was in shock, I was numb. I have a sister,” Hughes said.

Brazil grapples with lynch mob epidemic: ’A good criminal is a dead criminal’
At the height of the Brazilian summer, New Year’s Eve celebrations in the northeastern city of Fortaleza attract hundreds of thousands of revellers to the beach. Further inland, in the impoverished neighborhood of Dias Macedo, residents gather in the streets to drink, set off fireworks and wait for the sun to rise. This year, however, the celebration ended in confusion and tragedy. At around 3am, an    girl told her family that a neighbor, Clayton Sousa, 21, had taken her to a secluded area and sexually assaulted her. The accusation spread, and the crowd of revellers quickly became a mob. What came next was filmed on a mobile phone, and the footage was shared on social media. It shows Sousa lying in the middle of the street, covered in blood and howling in pain. A few people beat him with sticks and kick him in the head, as dozens of others watch. Then two men on a motorcycle run over his body. The man driving the bike was a   neighbour, said Sousa’s father, Porfirio. Two other attackers were his son’s best friends. “I don’t know why he ran over my boy like that,” said Porfirio. “But if he did what they say he did, shouldn’t they have taken him to the cops?” Sousa died on the afternoon of 1 January, the first reported casualty this year of a lynching epidemic that has swept Brazil at a time of acute political and economic upheaval. The surge in vigilante justice has hit Fortaleza particularly hard. Most victims of mob attacks have been accused of petty crimes, such as stealing bicycles, cellphones and, in one case, a pair of sandals. The 10th annual report by the Brazilian Forum on Public Security, published on 3 November, revealed that Fortaleza had the highest number of homicides of any state capital in 2015. The report also revealed that 57% of Brazilians agree with the popular saying “a good criminal is a dead criminal”. A Guardian analysis of local news coverage and official records of violent deaths reveals that so far this year, at least 173 people have been killed by mobs in Brazil  —   an average of one every two days. Fortaleza reportedly had 14 fatal lynchings, more than any other city in the country. “People feel so vulnerable,” said Cesar Barreira, head of the Violence Studies Lab at the Federal University of Ceará. He pointed to Fortaleza’s rampant inequality and precarious housing conditions as factors contributing to residents’ hypervigilance. “A lynching is a communal act in response to a sense of impotence,” Barreira said. “It’s a hunt for an infection inside a social group. ” The Guardian’s investigation shows that suspected thieves account for more than half of the reported deaths in 2016 for which the lynch mob’s motive is known. In comparison, murder suspects make up 20% of fatalities, and suspected child molesters 7%. Of the 14 people reportedly killed by angry mobs in Fortaleza this year, 10 were accused of petty theft. One victim in March had allegedly snatched a woman’s handbag and cellphone before he was overpowered and stoned to death.  Less than 48 hours later, a young man was killed after allegedly trying to rob a bus. A clip posted on YouTube captures the attack, from the moment the crowd tackles him, to his repeated attempts at escaping, to the beatings and the stabbings, up until the moment his body is left splayed across the cobblestone sidewalk. The entire incident lasts 33 seconds. “Robberies frequently lead to lynchings because [the suspects] get caught in the act,” Fabio Paiva, a researcher at the Violence Studies Lab, said in a telephone interview. “The most inexperienced criminals are the ones that end up getting killed. They are often offenders with the lowest recidivism potential. ” On the walls of Dias Macedo, the poor neighborhood where Sousa died on New Year’s Day, graffiti warns   infractors: “You steal, you die. ”  One of the men who attacked Sousa was himself shot dead in September, after he allegedly stole a laptop, said Detective João Borges Neto.  The neighborhood, one of the poorest in Fortaleza, is a   car ride away from Arena Castelão, the soccer stadium refurbished ahead of the 2014 World Cup for 623m reais (£149m). Analysts say that the economic insecurity and social upheaval brought on by Brazil’s   crisis, meanwhile, may have helped drive the rise in vigilante attacks. Sociologist José de Souza Martins first recorded an increase in lynching attempts halfway through 2013  —   the precise moment when the country exploded into protest against corruption, police brutality, poor public services and excess spending on the World Cup.  Since then, mass demonstrations have become routine, and in the last year alone, Brazil has grappled with an epidemic of the Zika virus, the impeachment of its first female president, the biggest corruption scandal in its history and the worst economic recession in 80 years. And amid this societal crisis, vigilante attacks have become deadlier, Martins said. In a single day, 20 June, Fortaleza registered three fatal lynchings. One of the victims, a    woman, was killed after being accused of shoplifting a pair of sandals. Experts say that the phenomenon is underreported: the government does not track episodes of vigilante justice.  “The crime is not written into the penal code. Official data does not exist. The word ‘lynching’ does not always show up in newspaper reports,” said Ariadne Lima Natal, a sociologist at the University of São Paulo who studied mob violence in the state over a   period. The public safety department of the state of Ceará declined to comment for this article. In a rare move, state prosecutors brought charges against 12 people for Sousa’s homicide in February. The original accusation, meanwhile, remains unsolved.  Detectives told the Guardian that Sousa’s alleged victim had injuries consistent with sexual assault. But they are unsure whether Sousa was the culprit. Speaking to a local reporter days after Sousa died, his mother pleaded for answers. “I have a right to know if my son did this, if my son is a monster,” she said. “He can’t defend himself because he’s already dead. ”

Other People review: cancer comedy lets Molly Shannon wring all types of tears
Other People announces itself in its   sequence. A family wails over their recently deceased mother, only to be interrupted by an interminable phone message from a family friend who calls to check in on her health, then gets distracted by a pressing order to a   joint. Chris Kelly, a   Emmy nominee who currently serves as writing supervisor on Saturday Night Live, swings for the fences in his   debut, juggling tragedy with   laughs. Remarkably, he succeeds, and the results recall   another tonal tightrope walk about cancer. Yet, in the end, Other People is the more devastating in its unflinching examination of the fallout of one woman’s death on her   clan. Following that bold, hilarious opening sequence, Kelly backtracks a year to trace the gruelling months that led to such an uncomfortable scenario.  Breaking Bad’s Jesse Plemons is cast against type as David, a gay comedy writer who relocates from New York City to Sacramento to help his ailing mother, Joanne (Molly Shannon) and lend emotional support to his conservative father (Bradley Whitford) and two sisters (Maude Apatow and Madisen Beaty). David arrives in Sacramento defeated: on top of the news of his mother’s diagnosis, the TV pilot he had high hopes for didn’t get picked up, and he recently split from his boyfriend of five years (Zach Woods). In an effort to keep his mother’s spirits afloat, he pretends to still be in a relationship.  Joanne’s sunny demeanour begins to dissipate as her cancer spreads. To make the most of her last months with her family, she quits chemotherapy  —   a difficult decision we see in a powerhouse sequence which has Joanne grappling with her mortality alongside her husband in a hospital room. In the corridor outside, her children tearfully listen.  The laughs in Other People come in spurts, often cued by the jarring rhythms of Patrick Colman’s editing, as well as Joanne’s mordant resignation. When asked by her husband over milkshakes if she’d like to be cremated, Joanne drolly says she’d like to be frozen instead: “I don’t like camping   …     and I don’t like fire. ” Also contributing chuckles are David’s grandfather (Paul Dooley) prone to oversharing no matter how uncomfortable the memory, and Justin (JJ Totah) the adopted little brother of David’s close friend. The child actor, best known for a short run on Glee, comes close to stealing the movie as a fiercely effeminate,   kid, whose sass lifts David’s spirits.  Yet it’s Shannon who leaves the most lasting impression. Another Saturday Night Live veteran, she effortlessly mines the material for all its uncomfortable laughs (Plemons on the other hand plays David a bit too introverted to be fully persuasive as a joke factory). Shannon shows new shades in her deft handling of a tragedy she’s tasked with bearing. Further proof that when it comes to drama, comedy actors are often the experts.

Sam Mendes won’t direct next James Bond film: ‘It’s time for somebody else’
Sam Mendes, the acclaimed director of Skyfall and Spectre, said on Saturday he will not direct the next James Bond film. “It was an incredible adventure, I loved every second of it,” Mendes said at the Hay festival, of his five years working on Bond. “But I think it’s time for somebody else. ” A former theatre director whose films include the   American Beauty and the sombre Revolutionary Road, Mendes said he hoped the next Bond director would come from an “unexpected direction” just as he had.  Skyfall was a huge hit with critics and fans, with many saying he brought new depth to the characters. Spectre was also a substantial success, although some critics said it seemed a bit tired. Mendes indicated a desire to work on something fresh. “I’m a storyteller,” he said. “And, at the end of the day, I want to make stories with new characters. ” It is not yet clear if Daniel Craig will return for a fifth turn as 007. Tom Hiddleston and Idris Elba are among his rumoured replacements, although this week Gillian Anderson pitched to play a female Bond.  Hiddleston and Elba are popular with moviegoers and have been backed by the bookmakers. However, Mendes said lobbying by fans is pointless because the decision will be made solely by the series producer, Barbara Broccoli. “It’s not a democracy,” he said. “Barbara Broccoli decides who is going to be the next Bond, end of story. ” Mendes said that worked out well when Broccoli chose Craig, a   actor, for the key role at a time when he had “zero” support from fans. Many fans now consider Craig’s portrayal of the suave spy as having revitalised the Bond series. Sir Sean Connery played the role first, completing six official films and playing the role once outside the series, in the Thunderball remake Never Say Never Again. Sir Roger Moore has played Bond the most times, in seven films between 1973 and 1985. Pierce Brosnan starred in four Bond films, while Timothy Dalton played the spy twice and George Lazenby once.

Warcraft: The Beginning review – end already nigh for gaming franchise
The World of Warcraft online game apparently had 12 million players at its peak, and every single one of them is going to need to turn up to see this  —   with their extended families  —   if it’s ever going to get past its first instalment. It’s an expensive,   epic reminiscent of The Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones. And there’s much to admire in its ambition, its design, even its politics. But there’s also a whiff of the John Carter about it. Like the 2012 Martian flop, it’s a complex,   deadly earnest battle epic, short on star power and with more than a touch of 1970s fantasy art about it. Its greatest battle could be against widespread indifference. Newcomers have a lot to get up to speed with here. Our home world is Azeroth, a    realm along the lines of medieval Europe. The population is mostly human, mostly white, but there are also dwarves, elves and various other mythical creatures in the fringes. Azeroth’s stability is rocked by a sudden influx of orcs, who pour in from another world through a magic portal. These orcs aren’t the anonymous monsters of Tolkien lore they’re more like intelligent ogres, with tiny heads,   lower canines, and giant hands with fingers the size of human arms. When it comes to orc style, the art directors have really gone to town  —   or at least to the abattoir. Accessories include dreadlocks, piercings, hides, pelts and not just bones but entire animal skeletons. One badass has rhino skulls as shoulder pads, another has piercings through his tusks. “We must summon the Guardian!” say the good folk of Azeroth at the sight of these invading orcs, referring not to a leading liberal newspaper but a wizard in a tower, humourlessly played by Ben Foster. We first find this   mage working on his sculpture, wearing leather trousers and no shirt  —   never a good sign. Together with the young king and queen (Dominic Cooper and Ruth Negga) her brother (Travis Fimmel  —   think Aragorn without the charisma) and a young apprentice wizard (Ben Schnetzer) they must mount a resistance. The prospect of a predominantly white, European realm being invaded by foreign, primitive, darker skinned hordes (they are actually called the Horde) might set alarm bells ringing in our current climate of immigration anxiety. Is this a veiled Ukip broadcast? Or a   one? Nobody suggests the orcs are there to steal Azeroth’s jobs or exploit its benefits system, thankfully, though they are intent on overrunning their adoptive country and sucking the souls out of all its living creatures.  To its credit, Warcraft does blur the us v them battle lines. The first character we meet is Durotan, a principled orc chieftan and new father, played in expressive performance capture by Toby Kebbell (he’s lighter skinned than other, more evil orcs but let’s not dwell on that). Durotan has his doubts about the   orc leader and attempts to broker a deal with the humans. There’s also Garona, a       with divided loyalties. Played by Paula Patton, she’s one of the story’s most intriguing characters, a   warrior concealing a traumatic past. We want to find out more about her, but between plot demands and the speech impediment caused by her prosthetic dentistry, we don’t really get to. That’s part of the problem with Warcraft: there’s a lot going on and yet we’re never quite engaged with it. In The Lord of the Rings, we had the Shire, the Hobbits’ idyllic pastoral realm, as an image of what everyone was fighting for  —   one that   Europeans could easily relate to. Here, we barely see Azeroth outside the royal castles and wizards’ towers and epic battlegrounds. The heavy use of CGI, and its occasionally awkward interactions with the   elements, only serves to distance us even more. Much processing power has been put in the service of spectacular, bludgeoning combat, but the images are somehow insubstantial, and we rarely feel the heat of the battle. Perhaps both problems are down to the film’s computer game origins. Director Duncan Jones, a   Warcraft fan, has clearly put a lot of love and care into fleshing out a story, but it’s questionable whether it was ever really merited. There’s a terminal flimsiness, as if this   world hasn’t quite assumed three dimensions.

’The Latino vote’ didn’t overwhelm Trump, because we’re not all the same
There was a moment where it seemed like the prophecy would come true. Reports came out of Latinos in Nevada turning out in droves to vote against Donald Trump. #SomosElMuro, We Are the Wall, sprang up as a hashtag. Alongside it, people shared their inspiring pictures of the demographic that would stop Trump. And then, it evaporated. Yes, Latinos showed up for early voting, and the majority did throw their support behind Hillary Clinton, but no sleeping giant awoke. Well, one did, but it was   whites in the Rust Belt, and they voted overwhelmingly for Trump. Moreover, Latinos did not behave as an angry, unified front against a xenophobic candidate who called Mexican immigrants “rapists”. A   chunk of them cast their votes for him  —   29% in fact, according to CNN exit polls. That does not detract from the passionate opposition many Latinos feel for Trump, but it does give us reason to pause and consider why the popular narratives about this voting “bloc” never pan out, particularly narratives the Democratic party describes. The Latino vote is a conservative bogeyman. Conspiracy theories abound about Democrats letting Latinos into the country to boost their numbers. It’s a ridiculously   view that doesn’t reflect reality.  But the rote script Democrats read from when talking about Latinos isn’t proving to be realistic either. Tim Kaine being able to speak Spanish didn’t seem to get Latinos amped up, as the Democrats thought it would, and the idea that Latino voters are automatic gets or, more cynically, cheap dates for the DNC doesn’t seem to hold water either in light of the exit polls. What’s missing on both fronts is a more critical look at the Latino voter, the Latino   and how internal politics in our communities create a more complex group of people than either party assumed. To begin with, there is a definite current of conservatism present among some immigrant families. A strong “I got mine, so forget you” ideology that helps explain a more robust turnout for Trump among Latinos than pundits expected. Reports also show a growing number of evangelical protestant Latinos who are abandoning Catholicism. It’s also worth noting how, within marginalized groups including Latinos and black people, men were much more likely to vote for Trump than women, even if support for Clinton in those communities ultimately outweighed it. Some 13% of black male voters went for Trump, compared to just 4% of black female voters. We can’t pretend Trump didn’t appeal to some men of color, and that hints at misogyny in our communities. Of course, we can’t divorce any of this from voter restriction laws that target communities of color, or the way Latinos have been historically disenfranchised in our elections, or the fact that the supreme court dismantled voter protection in Shelby v Holder. But ultimately this election blindsided us on many fronts. White women didn’t rebuke Trump for his lewd remarks the majority voted for him. Latinos didn’t reject him wholesale, and across the board men from all groups were more likely to support him.  All this is to say, there probably isn’t a Latino sleeping giant waiting to propel Democrats to power. If the rise of a xenophobic demagogue who called us out by name wasn’t enough to jolt it awake, it’s hard to imagine that anything, outside of a presidential candidate from our community, would do so.  What we have on our hands instead is a complicated demographic comprising men, women, immigrants,   citizens, the   farmers, conservatives and progressives that is consistently thrown under the single umbrella of “Latino vote” in a way that simply doesn’t happen for white people.  That was the old playbook, and it ought to be considered obsolete after this election. The rules have changed, the polls proved useless, and a left that is not ready to adapt to these changes and will ultimately prove too weak to combat Trumpism and whatever comes after it.

Prince’s Purple Rain shirt fetches almost $100,000 at California auction
A white ruffled shirt that was worn by Prince in the film Purple Rain has sold at auction for 32 times its asking price, fetching nearly $100, 000. The New   ivory silk shirt and a    blazer from the 1984 film sold for $96, 000 (£72, 300) each at the sale in California. Profiles in History founder Joe Maddalena said the blazer  —   which had an asking price of $ $8, 000 (£ £6, 000)  —   was scheduled to be sold before Prince’s sudden death in April.  The signature shirt worn by Prince’s character the Kid had an asking price of $ $5, 000 (£ £3, 800) before the auction.  Prince, 57, was found dead at his Paisley Park compound in Minnesota on 21 April, from what was later found to be an accidental overdose of a powerful painkiller, Fentanyl.  Also in this week’s auction, a pair of     boots from the 1988 Lovesexy tour sold for $17, 920 (£13, 500) while a necklace from his Diamonds and Pearls music video fetched $8, 320 (£6, 300). A white ruffled shirt from the Purple Rain tour sold for $32, 000 (£24, 100).  Speaking before the sale, Maddalena said a makeup artist was given the blazer after she worked on Purple Rain. “It just happened to be one of those coincidences that unfortunately he passed away,” he said. “Probably the signature thing he is known for is Purple Rain. It’s what made his career. It’s probably what he’ll be remembered for always. To have an important piece like this is pretty astonishing and an amazing opportunity. ”  A spokesman for Profiles in History refused to reveal who bought the items from the Icons of Hollywood sale. A Swarovski   glove worn by Michael Jackson on his 1992 Dangerous world tour was also due to auctioned but was removed.  Last week, a yellow Cloud electric guitar that Prince played in concerts was sold at auction to the owner of the Indianapolis Colts, Jim Irsay. Prince used the guitar at gigs until the  .  Mr Irsay, who collects musical instruments, paid $137, 500 (£103, 000) for the guitar when it went on sale at Heritage Auctions in Beverley Hills, California.

Denzel Washington on diversity western The Magnificent Seven: ‘Audiences like to know who they’re rooting for’
It is   and the Venice Lido is a ghost town baking in the sun. The film festival wound down the previous evening, and now the thoroughfare between the beach and the cinemas is deserted except for construction workers in threes and fours dismantling the decorations. The glitz has faded. The stars are gone. Well, most of them. Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt are the last men standing in this tumbleweed town. In the street, their faces loom menacingly out of the posters for the remake of The Magnificent Seven, in which an ethnically diverse cast of outlaws and miscreants defend oppressed townsfolk from a brutal tyrant. Seated at a table in a hotel room, the actors appear somewhat less than magnificent. Washington is slumped in his seat. He is 61,    . He may be dressed in a baggy, grey   and jogging bottoms but his magnetism is undimmed. When he peers straight at you, there’s a crackle of electricity in the air. Those aren’t ordinary eyes: they’re the eyes of all the indomitable men he’s played, from Steve Biko to Malcolm X, the boxer Ruben Carter in The Hurricane to the drug lord Frank Lucas in American Gangster. He sweats gravitas. His       —   who is wearing jeans and a thin suede jacket, and sporting a sketchy beard  —   carries his fame more lightly. Pratt made his name as a deliriously dopey member of the Parks and Recreation ensemble. Superstardom only descended, though, once his   charms were transposed to a blockbuster setting in Guardians of the Galaxy and Jurassic World. A second Guardians movie is due next May. For now, it’s all about The Magnificent Seven. Except neither Washington nor Pratt seems especially keen to go on the record about any resonance the film might have in the wider world. With a cast list that offers a rebuke to conventional Hollywood casting (there’s even a woman among the seven heroes) and a conflict that pits poor against rich, the movie is in the tradition of westerns that comment on our times, such as Soldier Blue or The Wild Bunch. The film’s director, Antoine Fuqua, who coaxed Washington toward an   performance as a corrupt cop in Training Day, has said westerns “reflect where we are in the world”. So where exactly are we? Pratt wrinkles his nose. “Everything reflects,” he says. “Mirrors reflect. ” He lets that comment hang in the air. “I’m just not sure exactly what that reflection looks like. ” Washington has a stab. “Audiences like to know who they’re rooting for,” he says. “I remember going to the movies and having that feeling  —   ‘I wanna be that guy.’ Unfortunately, that was the 1970s so it was usually drug dealers: ‘I’m gonna be a dope dealer like him! ’” Still keen to hear how their Magnificent Seven relates to society today, I press the point. Why make the film now? “You’re putting too much on it, man!” Washington hoots. “It’s a movie. Antoine was excited about westerns. He grew up watching them with his grandma. He wanted to see me and Chris riding on horses. Next thing I know   …    ” He mimes trotting along on horseback, invisible reins in his hands. “It wasn’t, like: ‘How are we going to reflect society? ’” Point taken. As Washington pointed out in 1990, “Guys won’t spend $15 on Friday night to take their girls to see [Cry Freedom, in which he played Steve Biko]. Making movies like that shows that we’re committed to doing something about the issues, but people can see issues on the news for free. ” But doesn’t The Magnificent Seven fall into the category of entertainment that carries a thoughtful, progressive message? “That’s for the audience to decide. We’ll see. No hidden baggage over here!” He raises his arms, as though inviting me to frisk him. “I’m sorry if I’m not deep enough for you. I’m trying! I’m trying to get there. ” The room suddenly seems a tad warm. Pratt leans in. “There’s definitely a conversation that’s happening around the world and the movie seems to have become part of that. But that wasn’t our intention. I’m not the most articulate guy. I wish I were. So I’m not gonna be the one to express it. At the end of the day, it’s two hours of kickass entertainment. ” I try another tack. The villain, played by Peter Sarsgaard, is a greedy industrialist whose only love is for land and power. Any current presidential candidates spring to mind? Washington is having none of it. “Nah. That’s what you may see. The audience may not. ” I’m part of the audience, though. “Are you? You gonna pay to see the movie?” I’ve already seen it. “Are you gonna pay? Answer the question. ” I tell him I would do had I not seen it. I start to explain that I paid to see Safe House and Unstoppable and many of his other films. But it’s too late. He’s already laughing and braying (“ ! See? Right? ”) and wagging his finger triumphantly. “The average person who’s paying to see it is just looking for a good time. When I did Cry Freedom, a doctor friend told me: ‘Denzel, I have life and death in my hands every single day. I go to the movies to escape.’ What I got from that was that just because it’s important to me doesn’t mean it’s important to the everyday person. We just try to give them enough to get the monkey off their back so they can feel like: ‘Hey, I’m Chris Pratt up there,’ or ‘I’m Denzel.’ It ain’t that deep. ” I point out that films can easily contain both action and ideas. They’re not mutually exclusive. He has starred in plenty of examples  —   Malcolm X, Crimson Tide, Inside Man, Flight. “Sure,” he concedes. The pressing issue now is why neither actor will offer even the most superficial interpretation of the new picture. Is there a danger that if they describe it as one thing  —   the “diversity western” say, or the “  allegory”  —   then it will become fixed as that forever? “No, there’s a danger if you do,” Washington tells me. “How many readers you got?” I tell him what I can remember about circulation figures and online traffic. “What an opportunity you have. ” He sits back in his seat in the manner of a statesman who has settled a complex debate decisively, rather than an actor who has avoided a question. He stares at me for a moment, then his face breaks into a smile. “I’m just messing witchoo,” he says. Once again, Pratt steps in with a placatory aside. “It’s tough these days. I’m expecting people to talk about this movie and form their own opinions. I want theirs to be as valuable as mine. I’m not a politician. I’m not in the business of trying to shape people’s opinions. I’m an entertainer. I know there’s a giant industry now of talking about stuff and saying stuff. ” Washington lunges forward, palms downwards on the table. “Today’s subject: phones,” he says in the   voice of a news anchor. “Are phones safe for you? We have three experts on the left. And three experts on the right. We’ll be right back after this. ” Pratt launches into an advertising jingle  —   “Maybe it’s Maybelline!”  —   and the two men rock back and forth, laughing raucously. I laugh too, although I’m confused. Pratt’s objection, as far as I can make out, is that people are prone to discussion. He sets me straight: “I find myself kind of withdrawing a bit. Look, no one pays me for my opinion. If I say something stupid and it becomes a headline, it’s, like: ‘Guess what Chris said!’ Then everyone clicks on this stupid thing I said. ” He looks into his lap. “This is going really well,” he says quietly. I ask if they’ve both simply resolved to keep personal and political opinions private. “Would you?” Washington shoots back. I tell him that if he asked me a question, I’d answer it straight. “Who would you vote for if you could vote in the US election?” Easy. Hillary Clinton. And him? “That’s private. ” Pratt perks up: “I’m writing ‘Denzel’ on the ballot,” he says. More laughter. In 1992, when Bill Clinton was elected, Washington said he felt “a little hope”. I ask how he feels now and for a moment he looks like a man sick to death of having things he said more than 20 years ago read back to him. “I hope so,” he admits finally. Then it’s back to entertainment. “Whatever I’m thinking doesn’t have anything to do with the people who go see the movie to have fun. I never saw any movie because I read an article about it. ” Ah. Now the unspoken question hanging in the air is: why are we doing this interview? Instead, I steer it back to him. As a young actor, Washington was a big fan of James Earl Jones. Wouldn’t he have been interested in Jones’s opinions? He swivels round in his chair to address Pratt: “I saw James Earl Jones do Oedipus the King. He was magnificent. I went backstage and he let me try on his rings in the dressing room. They were huge! And he had this big, booming voice. ” He turns back to me. “That’s what it was. Not: ‘Mr Jones, what are your political opinions?’ Who cares?” So wouldn’t he have been curious to read about what Jones thought? “That assumes I was reading. ” Pratt jumps in. “They didn’t market that kind of thing,” he says. On the contrary, I tell him, whenever I research actors from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, they are invariably more forthcoming in their interviews. They offer opinions. They risk controversy. They don’t always play it safe. He asks me why that is and I suggest to him that information spreads so quickly now, and in so many different directions, that   and rigid PR management are the only ways to exert control. “You’re in the fortunate position of being able to research and take your time,” Washington tells me. “But, with clickbait, it doesn’t even need to be true. It just has to be first. ‘Oh, it was all lies? Who cares? ’” Indeed, the last time the Guardian interviewed Washington, the paper was upbraided by his publicists, who claimed that a quote about him not having made friends with his white counterparts in Hollywood had been taken out of context. The furore spread in an instant. Websites inveighed against this newspaper for printing falsehoods. Only after a few days did it transpire that Washington’s representatives had made no such objection. The complaint itself was a hoax. Such misunderstandings perhaps help to explain all the pussyfooting. Even so, Washington and Pratt have managed not to deliver a single tangible opinion  —   unless you count their views on the risks of giving opinions. It’s a tonic, then, to speak to Fuqua, who tells me that, yes, his version of The Magnificent Seven is unequivocally a portrait of the modern world. “Everything’s a little chaotic. We’re a bit divided. We’re fighting enemies we can’t see and who don’t play by our rules. There is tyranny. But the best part is we have a choice. In the film, we have black, white, Asian, Mexican, Native American, a white woman, all coming together to fight injustice. ” Fuqua has no issue with the movie being seen as an emblem of diversity. “There’s a problem. We did something about it. And here’s the beauty part: MGM and Sony backed it. No one said: ‘A black man? A Native American? ’” He is even happy for the villain to be regarded as a Trump surrogate. “I wouldn’t say not to. He represents that type. When I said tyranny, I meant raping the land, stealing people’s money. I made the movie because I wanted to say that. ” I breathe an internal sigh of relief at his directness. That wasn’t so hard, was it? Nothing like getting blood out of stones or opinions out of   actors. • The Magnificent Seven opens in the UK on 23 September.

Giuliani falsely claims Trump disavowed birtherism ’years ago’ – as it happened
In response to Rudy Giuliani’s claims about Donald Trump, circa 2012: Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump made his first serious foray into American presidential politics in 2011, when he made himself the most public face of the   “birther” movement, conspiracists who believe the   theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States and is therefore constitutionally ineligible to serve as president. Since deciding to become Obama’s successor, he has avoided answering questions as to whether he still believes that Obama was not born an American citizen, but that hasn’t kept members of the press from asking both the candidate and his surrogates whether Trump still subscribes to a conspiracy theory that many Americans see as racist. The latest surrogate: Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who told MSNBC’s Chris Matthews tonight that Trump had long ago dismissed the theory publicly. This has never happened. “I confirm that and Donald Trump now confirms that,” Giuliani said when Matthews asked him to confirm that Obama was born in the US. “He did that two years ago. .. two years ago. Three years ago. ” Giuliani continued, blaming the fomenting of birtherism on Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign, due to some volunteers, later fired, who spread emails stirring the conspiracy. “The point is that Hillary Clinton’s campaign is the first one to do it because all she does is engage in negative campaigning against Barack Obama and against Donald Trump. ” “He is the one who got him to finally produce the birth certificate,” Giuliani said of Trump. “Hillary Clinton’s campaign first raised this issue. ” Matthews attempted to get Giuliani, as Trump’s surrogate, to commit Trump to declaring in public that Obama is a legitimate citizen of the United States within the next 24 hours, but Giuliani averred. “You are speaking for Donald Trump,” Matthews said, nearly shouting. “And we are ending this now because we are spending a lot of time on it but I think it is important. You say this president was legitimately elected president of the United States and you say your candidate agrees with you. ” “I believe he was legitimately elected president,” Giuliani said. “And instead of talking about the fact that Hillary Clinton violated probably about 40 different federal laws, we are talking about this, which is ridiculous. ” Speaking with Larry King on   RT America, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump declared that he doesn’t want Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson to participate in upcoming presidential debates and criticized the candidate for revealing to MSNBC this morning that he did not know what Aleppo is. “I don’t know that it’ll hurt him that much, frankly,” Trump said of Johnson’s comments this morning, in which he was asked how he would handle the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo, Syria. “But, you know, he didn’t know that. I saw that. And, you know, it maybe it’ll hurt him a little bit but I think he’ll scoot by. Look, he’s not too much of a factor. They seem to be going down. The other two, they seem to be going down a little bit   we’ll see what happens. ” Asked whether he would welcome Johnson to join himself and Hillary Clinton in the upcoming presidential debate at Hofstra University, Trump said no. “I’d rather be Hillary and myself because we’re the only two with a chance of winning. ” On “strength”:  Pool duty is hard work. As a young woman applying to law school, Hillary Clinton learned a hard, everlasting lesson in gender dynamics that would help shape her public persona years later as a politician. In a rare and deeply personal interview on the popular blog Humans of New York, the Democratic nominee said the public’s view of her as “cold” and “walled off” is the result of having learned to “control” her emotions. In the post, Clinton recalled sitting down to take a law school admissions test at Harvard. She realized looking around that room that she was one of just a handful of women taking the exam. As she waited for the exam to be administered, a group of men began to taunt the women, shouting insults like: “You don’t need to be here” and “There’s plenty else you can do. ” “One of them even said: ‘If you take my spot, I’ll get drafted, and I’ll go to Vietnam, and I’ll die,’” Clinton said. Clinton’s appearance on Humans of New York comes a day after the Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman, Reince Priebus, was roundly criticized for his musings on Clinton’s performance during the forum. Clinton’s campaign fired back: “Actually, that’s just what taking the office of President seriously looks like. ” One day after Donald Trump reiterated his admiration for Vladimir Putin, saying the Russian president was a better leader than Barack Obama, Republicans on Capitol Hill struggled to explain why their party’s presidential nominee was enamored with a man they have long cast as one of America’s primary foes. Many Republicans who returned to Washington this week after the summer recess expressed confidence that Trump was improving as a candidate in both tone and message. But on Thursday, they found themselves in the familiar routine of distancing themselves from Trump’s comments  —   the latest being his praise for Putin in an NBC News national security forum held Wednesday. “If you’re running for leader of the free world and you’re expressing admiration for Putin, well then you’re losing me,” Lindsey Graham, a senator from South Carolina and former Republican presidential candidate, told reporters. “I think Vladimir Putin is a thug, a dictator, an autocratic ruler who has his opposition killed in the streets of Russia. He has dismembered his neighbor. ” While Graham said he found Obama to be “weak” “indecisive” and someone Putin had “walked all over” the visibly frustrated senator added: “But no, I’m not going to say that Putin’s a better leader than a Democratic elected president of the United States even though I have differences with him. ” It was just earlier this week that Graham, who has thus far declined to endorse Trump and has been among the candidate’s biggest critics, spoke positively for the first time of the direction his campaign had taken. After telling reporters on Monday that Trump would give Hillary Clinton “a hell of a race” the senator hardly minced his words when reacting to Trump’s overtures toward Putin. “This whole idea of admiring Putin is the biggest misunderstanding of a relationship in a person since Munich,” Graham said. Marco Rubio, the senator from Florida who made his opposition to Putin a central tenet of his own presidential campaign, similarly disagreed with Trump’s assertion that the Russian president was a better leader than Obama. “Look, I have tremendous policy disagreements with President Obama, but Vladimir Putin is an authoritarian thug who is accountable to no one,” Rubio told the Guardian. “I don’t think what Vladimir Putin exhibits is leadership. I think what he exhibits is thuggery   …     and we should be   about that,” he added, noting that Putin controlled the media, the military and often his political opponents were either imprisoned or found dead. Asked by the Guardian if he was concerned that Trump had a penchant for commending Putin, despite those facts, Rubio said he was hopeful the candidate’s posture might evolve. “My sense is those views will probably change once he understands better who Vladimir Putin truly is  —   that’s my hope,” responded the senator, who is backing Trump. Who could it be? The Associated Press has deleted a    tweet in which it falsely characterized half of Hillary Clinton’s meetings during her tenure as secretary of state as having been held with donors to the Clinton Foundation: Donald Trump today attacked Hillary Clinton for espousing “ ” interventionist policies which he said has made the US less safe than ever before. The Republican presidential nominee also targeted the Democrat for what he said was her belief in “globalism” instead of “Americanism”. Trump repeated his claim to have been opposed to the Iraq war for which Clinton voted “from the beginning” a claim which has repeatedly been shown to be untrue. The Republican nominee was speaking in Cleveland, a day after taking part with Clinton in a “   forum” hosted by NBC and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, in New York City. That event offered a preview of the forthcoming presidential debates and led to criticism of the host, Matt Lauer, over his questioning of the two candidates. “She believes in globalism, not Americanism,” Trump said. “On top of it all, Hillary Clinton is trigger happy. ” The Cleveland speech was ostensibly dedicated to education policy and school choice. But Trump devoted significant time to   campaign themes, including a lengthy prelude about what he called Clinton’s “criminal  ” over her use of a private email server while secretary of state, her views on foreign policy and her record in office, and what he said were her frequent factual misrepresentations. Earlier, at a press conference on an airport tarmac in White Plains, New York, Clinton criticised Trump’s comments at the NBC forum about Russian president Vladimir Putin, of whom the Republican has often spoken favorably and who, he said on Wednesday, has “been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader”. Clinton said: “Now that is not just unpatriotic and insulting to the people of our country as well as to our   . It is scary. ” Trump said: “She tried to make up for her horrible performance last night. So she went on the tarmac and told more lies. ” Trump chose again to highlight his own historic statements in opposition to the Iraq war and call out Clinton’s 2003 vote in support of it, when she was the junior senator from New York. “Iraq is one of the biggest differences in this race,” he said. “I was opposed to the war from the beginning. ” Trump read aloud statements he made to Esquire magazine in August 2004, more than a year after the start of the Iraq war, in which he was critical of US policies in the country. “The media is so terribly dishonest, so I had to do this,” he said. Indiana governor Mike Pence has defended running mate Donald Trump’s declaration that Russian president Vladimir Putin is a superior leader compared to US president Barack Obama, telling CNN’s Dana Bash that it is “inarguable” that the Russian strongman is better than Obama. “I think it’s inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country. And that’s going to change the day that Donald Trump becomes president,” Pence said. In NBC’s “  ” forum last night, in which Trump and rival Hillary Clinton were separately questioned about matters relating to the military and national security, Trump told host Matt Lauer than Putin, who he has previously praised, has “been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader. ” Trump has been publicly enamored with the Russian strongman since the primaries, and is given to inaccurately repeating the anecdote that Putin once called him “brilliant. ” “I think when he calls me ‘brilliant,’ I’ll take the compliment,” Trump said last night about Putin. “If he says great things about me, I’m going to say great things about him. ” The story refers to remarks Putin made in December 2015, in which the Russian president   who has been criticized internationally for the invasion and annexation of Crimea, the murder by poisoning of a Russian citizen and has been implicated in the death of an investigative journalist, although Trump has dismissed such claims as baseless   when Putin used the word “yarkii” (or яркий) to describe Trump. The word means “brilliant” or “bright,” but in the sense of spectacle or shininess   akin to “flashy” or “flamboyant. ” Indiana governor Mike Pence doesn’t speak Hebrew   not that that’s a prerequisite for the office of the vice president   but according to The Forward, it makes reaching out to   voters a little, well, tricky: The Republican vice presidential candidate was photographed holding a sign written in Hebrew that was supposed to read ‘Make America Great Again’   but translates roughly as ‘To Reverse America to Great Once More.’ The first word on the bottom of the sign is a verb in its infinitive form, making it confusing to Hebrew speakers from the get go. As the election nears, the Obama swan song continues with ever growing poignancy. Today, first lady Michelle Obama hosted her fifth and final class of national student poets at the White House. “Well, I have to say that this event   I’ve said this too many times, because we’re celebrating a lot of ‘last’ here this year   but this is the last time that we’re going to have the pleasure of welcoming a class of national student poets to the White House, at least under this administration,” Obama said. “So I’m feeling a little melancholy here, because this has truly been an honour and a privilege and a joy. ” The first lady condemned the “pretty devastating” cuts to art and music classes in schools across the country that preceded her husband’s administration. A recent Washington Post article suggested that arts communities feel let down by the president for not showing a greater interest. But Obama said: “Barack and I also happen to be pretty huge poetry fans ourselves. My husband considers himself kind of a poet, but we’ll see. We’ll see. Maybe when he’s done he’ll write one for me. You hear that, honey? So that’s kind of where the idea of the national student poet programme came from. ” Obama also recalled the first White House poetry jam in 2009 where   Miranda rapped about Alexander Hamilton, soon to be expanded into the hit musical Hamilton, “one of the most extraordinary pieces of art that I   and probably so many others   have ever seen”. But it was a poetry medley by students past and present, beneath a portrait of Abraham Lincoln in the state dining room, that moved Obama to the brink of tears on Thursday. “If we ever wonder. .. ” she began, sighing with emotion, “if what we do makes a difference, it does. ” Her voice still low and unsteady, Obama added: “Thank you everyone for all of this. Thank you, guys. I’m so proud of you. That was beautiful. You guys are awesome. Have a great year. ”

Tearful Lynsey Sharp says rule change makes racing Caster Semenya difficult
A tearful Lynsey Sharp said the decision to overturn rules on testosterone suppression made competing against the women’s Olympic 800m champion, Caster Semenya, and other hyperandrogenic athletes difficult. The British runner finished sixth in Saturday night’s final in Rio as Semenya powered to gold. The South African has made a return to form after the court of arbitration for sport overturned a rule created by the International Association of Athletics Federations which had forced athletes with naturally high levels of testosterone to take   drugs. Sharp told the BBC after the race: “I have tried to avoid the issue all year. You can see how emotional it all was. We know how each other feels. It is out of our control and how much we rely on people at the top sorting it out. The public can see how difficult it is with the change of rule but all we can do is give it our best. “I was coming down the home straight, we were not far away and you can see how close it is. That is encouraging. We will work hard and aim to come back even stronger. ” Sharp, who ran a personal best 1min 57. 69sec, hinted that her feelings are shared by her fellow athletes Melissa Bishop of Canada and Poland’s Joanna Jozwik, who also missed out on medals. The three hugged together after the finish in what Sharp said was a show of unity. “We see each other week in, week out, so we know how each other feel. ” On her own performance, Sharp added: “I’ll have to watch it back. I feel a bit disappointed. I had a lot left at the end but I don’t know if that means I ran it right or had too much left. I came through strong at the end, that was good, but we shall see. ”

Afghanistan funds abusive militias as US military ’ignores’ situation, officials say
The US military and the CIA are turning a blind eye as Afghanistan’s spy agency spends foreign donor money on militias which are committing human rights abuses that help destabilise the fragile country, according to local and western officials.  The Afghan national directorate of security (NDS) arms strongmen ostensibly to fight the Taliban and other militants. But some militia leaders use their new power to fight local turf wars, including against elected government officials, rather than insurgents. One such commander, Perim Qul, in the northern province of Takhar, has received about $85, 000 (£70, 000) to arm 500 men. However, he allegedly spends part of that money on a private prison where he beats and extorts local people. His men have even ambushed and killed a local politician. One evening in July, Perim Qul’s men detained a man named Najib as he was relaxing outside the hotel he owns. After several days’ beating, Najib said he would acquiesce to their demands for cash and asked for a phone to request the $3, 000 they demanded. Instead, he called police, who rescued him. Najib sent photos of his bruised back and legs to the provincial prosecutor, and got one of his tormentors arrested. “I have no enmity with Perim Qul. I am just a simple hotel owner,” Najib said. That kind of justice, though minor, is rare in Rustaq district. Qul, a    war veteran with no official title, has been running Rustaq like a fiefdom for over a decade. Local residents say he has opposed any attempt  —   including by the government  —   to assert authority there. To pay his men, he allegedly coerces civilians. So when the Afghan government last year approved Qul’s request to enrol in its   militia program, many local people were concerned. Hundreds protested outside the district government building. Contemporary western security reports obtained by the Guardian warned that reinforcing Qul’s militia could add to violence, crime and territorial rivalries. Qul got money for 500 men. In reality, police officials believe, he commands up to 1, 500.  Meanwhile, there are only 35 national police officers to maintain security in the entire district, said Gulistan Samadi, a former district police chief. “I don’t believe in these uprising groups. They are irresponsible. They don’t care about the government,” Samadi said. “They are kidnappers, robbers and killers. They are worse than the Taliban. ” Shortly after Qul received the spy agency money, his men ambushed a vehicle carrying a local rival, the provincial council member Aynuddin Rustaqi, killed one bodyguard and abducted him. Rustaqi was eventually released, but a few months later, he was less fortunate. In April, an argument between the politician and the strongman turned violent, according to witnesses and western security analysts. After two militia members were killed, Rustaqi found himself surrounded in the local government headquarters by 200 armed men. During a more than   standoff, no government forces intervened, and Rustaqi was eventually killed alongside three supporters and another person.  “The government can’t stop them because they don’t have the force,” said Najib, the hotel owner. Rustaqi was a vocal critic of the government’s arming of irregular militias. His son said he was a victim of nothing more than a brutal show of force. “For 13 years Perim Qul has tried to run for provincial council, but he doesn’t have public support. Now, he has a lot of armed men,” said Ahmad Jawad, the son. In an interview, Perim Qul admitted that his chief enemy was not the Taliban, whom he was paid to fight. It was the local governing political party. “We will fight alongside any group to get rid of the oppression of Jamiat,” he said, referring to the   party in the north, which he says discriminates against people of other ethnicities. “We don’t care if it’s Taliban or Isis. If anyone throws a stone at our enemy, we will fight with them. ” Qul said he was not out to unseat the government. “If the government provides security and asks us to put down our weapons, we will disarm,” he said. The People’s Uprising program is reminiscent of a controversial local police scheme, ALP, initially introduced by the US military to build   resistance to the Taliban and help foreign forces withdraw from Afghanistan. However, the ALP has been widely criticised for employing child soldiers, abusive behaviour, and creating fertile ground for armed opposition such as the Taliban. While the US does not directly support People’s Uprising groups, the militias are bankrolled by the National Directorate of Security  —   and the bulk of NDS funding is believed to come from the CIA. In the past, the CIA has run paramilitary Afghan units responsible for killing civilians. More recently, the Washington Post has reported that the CIA also funds and operates alongside ruthless militias in the Afghan east. A spokesman for the CIA refused to comment. The Afghan government said it worked “with a lot of precaution” when supporting People’s Uprising groups. It insisted that the program had been “effective in most of the cases” said Haroon Chakhansuri, a presidential spokesman. The NDS officially declined to comment, but a local NDS official in Takhar province said the allegations against Perim Qul in this article were founded. While the US military said it did not fund the Afghan intelligence agency, it did support the army and police, whose jobs become more difficult when violence flares up. Yet, international forces claim to not discuss the militia program with the Afghan government. “It’s just not a topic we’re engaging the government on,” said Charles H Cleveland, the international coalition’s spokesman. “It’s a sovereign nation they make sovereign decisions. ” Cleveland did not see militia leaders like Qul undermining security. “I have not seen any hard facts to support what you’re saying,” he said. “But I’ll grant you, you can go anywhere in Afghanistan and find almost anything. ” However, an informed coalition staff member said the US military was fully aware of Perim Qul’s activities but turned a blind eye, perhaps because the regular Afghan forces were stretched so thin they depended on vigilante militias. “They are not ignoring it out of ignorance. They are ignoring it with intent,” he said. The same reasoning might apply to the Afghan government, which is mired in political crisis and a   war. As one western official put it: “While the government is busy in Kabul, Perim Qul is carving out his own little empire. ”

Mark Leckey: the raving artist goes large at MoMA PS1 in New York
In 1988, the British artist Mark Leckey spent the summer in Brighton. He was 24 and looking for work, but he found play  —   specifically at the front doorstep of the Zap nightclub, which essentially kicked off his art career. “I literally walked into this rave where it was full of dry ice,” says Leckey on the phone from PS1, where he opened an exhibition on Sunday. “This guy just loomed out of the dry ice with this smiley face mask on. I thought, here we go. ” If there was ever an artist who uses leftfield pop music as the altar of inspiration, it’s got to be   Leckey, who won the Turner Prize in 2008. The title of his new show Containers and Their Drivers is probably the first museum exhibition ever to be named after a song by Mancunian postpunk legends the Fall. For his first US survey, Leckey may seem like an art world superstar  —   he showed with Damien Hirst in 1990 at ICA’s New Contemporaries show, is collected in the Tate and the Centre Pompidou and is even married to the head of programs at Serpentine Galleries, Lizzie  . But that’s not to categorize him. The song Containers and Their Drivers is about the shipping industry, which resonates with the setup of Leckey’s exhibition. “Everything in the show is a kind of container a fridge, sound systems, objects that contain something,” he said. But what container does Leckey fit into? This show is basically a retrospective, but he gets a different label. “The art world is cautious with the word ‘retrospective,’ it’s a ‘  survey,’” he said, with a chuckle. “They’re not wholly convinced yet that I’m around for keeps. You don’t get a retrospective until everyone is absolutely certain. There hasn’t been full consensus. ” While his introduction to the Zap marked Leckey’s foray into rave culture, it didn’t stop there. “Raves were in warehouse parties, illegal raves, things you can’t do now in London,” he said. The memories are now immortalized in a 1999 video collage called Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore, (named after the Italian clothing brand, popular with the    obsessed “casuals” subculture) a euphoric and strangely poignant work which stitches together footage of clubbers dancing from the days of Northern Soul in the 70s to the raves of the 90s.  Looking back on this fine showcase of British nightlife, there may be countless rave compilations on YouTube today, but he made it in a time before social media. “The internet was in its early stages,” said Leckey. “You couldn’t email people, I would write people and request VHS tapes and get them converted from analogue to digital. It was a long, involved process everything became precious and special. It became more about video than rave. ” Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore celebrates the era of   electronic music made on cheap equipment in bedrooms, raves in warehouses and fields, the joy of a young generation seizing upon new technologies to express themselves through dance. “The same happened to me with video,” said Leckey. “It was only when I was able to make and edit video at home on a computer that I started making art properly. ” And then, of course, there were the drugs, the first explosion of acid house in 1988 fuelled by the widespread availability of ecstasy which, legend has it, made the football casuals who would fight the supporters of rivals teams on the terraces start hugging and dancing with them in the clubs. “Rave is a diminishing attempt to find the experience of ecstasy again, not the drug but through other means,” says Leckey. “That’s the part of the reason to make work, that moment of psychedelic bliss. ” His love of sound is personified in his Sound System sculptures from 2001 to 2012, as Leckey has built five functioning sound systems which spew out sporadic, intermittent sounds and songs in the gallery space, from bassy soundscapes to gurgling stomach sounds, “and farting” adds Leckey. “Basically, I have a huge library of found sounds and I throw them on the speaker systems to see what works best, conceptually and acoustically,” he said. “I knew they had this quality of being both sculptural and sonically powerful. ” Probably the most   piece in the show is a new, expanded presentation of his 2015 short film Dream English Kid 1964 —  1999 AD, a sort of autobiography told through TV clips, props that play out personal memories and YouTube videos, like clips of a 1950s housewife trying LSD, videos by the Beatles and a documentary on David Hockney. “I did it to exorcise stuff that was lingering too long inside of me,” said Leckey. “As a    man, there are things I haven’t resolved and am trying to fathom, it’s a  . ” It’s full circle from the challenging time he had in art school, a place he went to meet   people but ended up getting ensnared in the academic concepts. After reading Roland Barthes and Hal Foster, he says, “I got militant about critical theory, I became a little   in terms of critical theory policing everyone else. ” After taking a break from art, Leckey started making work about his life. “I make things that mattered to me with my immediate experience, that’s why I made work relating to rave,” he said. Leckey is still a fan of happy hardcore, the technicolour, cheesily euphoric,   dance music which soundtracked hundreds of   club nights. “It’s brilliant,” he says, divulging the contents of his iTunes library: “The Frozen musical soundtrack meets happy hardcore from 1992 are the two biggest influences in my life. ” Leckey has dabbled with making his own music in the past and will soon return to his home studio. “When I go back to London, I will make more music again,” he says. “I think music works best when it’s stupid, that’s why I like rave I want to make stupid music where you’re not thinking, you’re reacting to what’s immediately in front of you and you’re trying to do it quickly. Fast music. ”

Grab Trump by the ballot: either our bodies are our own, or they’re not
The following is an edited version of a speech made by Guardian writer Jessica Valenti to Planned Parenthood of the Southern Finger Lakes last week. How is everyone doing? Ready for November 8 yet?  Tonight, I was asked to speak about a vision for the next hundred years of reproductive choice and justice. It’s such a wonderful frame  —   to think about what a feminist future might look like. But I bet like a lot of you, it’s hard to imagine what the next hundred years will look like when so much of that, for women especially, will depend on what happens in just 18 days. There is no overstating how important this election is. It’s not just about the next four or eight years. This decision is about sending a message about who we are as a country, and setting a very particular course for the women who live here. We’ll look back on this time as a watershed moment: a moment that could, in fact, shape the next hundred years of women’s rights. But first I want to share a personal story.  A little over six years ago, I was pregnant with my daughter, Layla. And when I was 28 weeks pregnant, I got incredibly ill. I developed   which some of you might know is dangerously high blood pressure during pregnancy. I was admitted to the hospital and within just a few days, I developed another complication called HELLP syndrome, the short version being my liver was in danger of failing, and I was in danger of dying if my daughter was not born. I had an emergency   and Layla was born weighing 2lb 2oz. She stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit for the first two months of her life, undergoing medical interventions to save and protect her that to this day I try to avoid thinking about.  But I was lucky, and she was lucky, and today she’s a wonderful healthy   . And I feel grateful for that every day. I share this story often, because this was something in my life that changed me forever, that shaped who I am today. And when I think about this moment, what I think about most often is how fortunate I was that I got sick far enough along in my pregnancy that I wasn’t faced with the reality of needing an abortion to save my life. And when I think about those days in the hospital  —   the fear, the urgency, the confusion, the stress  —   the idea that the government could ever become involved in my life’s most pivotal moment? It horrifies me. So one thing I want for the next hundred years? I want for no person, ever, to fear that their most personal life choices will be made by someone else. I want for no woman, ever, to be afraid that her scariest life moment will be made even more difficult and traumatic by government interference. In the next hundred years, I want to see every woman be free from the fear that her body is not really her own. And that’s why I want to talk about this election tonight. Because that’s what’s at stake. Never before in American politics have women’s bodies been so front and center in the national conversation. And so at risk. We are choosing between a candidate who has spent her political career fighting for reproductive rights, and a candidate who says that women who have abortions need to be punished. A candidate who said this week in the final debate unequivocally that she will defend Planned Parenthood, and a candidate who promised to defund it. A choice between a person who has spent her life in public service, and a braggadocious businessman who rips off his workers. And, perhaps most tellingly: we’re making a decision between a woman who has said that “women’s rights are human rights” and a man who says if you want to, you can just grab women “by the pussy”. There’s a feminist rallying cry online right now that I like a lot, and it says: November 8, pussy grabs back. Now, I know that so much has been made of that comment, and the ensuing allegations against Trump by multiple women that he did just what he bragged about doing on that tape. And while some people may not see the link between sexual assault and reproductive rights, those of us here in this room know better. We know that there is a direct connection between those who think they can touch women’s bodies without permission and those who think they can legislate our bodies.  Reproductive rights and justice has always been about a fundamental respect  —   or in this case, disrespect  —   of women’s bodily integrity and autonomy. Either our bodies are our own, or they’re not. And make no mistake, the conversation that we’re having right now about “groping” is not just salacious media fodder. The way we come out of this moment  —   the direction our culture shifts because of it  —   will absolutely determine women’s rights in the future.  We are witnessing a moment where our country could move backwards  —   back to a place where “boys will be boys” and men will make decisions for women. Or towards a future where our culture and politics understand and respect women as autonomous full human beings. Those are the two paths. Right now, I’m optimistic that we’re on the right one. The one that brings us to the feminist future all of us in this room have been waiting for.  When Trump said he wanted to punish women for having abortions, there was outrage and he had to walk back those comments. But more importantly,   activists and organizations like Planned Parenthood were there to point out that while other politicians may not say they want women to be punished, that’s exactly what would happen if abortion were made illegal. And in fact, what has already happened to women like Purvi Patel, who was put in prison for inducing her own abortion in Indiana. Our feminist future has no place for criminalizing women who decide if and when to parent. When Donald Trump claimed that what he said on that Access Hollywood tape was just “  talk” and later when former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said that all men talk like this, men across the country came out to say: no. This is not normal. This is not acceptable. Men are better than this.  The feminist future that we’re fighting for has men fighting alongside of us, men who refuse to be insulted by antiquated and sexist ideals about what it means to be a “real man”. When Trump claimed that the women who have accused him of sexual assault were not attractive enough to warrant his unwanted attention, when he called women disgusting, when he called women pigs, the media  —   who can so often get things wrong  —   took him to task. Because our feminist future is not one where misogyny will go unchecked. Women have been disparaged and harassed for too many years, and we’re not going to take one more minute of it. We’re done. Of course this feminist future  —   the future that we’re so close to getting  —   it’s not just being hinted at by the reaction and opposition to Donald Trump. We are getting a sense of what that future could look like when we see the incredible way feminists and women themselves have changed the conversation. This week, for the first time ever, a presidential candidate offered a nuanced and empathetic defense of   abortions on a national debate stage. This is a   issue that most politicians won’t touch, but Clinton talked about women’s lives and experiences in a way that reminded us that this issue isn’t just about policy  —   it’s about us. We’re living in a moment when feminism is wielding more cultural power than it has in decades, maybe ever. People don’t shy away from the word feminism any more, they embrace it. When I started speaking on college campuses 10 years ago, I would ask how many people in the room considered themselves feminists. Back then, just a few people would raise their hands. When I speak at colleges today, nearly everyone does. Feminism has become so popular that the conservative right has tried to appropriate it  —   Sarah Palin calls herself a feminist,   organizations call themselves the “real” feminists. They recognize the power that the word and the movement have, and they want to use it toward their own, very   ends. But our feminist future is a smart one, and it knows that anyone who would legislate women’s bodies, who would interfere in women’s and families’ private medical decisions have no place calling themselves feminists. Of course, being in this incredible feminist moment  —   when the first female president is about to win by taking down a man who is as close to a caricature of misogyny as you can get  —   being in this moment doesn’t mean that our feminist future is guaranteed. It’s not. Those of us who have been doing this work for years know that every time women make political and cultural strides, there is an intense backlash  —   we’re in the midst of it now, and it will only intensify if Hillary Clinton becomes president. Making sure that this backlash doesn’t define us  —   that we are not put on the defensive by it  —   that is what will truly determine our feminist future.  Will we get pushed back on our heels or will we look straight ahead and move forward? Will we rest on our laurels because we have the first woman president or will we take our moment to celebrate and then move on to the hard work that still needs to be done? If the people in this room, and the people at Planned Parenthood are any indication  —   we know the answer to those questions. This is just the beginning, My daughter tells me that she wants children one day. (Though she says she doesn’t want to be pregnant  —   her wife will have the kids.) But when she talks about having children, when I think about being a grandmother or a even   one day  —   that’s when I think about those hundred years that we’ve been talking about. I think about what the world will be like for them. And I have faith, I really do, that it will be a world  —   that this will be a country  —   where people determine their own destiny. A world where we understand that reproductive rights are not just an issue of women’s bodies  —   but an economic issue, a family issue, and a human rights issue.  And the reason I have faith that future generations will see this vision of feminism and justice unfold is because of activists like you all here. Because of Planned Parenthood. Every day they are ensuring that the next hundred years will be years where women’s words, lives, bodies and experiences matter. Years where we’re not defending ourselves from attack, but building something progressive and something real. All of you in this room are doing what is necessary to ensure that feminist future. I could not be more grateful to you, and I could not be more honored to join that fight with you.

I’m a Hispanic immigrant. But to the world I am a lily-white Wasp
I am not what most people think of when they imagine a Hispanic immigrant. I am paler than most   Americans, I live in a leafy suburb, and my English is better than my Spanish. There’s also the small detail that I do not remember my own immigration.   I came to the US shortly after my first birthday, on an American Airlines flight from El Dorado airport in Bogotá, Colombia, to Dulles international airport in the suburbs of Washington DC, in 1999. My parents were both professionals with graduate degrees. My father was moving from a job in a management consultancy in Bogotá to one near Washington. I had been born in Bogotá to a Colombian mother, from the Caribbean city of Barranquilla, and a Colombian American father whose early life acted as a mirror to mine. While I was born in Bogotá and raised in Washington DC, he was born in Washington DC and raised in Bogotá.   My grandparents were part of the politically active professional class of Colombia, and both my parents went to university in the US. Before I was born, they had lived in Paris for three years before moving back to Colombia for my father’s job. It was there that I was born.   Colombia at the time was not the Colombia of today. It was not a country to which you would see package vacations advertised in the New York Times. Violence due to drug cartels, fascist paramilitaries and communist guerrillas was still rife. My parents must have known that, but they had been away from the country for a while. My father thought that a normal life in Colombia, as they had lived in Paris, was possible. But when my mother heard that blue corneas had a market value, she decided that Colombia was not the place to raise her   son. It was at her insistence that my parents moved, with me, to Washington.   Of course, I don’t remember any of that. In all my memories I have lived in Bethesda, Maryland. I never experienced the struggle of learning a new language or fitting into a new culture. My mother became a US citizen in 2004 in order to vote for John Kerry, and apart from occasional trips to visit relatives in Colombia, we were as American a family as any of our white, mainly Wasp neighbors.   It was only in high school that I fully understood what it meant when I said that I was from Colombia. Before then, those who asked me tended to be my peers, who had no   notions of what a Colombian should be, or adults who knew my parents. But adolescence awakens adulthood, and it was in high school that I became conscious that I was an immigrant. People began to say: “You don’t look Colombian” or “You don’t look Hispanic. ” They did not mean any harm, and didn’t cause any either.   It was also in high school that I met immigrants who remembered their home countries. People from Colombia who spoke with accents utterly distinct to my bland   English, who could roll their Rs, and who knew the neighborhoods of the city where I had always said I was from.  Most of my friendship group did not include these newcomers. I had friends from middle school, and as high school progressed I stayed in the same, mainly white, milieu. I took SAT prep courses, fencing, advanced classes  —   in short, everything you would expect from a teen from upper   American suburbia who is aiming for the Ivies. Not that I have no Hispanic friends I do. They just tend to be as highly assimilated as I am.   I am an immigrant. But in all honesty, I do not know what it is like to leave the country you have known all your life, because the country I remember from my earliest days is the one I live in. But I was born abroad, and that geographical accident builds a silent and invisible wall between me and my purely   friends.

Billionaire businessman Vincent Viola picked as Trump’s army secretary
  Donald Trump announced on Monday that he has picked the New York billionaire businessman Vincent Viola to be his secretary of the army. Trump has appointed a number of billionaires to his cabinet, along with leading figures from the world of banking, prompting criticism from some quarters, given the success of a presidential campaign built around an appeal to   voters.  Prior to the appointment of Viola, 60, the net worth of Trump’s cabinet picks was reported to be around $14bn, making it the richest such group ever assembled.  The website Quartz reported that such a concentration of wealth was “more than that of the 43 million least wealthy American households combined  —   over one third of the 126 million households total in the US”. Viola, known as Vinnie, is the founder of several businesses including Virtu Financial, an electronic trading firm. He also owns the NHL’s Florida Panthers and is a past chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). In a statement, Trump said Viola was “living proof of the American dream” having grown up in a family of Italian immigrants in Brooklyn, where his father worked as a truck driver. The statement also cited Viola’s leadership of NYMEX after the terrorist attacks of September 11, when his “heroic leadership served as a beacon to thousands of Exchange members and staff”. Viola is a 1977 West Point graduate who trained as an airborne ranger infantry officer and served in the 101st Airborne Division.  He is also a graduate of New York Law School who in 2003 founded and helped fund the creation of the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point. In August, he told Bloomberg News in a rare interview he had “tried to     …     in my Wall Street experience” in his experience in the army, as a member of a division known as the Screaming Eagles. Viola bought the Panthers for about $250m in 2013. Reported to be worth $1. 8bn himself, he ranks No 374 on Forbes’ list of the 400 wealthiest people in the US.

If the US hacks Russia for revenge, that could lead to cyberwar
What’s the CIA’s brilliant plan for stopping Russian   on the US and their alleged interference with the US election? Apparently, some in the agency want to escalate tensions between the two superpowers even more and possibly do the same thing right back to them. NBC News reported late last week that the CIA is working up blueprints for an “unprecedented cyber covert action against Russia” and it sounds a lot like they’re planning on leaking documents on Vladimir Putin, just as the Russians are accused of doing to the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. NBC reported that former intelligence officials said “the agency had gathered reams of documents that could expose unsavory tactics by Russian President Vladimir Putin” and another former official said the US “should   …     expose the financial dealings of Putin and his associates”. Hacking foreign governments  —   including political parties  —   is a US pastime, as even the former   chief Michael Hayden openly admitted this week. “A foreign intelligence service getting the internal emails of a major political party in a major foreign adversary? Game on. That’s what we do,” Hayden said. He added: “By the way, I would not want to be in an American court of law and be forced to deny that I never did anything like that as director of the NSA. ” (Hayden probably doesn’t want to find himself in an American court for a lot of reasons, but that’s another story.) It’s the leaking of documents that is relatively new. The US, of course, has a long history of interfering in foreign elections as well, as Washington Post’s Ishaan Tharoor detailed last week. That’s not to excuse Russia’s alleged actions, but everyone feigning shock and horror over this needs to take a deep breath because we are rapidly spiraling towards not just a digital cold war, but perhaps something far worse. The question a lot of people were asking when this NBC News story came out is: why was it leaked? There’s a couple of possibilities beyond the usual “the CIA can’t keep a secret”  —   which they obviously can when they want to. To me, the most likely scenario is this could be the CIA’s attempt to back President Obama into a corner by putting public pressure on him to approve such an escalation in cyberwarfare. So far, Obama has (commendably) been virtually the only official or politician in DC not to succumb to scaremongering and dramatic cold war 2. 0 rhetoric when it comes to Russia. That hasn’t stopped him from criticizing Putin when he should. But he’s not pretending like Putin is some   chess mastermind, pulling the strings behind every twist and turn in presidential poll numbers, like the rest of Washington. There’s also a chance the whole thing is a ruse, where the CIA purposefully leaks a fake story for the purposes of attempting to scare Russia. But assuming the CIA plans are real, why on earth do all these national security geniuses think this is a good idea? Countless politicians have spent the last four months saying how “unprecedented” and “dangerous” Russia’s actions are, so now the magic solution is to do it back to them? Who thinks that once the US leaks some documents back on Putin that he’ll suddenly be like ‘oh, you got me, I guess we’ll stop!’ The more likely scenario is that this   idea will escalate the cyber tensions rather than act as a deterrent. Remember, Putin reportedly thinks that the Panama Papers leak was the work of the US government (even though there’s no evidence to suggest it was) and some think the current leaks involving US politicians are his revenge. This potential CIA operation will, in his mind, only confirm his suspicions. Putin is also much less susceptible to public pressure than US politicians are (given his alleged   dealings with his opponents) and has increasingly attempted to implement draconian internet surveillance laws which he’ll surely use to his advantage if the US does go through with this plan. Why does the reaction to alleged Russian actions have to turn into a contest in who’s the bigger tough guy? It’s hard to remember that just a year and a half ago, the supposed biggest cyber threat in US history was China. They were alleged to have stolen billions of dollars of intellectual property and then were accused of hacking tens of millions of people’s security review files from the US government going back decades. Instead of saber rattling about an unprecedented wave of   the US government negotiated with China, and the attacks on the US, at least on the hacking of commercial secrets, slowed down significantly. (So much so that cybersecurity defense contractors took a big hit on the stock market. Lucky for them Russia is the new bogeyman!) Russia’s not going to stop gathering intelligence on American political parties just like the US is not going to stop on theirs, but maybe the US should attempt to actually   tensions by starting the process of negotiating some form of an international cyber treaty before this gets too out of control.

Tony Perkins blamed gay people for God’s wrath. His house was swept away
Religions around the world have interpreted natural phenomena as God’s will for as long as we’ve had gods and religions. But in God’s arsenal of punishments, perhaps none are as storied as the flood. In modern times, conservative evangelicals have claimed floods, such as the one that followed Hurricane Katrina in 2005, are God’s punishment for moral decay. By moral decay, they typically mean abortion or homosexuality. One prominent evangelical who’s a fan of this line of thinking is Tony Perkins, the head of the rabidly   Family Research Council. In a 2015 interview with Messianic Jewish pastor Jonathan Cahn, Perkins agreed that Hurricane Joaquin, a devastating storm that hit the Bahamas last year, was “a sign of God’s wrath” punishment for abortion and for the legalization of   marriage. Perkins also frequently compares homosexuality to pedophilia. “It is a homosexual problem,” he said. He also believes “the homosexual community” is engaged in behavior “that will destroy our nation”. As a member of that “homosexual community” who has endured this rhetoric for his entire adult life, I must admit I found it difficult to not raise an eyebrow at the mental image of Tony Perkins paddling in a canoe after his house was swept away in the flood that’s currently affecting Louisiana.  “This is a flood of   proportions,” Perkins said on his radio show. “We had to escape from our home Saturday by canoe. We had about 10 feet of water at the end of our driveway. Our house flooded, a few of our cars flooded. ” Thankfully, none of his family was harmed.  You could be forgiven for thinking of this as some kind of twisted justice, or at least as a delicious bit of divine irony. I’ve been out of the closet long enough that Perkins’ words don’t affect me anymore, but I remember what it was like to read them when I first came out in rural Oklahoma, before   marriage was legalized and before I had other gay people supporting me. It was incredibly painful. It was a reminder of the thing that had kept me in hiding for so long: we are so misunderstood. We are so hated. But to react with glee to news of Perkins’ plight  —   to regard it as comeuppance or karma  —   would, though tempting, be to engage in the toxic   thinking that I loathe in the religious right. This is a flood that has already killed 13 people. This is a flood that, like most natural disasters, disproportionately affect poor people and communities of color. I think of the legacy of Katrina, and how so many communities still haven’t recovered. Natural disasters are a time to come together, a time to put on display the empathy that, I believe, is what makes humanity special. To take a natural disaster as an opportunity to condemn people who are already vulnerable is inhuman in my mind. When I think of how the religious right has done this in the wake of so many tragedies, it makes me angry all over again. They are not examples to be followed. I wish Tony Perkins hadn’t spent so much of his life squarely positioning himself against my thriving and that of my community. I wish Tony Perkins didn’t think of hurricanes and floods as God’s wrath. But I don’t wish harm on him. He’s a person. My hope is that the flood makes Perkins reflect on his past statements. I hope that he contemplates whether or not his actions have truly been Christian.  Tony Perkins and I disagree over whether God sends storms to punish people. I don’t believe that. But if in these events he sees a sign from above to humble himself, I hope he heeds it.

Supreme court reinstates Arizona law banning collection of early ballots
The US supreme court on Saturday reinstated an Arizona law that makes it a felony to collect early ballots, dealing a blow to Democratic     efforts just days before the presidential election. The order from the country’s highest court overturned an appeals court decision from a day earlier that blocked the new law. Democratic groups had already geared up to begin helping voters deliver their ballots to the polls. The supreme court decision calls into question what happens to ballots such groups legally collected from voters in the approximately 20 hours in which the law was blocked. Collecting early ballots is especially effective among minority communities. Democrats allege the law hurts minorities’ ability to vote. The decision comes just days ahead of a presidential election that has Arizona Democrats hoping to win the traditionally Republican state. Arizona filed an emergency appeal, hours after the ninth US circuit court of appeals blocked the law on Friday. Justice Anthony Kennedy referred the case to the entire supreme court, and the court issued a brief order overturning the appeals court ruling. The ninth circuit will now consider the law in a January session that it set when it blocked the law. Republican lawmakers approved the law earlier this year, over the objection of minority Democrats. The GOP governor, Doug Ducey, called it a commonsense effort to protect the integrity of elections and eliminate voter fraud. A split ninth US circuit panel said that by blocking the law, it was preserving the status quo for Tuesday’s election, which could come down to the wire in Arizona as Democrats spend heavily to get out the vote among Latinos and others angered by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s   comments. Chief judge Sidney Thomas wrote that the ninth circuit decision would not add or remove any valid votes. He said the law criminalized delivering someone else’s early ballot, which would still be counted. Both parties have used ballot collection to boost turnout by going door to door and asking voters if they have completed   ballots. Voters who have not are urged to do so, and the volunteers offer to take the ballots to election offices. Democrats, however, use the practice more effectively. The Arizona law does not prevent voters’ family members or caregivers from turning in ballots. The Arizona Republican party chairman, Robert Graham, called Saturday’s decision a smart one since the law had been in effect since before the August primary. Leaving the ninth circuit decision in place would do “nothing more than confuse the voters” he said. Graham also criticized Democratic groups for rushing to collect ballots on Friday, saying they compromised people who might have trusted them to deliver their vote to the polls.

The battle for eastern Aleppo in maps: how rebel territory shrank
The departure of 4, 000 rebel fighters and civilians on Thursday completed the evacuation of what was formerly   eastern Aleppo. They left the last square kilometre of territory which had remained under nominal rebel control after a Russia and   ceasefire effectively ended the battle on 13 December. Since then, about 40, 000 people have left the city amid worsening weather and humanitarian conditions in a fragile and   evacuation operation. Rebels had held eastern Aleppo since 2012, but a year of Russian bombing allowed   forces to gradually encircle their enclave before finally overrunning it in less than a month. With Syria’s civil war far from over, tens of thousands of former Aleppo residents now face a precarious future as refugees in   Idlib. With   Aleppo reduced to a small pocket on the west bank of the Aleppo river and reports of   militias killing civilians in newly captured territory in what the UN called a “meltdown of humanity” Russia and Turkey made a deal to evacuate rebels and civilians to Idlib province. But on the first full day of the ceasefire, renewed shelling and the refusal of the   militias who had led the regime assault to allow the evacuation put it in doubt.  The evacuation of east Aleppo  —   if it goes ahead  —   means the opposition will cede the entire city, Syria’s former commercial capital, to the Assad regime, surrendering the last major urban stronghold where it maintained an active presence.   territory was collapsing rapidly during Monday as   forces continuously rolled back the frontline in eastern Aleppo. Conditions inside the   rebel enclave were described as “doomsday” by one resident, with the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reporting the rebels had already withdrawn from all territory on the east bank of the Aleppo river. The day began with a   advance into the strategic districts of Sheikh Saeed and Saliheen, preceded by some of the most intense bombardment of the war. The fall of these areas alone meant the rebels had lost control of at least 90% of the territory they held before the regime launched its ground offensive just over two weeks ago. The Old City of Aleppo, long a bastion of the Syrian opposition, fell into regime hands after the rebels defending it withdrew fearing being cut off after government soldiers and   militia seized the neighbouring districts of Bab   and Aqyul.   forces also took parts of Marjeh as opposition ranks were reportedly divided on whether to leave the city or make a last stand.   troops moved to within a kilometre of Aleppo’s ancient citadel on Tuesday as   districts continued to fall. With up to 70% of eastern Aleppo now back in regime hands, there was fierce fighting as rebels lost control of more territory east of the narrow streets which surround the citadel. Regime forces built on momentum generated over a second consecutive weekend of heavy bombardment and rapid advances. On Monday, Russia vetoed a draft UN security council resolution calling for a ceasefire, ensuring its ally in Damascus remained free to build on its advantage.   forces led by Iraqi Shia militias and Hezbollah seized control of up to   of   eastern Aleppo after another day of rapid advances. Rebel defences appear to have been fatally weakened since   airstrikes resumed with renewed ferocity nearly two weeks ago. The capture earlier in the day of the strategic Sakhour district consolidated Sunday’s regime gains into a wedge that effectively cut rebel territory in two. This manoeuvre briefly left open a small corridor through which rebels withdrew to a new frontline farther south, before   forces moved to occupy the entire northern third of the rebel enclave. After 12 days of intense preparatory airstrikes, forces supporting the Syrian president, Bashar   launched a major ground assault on   eastern Aleppo. The attack was concentrated on the northern part of the rebel enclave   forces had been consolidating their control north of this frontline since the siege began in late August. Opposition fighters retreated in the face of a regime advance that captured the areas of Jabal Badro and Masaken Hanano, which was the first district taken by rebels in 2012. Thousands of civilians fled to Kurdish and   territory.

Champions League last 16: tie-by-tie analysis
  First leg 21 Feb Second leg 15 Mar, Pep Guardiola will be content with this draw, but Monaco are among the most exciting sides in Europe and perhaps the most underrated team in the competition. Leonardo Jardim has created an exciting side who have scored an incredible 53 goals in 17 Ligue 1 matches. Although Monaco share the goals around impressively, it is notable that Radamel Falcao has found his shooting boots again, scoring five goals in Monaco’s past two games. They are also tactically flexible, able to play both    or     effectively, as they demonstrated with   victories home and away against Tottenham Hotspur in the group stage. City will start as strong favourites, although Monaco is a tough place to go  —   despite, or maybe because of, the famous lack of atmosphere. Prediction Manchester City, First leg 15 Feb Second leg 7 Mar, These sides have not met since the days of Diego Maradona. The European champions Real Madrid are likely to keep up their impressive recent record in the competition: after six years of being eliminated at this stage between 2005 and 2010, they have reached at least the   for the past six seasons, triumphing twice. Napoli’s main goalscoring threat will come from the former Real winger José Callejón, their top goalscorer  —   he cuts in dangerously from wide positions and is a clinical finisher. Dries Mertens and Lorenzo Insigne also offer unpredictable movement, while the   Arkadiusz Milik should return from injury in time for this tie. Real are a strong side, however  —   better than last season in terms of organisation, and still brilliant on the  . Prediction Real Madrid, First leg 14 Feb Second leg 8 Mar, Two European champions meet for the first time in more than half a century. Benfica are a decent side, and while the coach Rui Vitoria is yet to fully demonstrate his tactical acumen in continental competition, Benfica caused Bayern Munich a fright in the competition last season, narrowly defeated   on aggregate at this stage. The Argentinian attacking midfielder Eduardo Salvio has been their stand‑out performer in the competition this season, managing three goals and two assists, and rounded off a brilliant passing move to open the scoring in the   derby victory against Sporting Sunday. Dortmund are a thrilling side, though  —   Thomas Tuchel has created a flexible,   team, and the talents of   Aubameyang, Osumane Dembélé and the returning Marco Reus could overwhelm Benfica. Prediction Borussia Dortmund, First leg 15 Feb Second leg 7 Mar, These two clubs will face one another for the seventh and eighth times in the past five seasons. Bayern eliminated Arsenal at this stage in both   and  . However, the German club are probably weaker now. Although they top the Bundesliga, they are still a work in progress under their new manager, Carlo Ancelotti, and lost against both Atlético Madrid and FC Rostov in the group stage, also falling to a   defeat at Dortmund in the Bundesliga. Arsenal appear more organised and tactically intelligent this season, while the use of Alexis Sánchez up front provides more dynamism. Their task for the first leg in Munich is ensuring they remain in the tie, and the second leg is not simply a familiar exercise in saving face. Prediction Bayern Munich, First leg 22 Feb Second leg 14 Mar, Juventus are probably being underrated  —   they are only seventh favourite for the competition  —   and this is a favourable draw for Max Allegri’s side. Capable of playing with a   defence, a   defence and a hybrid system that can catch out opponents, they have more goal threat after the summer arrival of Gonzalo Higuaín, who is still seeking to prove he can deliver in big games. Porto are, as ever, a slick passing team offering plenty of width, and they have added another dimension to their play with André Silva, a rare prolific Portuguese   managing nine goals in 13 league games this season, and another two in Europe. It remains to be seen whether Porto can frustrate superior opponents, though. Prediction Juventus, First leg 21 Feb Second leg 15 Mar, These sides met at this stage two years ago, both winning   at home before Atlético triumphed on penalties. Tactically, this might be one of the most fascinating ties, with both sides extremely well organised and particularly clever in their pressing. Atlético’s style is suited to European competition and Diego Simeone might prioritise the Champions League with his side seemingly out of the Liga title race. The goalkeeper Jan Oblak and the centre‑back Diego Godín are among the best in Europe, while Yannick Carrasco, Kevin Gameiro and Antoine Griezmann provide tremendous pace up front. Leverkusen are based around the goal‑poaching of Javier Hernández, but with Hakan Calhanoglu’s creativity and dead‑ball expertise, and a combative, mobile midfield, this could be a great contest. Prediction Atlético Madrid, First leg 14 Feb Second leg 8 Mar, Another repeat  —   these sides played twice in   and four times in 2014‑15, with Barcelona rampant in the   two years ago, winning   on aggregate. Barcelona have not been at their best this season, and their midfield passing has been uncharacteristically poor. They are more dependent than ever upon Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suárez for moments of magic  —   but they rarely have quiet games. PSG are struggling in Ligue 1, four points off the pace  —   which might not sound disastrous, but it is a significant decline considering they won the title last season by a ludicrous 31 points. Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s departure means the inconsistent Edinson Cavani leads the line. Marco Verratti, meanwhile, is the type of midfielder Barcelona should be looking to sign. Prediction Barcelona, First leg 22 Feb Second leg 14 Mar, This could be brilliant  —   heavy pressing against  . The Sevilla manager, Jorge Sampaoli has taken his side to third in La Liga with a young, dynamic and cohesive side capable of truly wonderful football. The Italian midfielder Franco Vazquez has been particularly exciting, while Samir Nasri has also thrived and the former Blackburn and Stoke midfielder Steven N’Zonzi plays a solid midfield role for the club who have won three consecutive Europa League titles. Leicester’s league form has been patchy, but their Champions League performances have largely been excellent, while the weekend thrashing of Manchester City showed Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy have not lost their touch. Sevilla will have most of the ball, but Leicester can cause an upset. Prediction Leicester City

NBA national anthem singer kneels and reveals Black Lives Matter T-shirt
A woman performing the national anthem before an NBA preseason game in Miami on Friday protested against racial oppression and police brutality as she did so, kneeling at   and wearing a Black Lives Matter  . Denasia Lawrence opened her jacket just before she started to sing, revealing the shirt, then dropped to her left knee and performed the song. She said it was her way of protesting against racial oppression. “We’re being unjustly killed and overly criminalized,” Lawrence wrote early on Saturday in a Facebook post. “I took the opportunity to sing and kneel to show that we belong in this country and that we have the right to respectfully protest injustices against us. ” Miami Heat officials said they had no advance knowledge of Lawrence’s plan to protest. Lawrence, a social worker, kept the shirt hidden until her performance. “I didn’t get paid to sing the national anthem nor was this moment about any sort of fame,” Lawrence wrote. “Black Lives Matter is far larger than a hashtag. It’s a rallying cry. ” The anthem issue has been a major topic in the sports world in recent months, starting with the decision by San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick not to stand while it is played.  Kaepernick cited racial injustice and police brutality among the reasons for his protest, and athletes from many sports  —   and many levels, from youth all the way to professional  —   have followed his lead in various ways. Heat players and coaches stood side by side for the anthem beforeo their game with Philadelphia, all with their arms linked as has been their custom during the preseason. The team plans to continue standing that way for the anthem this season as a show of unity. “Throughout all of this, I think the most important thing that has come out is the very poignant, thoughtful dialogue,” the Heat’s coach, Erik Spoelstra, said. “We’ve had great dialogue within our walls here and hopefully this will lead to action. ” The NBA has a rule calling for players and coaches to stand during the anthem. “All I can say is what we’ve seen in multiple preseason games so far is our players standing for the national anthem,” the NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, said on Friday in New York. “It would be my hope that they would continue to stand for the national anthem. I think that is the appropriate thing to do. ” The Heat guard Wayne Ellington often speaks about the need to curb gun violence, after his father was shot and killed two years ago. He had his eyes closed for most of the anthem on Friday, as per his own custom, though was aware of Lawrence’s actions. “At the end of the day, to each his own,” Ellington said. “If she feels like that’s the way she wants to stand for it, then more power to her. ” Making a statement in the manner that Lawrence did on Friday is rare, but not unheard of in recent weeks. When the Sacramento Kings played their first home preseason game earlier this month, the anthem singer Leah Tysse dropped to one knee as she finished singing the song. Tysse is white. Lawrence is black. “I love and honor my country as deeply as anyone yet it is my responsibility as an American to speak up against injustice as it affects my fellow Americans,” Tysse wrote on Facebook.  “I have sung the anthem before but this time taking a knee felt like the most patriotic thing I could do. I cannot idly stand by as black people are unlawfully profiled, harassed and killed by our law enforcement over and over and without a drop of accountability. ”

Witness says self-driving Uber ran red light on its own, disputing Uber’s claims
An autonomous Uber malfunctioned while in “  mode” and caused a near collision in San Francisco, according to a business owner whose account raises new safety concerns about the unregulated technology launch. The   car  —   which Uber introduced without permits, as part of a testing program that California has deemed illegal  —   accelerated into an intersection while the light was still red and while the automation technology was clearly controlling the car, said Christopher Koff, owner of local cafe AK Subs. “It looked like the car ran the red light on its own,” Koff, 49, said of the   Uber Volvo, which has a driver in the front seat who can take control when needed. Another car that had the green light had to “slam the brakes” to avoid a crash, he said. Koff’s story, which advocacy group Consumer Watchdog shared with state officials on Tuesday, directly contradicts Uber’s public claims that   violations have been the result of “human error” and that the drivers, not the technology, have failed to follow traffic laws. The new allegations  —   which Uber denied and which cover an incident three weeks ago  —   have come to light days after the corporation openly refused to adhere to California regulations, claiming that its defiance of government was an “issue of principle”.  Uber’s autonomous cars were first spotted on San Francisco streets in September, but the company formally launched a pilot program to riders last week. California officials have repeatedly said the   corporation, which is headquartered in San Francisco, needs testing permits, noting that 20 other companies have followed protocols.  But Uber has ignored attorney general Kamala Harris’s threat of legal action, claiming it does not need permits since the vehicles have drivers monitoring and citing the cars’ “   ” technology and “core safety capabilities”.  Koff’s account, however, suggests that the products may not be ready for the road and that safety mechanisms are insufficient.  It was around 5am local time, and Koff said he was standing 10ft away from the vehicle when he saw it stopped at a light. While the driver was talking to a passenger, who had a laptop out, the car suddenly drove forward into the red, according to Koff. The driver’s hands were not on the wheel, he added. “He was not driving. It was in   mode,” said Koff. He noted that it was foggy at the time and that there were construction trucks nearby shining yellow lights that could have possibly interfered with the technology.  It would not be the first time the computer in a   vehicle made a basic error with potentially   consequences.  In May, the “autopilot sensors” on a Tesla Motors car failed to distinguish a white   crossing the highway against a bright sky, leading to the first known death caused by a   car.  Uber also admitted to the Guardian on Monday that its San Francisco cars have a “problem” with the way they cross bike lanes, and the company’s   cars in Pittsburgh have reportedly collided with other cars and driven the wrong way on a street.  Spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler declined to provide details about Koff’s claims and sent the Guardian a statement identical to the one she provided last week, citing “human error” adding: “This is why we believe so much in making the roads safer by building   Ubers. ” Kohler did not respond to questions about how the company knows the driver was at fault and whether he faced consequences. Last week, she said two drivers had been suspended after the   vehicles had been recorded running red lights.  Critics have argued that regardless of whether violations occur in   mode or while a human is in control, Uber needs to be responsible for dangers posed by its cars  —   and should be embracing regulators, not shunning them.  “Someone could be hurt or maimed or paralyzed for the rest of their life because we’re trying to rush something out there,” said Koff, noting that he also recently saw a driver in an autonomous Uber scramble to take control when it was trying to navigate around a nearby bus and an approaching ambulance.  John M Simpson, privacy project director for Consumer Watchdog, who filed a report based on Koff’s incident, said he suspects Uber does not want to follow regulations that would require it to disclose details about errors to the government. “Being able to understand the traffic signal and respond appropriately is a key requirement of any     technology,” said Simpson, who has called for criminal charges against Uber. “It obviously failed that test. ”

Calais: French and British officials keep passing the buck to the very end
The final chapter of the Calais debacle promises to be as depressing as those that preceded it. With around 1, 500 teenage refugees still held in shipping containers on the smouldering site waiting for a decision on their future, French and British officials have embarked on a   flurry of undignified diplomatic   over who should be responsible for them. For the past 18 months both governments have behaved appallingly in their failure to address the crisis this disorganised denouement is merely the predictable continuation of the chaos that went before. The refusal of both governments to resolve what was (from a global refugee crisis perspective) a very small problem was startling. In the past year 1. 4m asylum applications have been made in Europe 641, 000 of them in Germany, 142, 000 of them in Sweden. The scale of the Calais site should have been easily manageable. Instead the crisis was ignored and the camp became a uniquely horrific spot. With no proper water supplies, sewage systems or electricity and only   tents for shelter, it felt worse than the worst slums of Mumbai, and yet it was overlooked by comfortable suburban houses, just half a kilometre from the town’s cheerful   bistros. Conditions were worse than in camps set up in disaster and war zones because of the absence of any mainstream charity or official French involvement in providing food or shelter for its   inhabitants. A network of grassroots charities stepped in to try to help some were brilliant, some much less so. It was disturbing to see responsibility for providing food and shelter for thousands fall on the shoulders of volunteers. Refugees could not conceal their dismay when they arrived. The smell of burning plastic and raw sewage was overpowering. In the summer there were piles of   dead rats on the pathways. In the winter, families slept in wooden shacks that let in the rain. Most striking was the large number of lone child refugees, dispatched by their parents to seek safety in Europe. British tabloids have raged with scepticism about the ages of the children and the motivations of their parents, but over the course of numerous trips over the past year I met dozens of children aged between 8 and 16, who had spent months living in total squalor, hoping to join relatives in the UK. Volunteers collected accounts of   of children and documented cases of children hit by rubber bullets shot by riot police. But the bigger scandal was that hundreds of children were left to live in a   field, some for over a year, with no help from the French or British governments. While both countries were languidly debating who should take responsibility, vulnerable   with family in the UK were taking matters into their own hands, and trying to get to Britain illegally they risked their lives most nights trying to hurl themselves on to lorries, hiding in refrigerated containers  —   usually unsuccessfully, sometimes with fatal consequences. There is no memorial for the 14 refugees who died this year except the understated list kept by the local prefect’s office  —   the file includes Raheemullah Oryakhel, the    from Afghanistan who died when he fell from a moving lorry and was hit by a car (the driver did not stop). It lists a “migrant whose sex could not be identified, found drowned in the port of Calais” an “Afghan migrant 22 years, hit by an HGV on the A16” and an “   female Eritrean found dead on the ring road near junction 47”. Most of these deaths went unreported. When the Guardian wrote about Raheemullah’s death, the coverage attracted some no longer surprising vitriol, with tweets commenting “Good” and “One less to worry about”. One of the most dispiriting aspects of writing about the refugee crisis has been this exposure to the   of public hostility to a group of people who have mostly spent the last year fleeing violence. While it is good that the British government has begun to accept some responsibility, the disparity in the numbers housed by the French (6, 000) and the 274 children given shelter by the UK speaks for itself. The president of the local regional council, Xavier Bertrand, joined Bernard Cazeneuve, France’s home office minister, in criticising the British response, describing it as insufficient.  As work progresses swiftly on the £1. 9m UK and French      wall, designed to stop a new Calais camp from forming, it would be nice to think that homes could be found for the remaining refugee children with equal speed and efficiency.

Police helicopter crashes amid shootouts in Rio
Just months after hosting the Olympics, the west zone of Rio de Janeiro resembled a war zone this weekend as a police helicopter crashed amid shootouts and   murders that left at least 12 people dead. Gunfire was reported in half a dozen locations across the city, highlighting fears of a public security crisis worsened by budget cuts, striking police, a change of government and uncertainties over the future of the favela “pacification” policy. The worst clashes occurred in and around the Cidade de Deus (City of God) favela, a few miles from the Olympic Park, which just three months ago was celebrating the success of the local judoka Rafaela Silva in winning Brazil’s first gold medal.  On Saturday, however, the community echoed with the sound of gunfire as gangs and police fought their deadliest battle in several years, which started at 7am and continued through the night.  One mobile phone video shows a police helicopter flying low over the favela as a volley of shots rings out. A voice says: “We brought the eagle down” amid cheering. Other clips show the helicopter crashing and locals staring at the wreckage.  The state government said four officers were killed in the crash, the cause of which is under investigation. Initial reports suggest none of those on board was hit by bullets. Following the downing of the helicopter, extra military police flooded into the Cidade de Deus, arresting four residents and seizing weapons. Soon after, seven bodies of local young men were found, some of whom appeared to have been murdered in   killings. Residents blamed police for indiscriminate   retribution. There are also claims that they were killed in fights between gangs. The public security office of the state government did not respond to the Guardian’s request for a response to these allegations.  The police operation is ongoing and residents in parts of the Jacarepaguá region have been warned not to leave their homes. If it is proved that the police helicopter was brought down by gunfire, it would be the first time it has happened in Rio since 2009.  Over the following few years, the city’s security situation briefly improved thanks to the favela “pacification” policy, a stronger economy and changed policing priorities (such as giving rewards for low crime rates rather than killings of “traffickers”). These gains, however, are disappearing as a result of budget cuts, late payment of wages and reports of police violence. There were 3, 649 reported murders in the first nine months of this year, up 18% on the same period in 2015. Public security experts warn that the police could now be returning to the repressive tactics of the past. According to Amnesty International, police are responsible for 2, 500 deaths in the past seven years. Human Rights Watch says   of all killings in the city are carried out by police.   of the victims are black men.  Funerals will be held on Monday for the four officers who died in the helicopter, along with a military policeman who was shot in the operation in Jacarepaguá region.

Spider-Man: Homecoming trailer – eight things we learned
 ’s impish cameo in Captain America: Civil War turned doubters into true believers. After two middling Amazing   movies starring the unfortunate Andrew Garfield, Marvel managed to make the masked   feel fresh again, merely by introducing him into a more colourful and diverse universe of superheroes where Spidey is no longer required to beat up Flash Thompson, or grieve for Uncle Ben, every second movie. But can the   studio restore the webslinger to his rightful position on the tallest plinth in the comic book movie pantheon when he no longer has dozens of former or future Avengers for company? Here are eight takeaways from our first look at  : Homecoming. As promised by Marvel, this is a genuinely green, high    . Unlike either of his   predecessors  —   Tobey Maguire was 27 when he first played the role Andrew Garfield 29  —   at 20 years old, British actor Tom Holland looks like he really could still be a teenager. That marks  : Homecoming out nicely from the rest of the   MCU and ensures the new Peter Parker needn’t be rushed into   membership of The Avengers. Thanks to a previous teaser trailer, we already knew that the     Spidey is continuing to get tactical support from Robert Downey Jr’s Tony Stark following the events of Civil War. Presumably this Steve   winged suit is useful when you’re taking on a menacing flying monster, otherwise known as Michael Keaton’s villainous Vulture. Marvel’s ability to show Iron Man’s gradual transition from arrogant overreacher to chastened     over the course of a half dozen movies may just be one of the most impressive aspects of its pioneering cinematic universe. During his run as the   hero, Robert Downey Jr’s Tony Stark has saved the world from alien invaders, then helped usher in an artificial intelligence that nearly destroyed the planet. The genius billionaire has fought alongside Captain America, then battled against the patriotic hero. So it should come as no surprise that he makes a rather hesitant mentor to Peter Parker, especially as Stark isn’t really the avuncular type. Where’s Nick Fury when you need him? Stark suddenly seems unsure whether Parker’s ready for superhero duties, which seems a bit rich given he was ready to call on the MCU’s newest hero to battle the likes of Captain America, The Winter Soldier and Falcon during the events of Civil War. There has been some suggestion that  : Homecoming might straddle the events of the earlier episode, rather than taking place after it, which would make sense of the older man’s cautious approach. Bad villains have always killed   movies, from The Amazing  ’s   Lizard to the awful triple whammy of Venom, Sandman and James Franco’s junior Green Goblin in Sam Raimi’s   final turn in the hot seat,   3. But Michael Keaton’s Vulture, all hellish insectoid carapace, freaky   and those infernal emerald peepers, already looks like an impressively scary specimen. He may not be the most famous of Spidey villains, but Keaton’s first comic book movie turn since 1992’s Batman Returns could change all that in a whisk of those   wings. The fanboy blogosphere (including myself)  —   and even the great Stan Lee  —   might need to ready ourselves for a giant    moment. When usually reliable Hollywood trade bible The Wrap “confirmed” in August that the pop star and actor would be playing Peter Parker’s perennial paramour, the news generated scores of pieces praising the casting of an African American actor in the traditionally   role. The only problem is, Zendaya doesn’t appear to be playing MJ after all: the distinctly    young woman berating Peter Parker and his pal in the trailer is rumoured to be named Michele. Could she be Michele Gonzalez,   and sometime love interest for Spidey in the comics? To be fair, Zendaya has continued to insist that she is not playing MJ, and it’s looking increasingly unlikely that this is yet another example of “I am Khan”  smoke and mirrors. Making Mary Jane   made sense because Queens, where Spidey lives and goes to school, boasted a   white population of just 26. 2% in 2014, the date of the most recent census. But looking around the new Midtown high, this does seem to be a more realistic rendition than we’ve seen before in the Sony movies. Parker’s best friend Ned Leeds is played by the Asian American actor Jacob Batalon, while rumored love interest Liz Allan is portrayed by African American actor Laura Harrier. An even better known member of the Spidey supporting cast, Flash Thompson, will be played by The Grand Budapest Hotel’s splendid Tony Revolori, who is of Guatemalan descent.  Regular Marvel observers wondered if Tony Stark might keep the   firmly locked away for a while in the wake of Civil War’s bruising   battles. But given the cost of hiring Downey Jr, it was probably inevitable that Iron Man would find himself swooping through the Manhattan skyline at some point. Is the Vulture simply too powerful for one teenage superhero to take down alone?

Jaime Jarrín: the remarkable story of the Latino Vin Scully
They come with their fathers, they come with their mothers. They come with their grandmothers and grandfathers and uncles and aunts, some of them dabbing tears from their eyes. They stand outside the Vin Scully Press Box at the LA Dodgers’ stadium on Vin Scully Avenue waiting not for Vin Scully, known as baseball’s greatest announcer, but for the Spanish language Vin Scully the voice of their lives. And when he emerges from the elevator, they embrace him and ask for photos and then they beg that he never, ever leaves. “So many people they come up to me and say: ‘My father used to hear you, my grandfather, my grandmother . .. and so we started growing up together,’” the Dodgers Spanish language broadcaster Jaime Jarrín says softly. “It really pleases me to hear that. ” Lost behind the   farewell to Scully is remarkable story. It’s a story many baseball fans don’t know because when they think of the Dodgers they think only of Scully, the team’s narrator for nearly 70 seasons and a man who calls games in such vivid detail he was voted into the Hall of Fame more than 30 years ago. Even as they mourn Scully’s October retirement, they have barely heard of the regal    legend in Scully’s shadow. Nor do they realize that for 58 years, millions of southern California Latinos have had a Vin Scully of their own. And that without him the Dodgers might not be the $2bn franchise they’ve become. “I think we opened the door to some organizations to realize how important the Latino market is,” Jarrín says. And that market matters. In the winter of 1958 Walter O’Malley moved his Brooklyn Dodgers to Los Angeles. Being a businessman he looked around the vast, booming city and he saw opportunity in immigrants from Central and South America with no understanding of American sports. He would make them baseball fans by not only broadcasting each game in English but in Spanish too. No team had ever done something like this before, putting every game on Spanish radio. But O’Malley dreamed that someday these new fans would flock to the stadium he was building on a hill above downtown LA  —   a hill   by Mexican immigrants who had been pulled from their homes in part for the ballpark’s construction. The man who came to be O’Malley’s Spanish broadcaster barely knew baseball then. He was 23 years old and had arrived three years before on a boat from Ecuador. But soon Jarrín was telling the same Dodger story as Scully, only to an audience that didn’t know Scully. And they did listen, And they did come to his ballpark on the hill, driving from places like Bakersfield and Fresno, several hours away, lured by the story of a team that Jarrín told nightly. Now nearly half of the Dodger Stadium crowd is Latino, and a little less then half of that group speak Spanish as their first language. “In the Mexican community in Southern California, I don’t know if Jaime is   but he’s at least a notch below,” says Charley Steiner, who broadcasts Dodgers games in English. Then he laughs. “I’m so lucky,” Steiner continues. “I have two of the greatest broadcasters of all time to go to work with every day. ” Jarrín stands outside the Nationals Park press box on a scorching Washington afternoon watching the Dodgers take batting practice. He still travels with the Dodgers, covering every game on every trip. His only exception is a small vacation he takes each summer. He figures that he’s earned the right after more than five decades. Otherwise he keeps flying on the planes, moving from hotel to hotel, climbing press box staircases because he enjoys the grind of baseball and the camaraderie of being around a team. He wants to do this for two more seasons, until he reaches his 60th in the game before deciding if he will cut back. His wife, Blanca, who he married long ago back home in Ecuador continues to let him go. He promises her he will stop the moment she asks. So far she hasn’t. Maybe she understands how vital his voice is to a population that looks forward to hearing it the way LA’s   fans take comfort in Scully’s. “I am so blessed doing what I do,” he says. “I have the best seat in the house and [am] respected by my colleagues. I respect everybody in the organization, I demand respect and they do that, I am very well paid. The main thing is: I love what I do. Most people hate what they do. ” A few years ago, Jaime’s son Jorge became his broadcast partner. Each morning they have lunch together and share a ride to the stadium where they sit    switching every three innings. Jorge talks a lot about statistics and Jaime likes that. It allows him to tell stories. To him, his nightly conversation with Southern California is a public service. He knows his listeners. They are the working people the ones who leave home at 6am and don’t come back until after 5pm. They are tired by day’s end, they need a diversion and his Dodger broadcasts are their refuge. “It’s a chance for me to give them something they can enjoy,” he says. “Something that can really relax them. ” He constantly worries about doing that. He is a worker too. For years he did radio news stories for Spanish language station KWKW in Pasadena, in addition to baseball, only giving it up a decade ago. He has covered riots and protests and presidents. He was the only   reporter to be at John F Kennedy’s funeral, flying to Washington that day without a credential and calling on a Latino congressman who got him a pass and a car within an hour. He became the first   journalist in Southern California to win a Golden Mike Award for his coverage of the 1970 Chicano Moratorium. He later won another. For a few years, he was also the sports director at Telemundo 52 in LA, giving the job up when he found he loved radio more than TV. He remembers a   period where he worked from 4am to 1am six days a week and he wonders now how he managed to keep going. But then Jarrín was aways a newsman. His first radio job came when he was 15 reading news and writing scripts for station HCJB  —   “The Voice of the Andes”  —   in his hometown of Quito, Ecuador. Two years later, he was the official announcer for the Ecuadoran senate. He could have had that job forever but he longed for something bigger. Bianca, who he married at 18, urged him to search saying she would follow wherever he went. That opportunity came when after interviewing the American consul in Quito, he told the man: “I want to emigrate to the United States. ” Three days later Jarrín had a visa. He bought his passage on a boat bound for Florida, and sailed through the Panama Canal. Twice the ship was rocked by huge storms that kept him trapped below deck for three days. He got sick. But when the boat finally reached America the first thing he saw was a great bridge traversing Tampa Bay and he thought: “Any country that can build something like this can do anything” He was torn about what to do in his new homeland choosing between flight school in New Jersey, or a radio career in Los Angeles. He picked LA and arrived on 24 June 1955, the same day as Sandy Koufax’s big league debut. For six months he worked in a factory making metal fences while trying to convince KWKW to hire him. Eventually they did. Bianca joined him and by 1958, he was the station’s news and sports director, broadcasting Thursday night boxing at the Olympic Auditorium. One day the manager called everyone into his office and told them O’Malley wanted the station to call the Dodgers games in Spanish. Jarrín, the manager said, would be one of the announcers even though he knew almost nothing bout baseball. “Don’t worry,” the station manager told him, he would have a year to learn. And so Jarrín spent that first summer of the LA Dodgers listening to their games on the radio. When the 1959 season began, he sat with his first partner Rene Cardenas in a makeshift pressbox in the LA Coliseum’s stands. In front of them were Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra. He was 23 years old and a long way from writing scripts and reading news in Quito. “So as you see, I never applied for the [Dodgers] job,” Jarrín says with a chuckle. “I never looked for the job. It was extended on a silver platter. ” He thought he would do it for six or seven years. Instead he never stopped, toiling all those years in Scully’s world, invisible to Scully’s listeners. And now he is sad that Scully will soon be gone. “Vin has been my mentor, my idol, my friend,” he says. “I don’t have words to say how I feel towards Vin Scully. ” When Jarrín was young and new to baseball, Scully gave him two vital lessons: Prepare for every game as if it is your first and never get too close to the players. Everything he has done as a baseball broadcaster has been built around those words. For the first eight years the Dodgers were in Los Angeles he and Cardenas didn’t travel to road games. Instead they did   from the KWKW studios. A special line was set up to the ballpark in New York or Chicago or wherever the Dodgers were playing. An hour before the game, Scully would get on the line and gave Jarrín details about the weather and the crowd and what the Dodgers players and coaches had said that day. Then when the game started, the Spanish broadcasters listened through headphones to the broadcast of Scully and his partner, Jerry Doggett, trying to repeat in Spanish what they were hearing in English. And something wonderful happened to Jarrín during all those nights listening to Scully in his headphones. He started to sound like Scully. When Scully told stories, he told stories. When Scully described the way the stadium felt or how the pitcher stalked the mound, he did too. For a young man new to America and even newer to baseball there was no better teacher than the announcer who would be the best. He learned things from a distance he would never have known if he had travelled to the games. “You have to realize he was translating Vin’s words and if you are translating Vin Scully for eight years you are going to become Vin Scully,” his son, Jorge, says. Standing now, on the balcony at Nationals Park, Jaime Jarrín looks away, gazing out toward the field and the players finishing batting practice. “It’s impossible to copy Vin,” he says. “But I adopted his style. He was such a big part of me. He gave me so much confidence at my work. He gave me so many lessons that I adopted his style. I am like him. I am not a screamer. I pray to God to give me the quality of watching what is going on with my eyes, not with my heart and I try to be very impartial. ” Which he has been. With the exception of one player. His name was Fernando Valenzuela and he arrived from the tiny Mexican town of Etchohuquila in September 1980, a portly   pitcher, all of 19 years old who rolled his eyes heavenward every time he threw the ball. Almost nobody had ever heard of him. By the next spring, Valenzuela was the biggest thing in baseball winning his first eight games, five by shutout. What followed was like nothing Jarrín had ever seen before or since.   fans filled Dodger Stadium on the nights Valenzuela pitched. The organist played bullfighting music and everyone shouted “Ole!” One night a woman ran onto the field wearing a Fernando shirt and kissed the pitcher. For the first time baseball had a transformative Latino star. Nobody, not even Roberto Clemente, had seized the nation the way Valenzuela did in the first weeks of the 1981 season. Every place the Dodgers went they had to set up special press conferences for Valenzuela, who spoke no English. The team needed a translator so they asked Jarrín. “It was like a dream,” Jarrín says of those months. “What Fernando did for baseball is amazing. I think that he is the one single player who created more baseball fans than any other player. It doesn’t matter if it is Willie Mays or Roberto Clemente or Stan Musial or whatever because thousands and thousands of Mexicans, Central Americans, South Americans were very, very indifferent to baseball. They didn’t care about baseball. They were big on soccer and boxing  —   that’s it. But thanks to Fernando he created so much enthusiasm and created so much interest, especially among ladies, mothers and grandmothers and grandfathers. Everybody became Fernando followers and later on Dodger followers and baseball followers. ” Suddenly everything changed. So many new Spanish speakers came to Jarrín’s broadcasts wanting to know about this Mexican star. His ratings grew. As time went on the crowds at the ballpark changed too. Not only did Latino fans show up on days Fernando pitched, they came every game, buying tickets in   blocks. Then their children grew up and brought their children until the Dodgers were no longer a Fernando fad but a culture passed down through generations. The number of Latinos in the stands soared from the 8% when the Dodgers first came to LA and kept growing until today where they make up  % of the crowd on any given day. More people heard Jarrín’s broadcasts. More people knew his name. And in 1998 he was elected to the broadcaster’s wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame, just as Scully had been many years before. He went to Cooperstown for the induction ceremony, and was led into a room only for Hall of Famers. Nobody else was allowed inside. Not family. Not staff. Just the tiny handful of men who had been great enough to earn the game’s highest honor. There he was, Jaime Jarrín who came from Ecuador on a boat in 1955, never having seen a baseball game in his life, standing beside Stan Musial and Willie Mays. “I appreciate that because it’s very unique,” Jarrín says. “The Dodgers with two Hall of Famers working simultaneously  —   the only organization that has two Hall of Famers. And to be near [Scully] and near the titans of our sport. .. ” He shakes his head. Who could have imagined? “It was destiny first of all that got him here,” Jorge Jarrín says. “First of all, it was destiny that got him to Los Angeles and it was destiny that he got to a radio station that said: ‘you’re going to do the games, this will be good for you, you are the guy to do it.’ That was in 1958 and he’s still doing it in 2016. That’s a book. That’s a movie. ” The improbable story of a young man in Quito who took a boat to America and moved millions to love baseball.

Konrad Reuland, former Ravens and Jets tight end, dies aged 29
The Baltimore Ravens say former tight end Konrad Reuland has died at the age of 29 following a brain aneurysm. Coach John Harbaugh opened his   news conference after Monday night’s loss to the New England Patriots by announcing Reuland’s death. Reuland was attempting to recover from a brain aneurysm he suffered last month. A Ravens spokesman says Reuland’s mother informed the team that he died Monday. “We love Konrad Reuland,” Harbaugh said. “Every single guy in that locker room loves him that knows him. ” Harbaugh offered his condolences to Reuland’s family and quoted from the book of Psalms, saying: “God is our refuge and our strength. ” Besides the Ravens, Reuland spent time with the San Francisco 49ers, Indianapolis Colts and New York Jets. He played in 30 games total over three seasons, catching 12 passes for 90 yards. Reuland signed with San Francisco as an undrafted free agent out of Stanford in 2011. He was claimed off waivers by the New York Jets in 2012 and had 12 catches for 90 yards in two seasons while being used as a blocking tight end and   with childhood friend Mark Sanchez at quarterback. Reuland’s 2013 season was cut short when he was placed on injured reserve with a knee injury after playing in 10 games. He signed with Indianapolis’ practice squad in 2014, but was released and then signed by Baltimore to the Ravens’ practice squad a few weeks later. After being cut a few times, Reuland was   by Baltimore and promoted to the active roster last December. Reuland became a free agent last offseason when the Ravens rescinded their exclusive rights tender offer in May. He signed with Indianapolis in July for a second stint with the Colts, who released him among their final training camp cuts in August.

Sporting KC coach demands apology from MLS after Seattle’s late winner
 Nelson Valdez found a perfect moment to snap his scoring drought. Valdez scored his first MLS goal in nearly a full year with an   header to give the Seattle Sounders a   victory over Sporting Kansas City on Thursday night, and send them into the Western Conference  . With Seattle pressing for a winner in the closing minutes of regulation, Joevin Jones’s cross found Valdez at the near post, and his header easily beat goalkeeper Tim Melia. “It’s felt like there’s been a big mountain on top of me all season. Finally, with the goal, that mountain went away,” Valdez said. It was Valdez’s first MLS goal since 28 October 2015, against the Los Angeles Galaxy in the knockout round of last year’s playoffs. Valdez has had numerous chances during the season but finally made it count, even though it appeared on replay he may have been offside. It was Seattle’s only shot on goal in the match and the only goal scored by the Sounders in three matches against Sporting KC this season. Seattle will face FC Dallas in the Western Conference  . Game 1 of the   series is Sunday in Seattle. “I can’t think of a better person to be rewarded for this moment,” Seattle interim coach Brian Schmetzer said. “He has worked so hard all year long. ” For Sporting KC it was another crushing postseason defeat that left coach Peter Vermes disappointed in the outcome and furious at the officiating. Vermes said MLS owes his club an apology for the officiating, claiming Valdez was offside for his goal Matt Besler was onside when his goal was disallowed early in the second half and Seattle’s Osvaldo Alonso should have been given a second yellow card and sent off midway through the second half. “The statistics don’t lie in this game. We dominated the game from beginning to end,” Vermes said. “Like I said, they scored their goal on an offside play. Changes the outcome of the game. I would tell you in my opinion and for our organization, PRO and Major League Soccer owe our club an absolute apology because that game was taken away from us. ” Nearly a year to the day, Sporting KC were back in the knockout round of the MLS playoffs, again in the Pacific Northwest and trying to erase the memory of the memorable shootout loss to Portland that went through 11 rounds of penalty kicks before the Timbers finally won,. Kansas City had the majority of the possessions and chances in the first half, pushing for an early lead and only being kept off the scoreboard thanks to Seattle goalkeeper Stefan Frei. Paulo Nagamura had two early chances that were punched away by Frei  —   the second save rebounded out for an attempt from Graham Zusi that beat Frei to the far post but ricocheted off the outside of the post and went out for a goal kick. Kansas City appeared to take the lead in the 53rd minute when Besler’s diving header off Benny Feilhaber’s free kick beat Frei. But Besler was flagged for being offside and replays showed he was barely ahead of the Seattle defenders before the ball was played. Feilhaber was the best player on the field most of the night, causing headaches for Seattle wherever he roamed. He dribbled through most of Seattle’s defense in the 80th minute, only to be denied at the very end by another key save from Frei. Meanwhile, in Washington, Matteo Mancosu scored twice and Montreal beat DC United   in their knockout match. The   Impact will host the   New York Red Bulls on Sunday in the first game of the   Eastern Conference  . Laurent Ciman scored early, and Ignacio Piatti made it   for the Impact in the 83rd minute. Lamar Neagle and Taylor Kemp scored for   United, both after the 89th minute.

All the US presidents’ reading lists
Barack Obama revealed his annual holiday reading list this week, at last solving the mystery of who is the one remaining person on earth who still hasn’t read The Girl on the Train. Along with Paula Hawkins’ novel, he is taking Helen Macdonald’s memoir H Is for Hawk the Pulitzer   book about surfing, Barbarian Days The Underground Railroad, a fictionalised history by Colson Whitehead and the   novel Seveneves, to Martha’s Vineyard. Obama’s holiday picks are always guaranteed a sales boost, but he is not the first president to enjoy a good book. According to the policy adviser Karl Rove, he and George W Bush had an annual reading competition, averaging about two books a week, with Bush’s taste extending from political biographies (he read 14 of Lincoln alone while he was in the White House) to fiction (including Camus’ The Stranger) to YA (Ana’s Story,   by his daughter Jenna). The bigger reader, though, was Laura Bush, a former school librarian, whose life is itself fictionalised in Curtis Sittenfeld’s American Wife. Both Clintons’ reading lists show that they are fans of Maya Angelou, but while Bill counts Hillary’s Living History among his favourite political books, Hillary names George W Bush’s Decision Points as hers. When he was elected president, Bill Clinton overruled a travel ban on Gabriel García Márquez, whose novel One Hundred Years of Solitude he had loved since law school, and the two became friends. But, Clinton confessed, really he was addicted to mysteries. According to Tevi Troy, the author of What Jefferson Read, Ike Watched, and Obama Tweeted: 200 Years of Popular Culture in the White House, Richard Nixon and George HW Bush were big fans of Tolstoy JFK was mad about Bond and Ronald Reagan loved westerns. But his recommendation (“a perfect yarn”) was partly responsible for making Tom Clancy’s The Hunt for Red October a bestseller. Unfortunately for the bookselling industry, Donald Trump has no time to read. “I never have,” he has said. But a US publisher is currently putting together a   collection about the Republican nominee. “Writers should submit stories ranging from depictions of his absurdity to the impact of his politics on the disenfranchised, our international friends, and world peace,” requests itsalltrumpedup. com. The deadline for submissions is 31 August.

What if nature, like corporations, had the rights of a person?
In recent years, the US supreme court has solidified the concept of corporate personhood. Following rulings in such cases as Hobby Lobby and Citizens United, US law has established that companies are, like people, entitled to certain rights and protections. But that’s not the only instance of extending legal rights to nonhuman entities. New Zealand took a radically different approach in 2014 with the Te Urewera Act which granted an    forest the legal status of a person. The forest is sacred to the Tūhoe people, an indigenous group of the Maori. For them Te Urewera is an ancient and ancestral homeland that breathes life into their culture. The forest is also a living ancestor. The Te Urewera Act concludes that “Te Urewera has an identity in and of itself” and thus must be its own entity with “all the rights, powers, duties, and liabilities of a legal person”. Te Urewera holds title to itself. Although this legal approach is unique to New Zealand, the underlying reason for it is not. Over the last 15 years I have documented similar cultural expressions by Native Americans about their traditional, sacred places. As an anthropologist, this research has often pushed me to search for an answer to the profound question: What does it mean for nature to be a person? A majestic mountain sits not far   of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Like a low triangle, with long gentle slopes, Mount Taylor is clothed in rich forests that appear a velvety   from the distance. Its bald summit, more than 11, 000 feet high, is often blanketed in snow  —   a reminder of the blessing of water, when seen from the blazing desert below. The Zuni tribe lives about 40 miles west of Mount Taylor. In 2012, I worked with a team to interview 24 tribal members about the values they hold for Dewankwin K’yaba:chu Yalanne (“In the East   Mountain”) as Mount Taylor is called in the Zuni language. We were told that their most ancient ancestors began an epic migration in the Grand Canyon. Over millennia they migrated across the   with important medicine societies and clans living around Mount Taylor. After settling in their current pueblo homes, Zunis returned to this sacred mountain to hunt animals like deer and bear, harvest wild plants like acorns and cattails, and gather minerals used in sacrosanct rituals that keep the universe in order. Across the generations Dewankwin Kyaba:chu Yalanne has come to shape Zuni history, life and identity no less than the Vatican has for Catholics. But unlike holy places in the western world, Zunis believe Mount Taylor is a living being. Zuni elders told me that the mountain was created within the Earth’s womb. As a mountain formed by volcanic activity, it has always grown and aged. The mountain can give life as people do. The mountain’s snow melts in spring and nourishes plants and wildlife for miles. Water is the mountain’s blood buried minerals are the mountain’s meat. Because it lives, deep below is its beating heart. Zunis consider Mount Taylor to be their kin. There is a stereotype that Native American peoples have a singular connection to nature. And yet in my experience, they do see the world in a fundamentally different way from most people I know. Whether it is mountains, rivers, rocks, animals, plants, stars or weather, they see the natural world as living and breathing, deeply relational, even at times   and transcendent. In my work with Arizona’s Hopi tribe, I have traveled with cultural leaders to study sacred places. They often stop to listen to the wind, or search the sky for an eagle, or smile when it begins to rain, which they believe is a blessing the ancestors bestow upon them. During one project with the Hopi tribe, we came across a rattlesnake coiled near an ancient fallen pueblo. “Long ago, one of them ancestors lived here and turned into a rattlesnake,” the elder Raleigh H Puhuyaoma Sr shared with me, pointing to the nearby archaeological site. “It’s now protecting the place. ” The elders left an offering of cornmeal to the snake. An elder later told me that it soon rained on his cornfield, a result from this spiritual exchange. Understanding these cultural worldviews matters greatly in discussions over protecting places in nature. The American west has a long history of battles over the control of land. We’ve seen this recently from the Bundy family’s takeover of the federal wildlife refuge in Oregon to the current fight over turning Bears Ears  —   1. 9 million acres of wilderness  —   into a national monument in Utah. Yet often these battles are less about the struggle between private and public interests, and more about basic questions of nature’s purpose. Do wild places have intrinsic worth? Or is the land a mere tool for human uses? Much of my research has involved documenting sacred places because they are being threatened by development projects on public land. The Zuni’s sacred Mount Taylor, much of it managed by the US National Forest Service, has been extensively mined for uranium, and is the cause of violent disputes over whether it should be developed or protected. Even though the US does not legally recognize natural places as people, some legal protections exist for sacred places. Under the National Historic Preservation Act, for example, the US government must take into consideration the potential impacts of certain development projects on “traditional cultural properties”. This and other federal heritage laws, however, provide tribes with a small voice in the process, little power, and rarely lead to preservation. More to the point, these laws reduce what tribes see as living places to “properties” obscuring their inherent spiritual value. In New Zealand, the Te Urewera Act offers a higher level of protection, empowering a board to be the land’s guardian. The Te Urewera Act, though, does not remove its connection to humans. With a permit, people can hunt, fish, farm and more. The public still has access to the forest. One section of the law even allows Te Urewera to be mined. Te Urewera teaches us that acknowledging cultural views of places as living does not mean ending the relationship between humans and nature, but reordering it  —   recognizing nature’s intrinsic worth and respecting indigenous philosophies. In the US and elsewhere, I believe we can do better to align our legal system with the cultural expressions of the people it serves. For instance, Congress could amend the NHPA or the American Indian Religious Freedom Act to acknowledge the deep cultural connection between tribes and natural places, and afford better protections for sacred landscapes like New Mexico’s Mount Taylor. Until then, it says much about us when companies are considered people before nature is. This article originally appeared on The Conversation

San Francisco counters Trump rhetoric with move for non-citizen local voting
Politicians in San Francisco are hoping that a backlash to Donald Trump’s   rhetoric will motivate local voters to move in the opposite direction and grant   the right to vote. An amendment to the city charter will be placed on the ballot in November to allow the parents and guardians of schoolchildren  —   citizen or non, documented or undocumented  —   to vote in school board elections, following a   vote by the board of supervisors on Tuesday. “San Francisco always goes against the grain when there are assaults on people’s liberties,” said supervisor Eric Mar, who sponsored the proposal.  “This is about fairness and equity, providing an opportunity for all parents to have a voice. ” This will be San Francisco voters’ third chance to approve such a measure, after unsuccessful efforts in 2004 and 2010  This year, advocates are hoping that voter distaste with the vehement   stance of the Republican party will help push the city’s notoriously liberal electorate over the edge.  “As Trumpist rhetoric continues to spew xenophobia, we have an obligation to stand up against that national tide and for inclusivity,” state assembly member David Chiu wrote in an   supporting the measure.  “I think in a year where we are seeing so much vitriol against our immigrant communities at the national level, particularly from our Republican nominee for president, it is more important than ever for San Francisco to stand up and say that we support our immigrant community,” said supervisor Jane Kim.  About   of San Francisco’s 60, 000 public school students have an immigrant parent or guardian, and the majority of them are not citizens. Mar estimates that there are a further 60, 000 private and parochial schoolchildren in the city, so the change could increase the number of voters in school board elections by tens of thousands.  San Francisco would join a small club of municipalities with   voting, including a handful of cities in Maryland, where   can vote in local elections, and Chicago, where   can vote in school council elections.  The idea of   voting may seem radical today, but it has a long history in the US. “Voting is not inevitably, naturally tied to citizenship,” said Ron Hayduk, a professor of political science at Queens College, CUNY.  Hayduk points out that many states allowed immigrants to vote until the early 20th century, and that, for much of US history, many citizens (including   owning men, women, and African Americans) were barred from doing so.  Despite that history, most Americans are opposed to immigrant voting, said Jack Citrin, professor of political science and director of Institute of Governmental Studies, UC Berkeley. “People expect immigrants to assimilate and fulfill basic civic obligations to get the right of citizenship,” he said. “It’s viewed as a hurdle that people should get over to have political rights. ” Still, when Citrin polled Californians on whether immigrants should be able to vote, serve on juries, or run for local offices in 2014, he found that people were persuadable.  “When we said, ‘These are people who pay local, state and federal taxes,’ it boosted support,” he noted. Sarah Song, a professor of law and political science at UC Berkeley, said that   voting could have positive effects on immigrant communities, including greater “participation and civic engagement in local politics” and a “greater sense of belonging and identification with the local community that immigrants have come to call home”. The lone voice of opposition on the San Francisco board of supervisors was Mark Farrell, who spoke of the importance of naturalization to his mother, an immigrant from Germany.  “I do wonder about a slippery slope,” he said. “If it’s school boards, why not supervisors? Why not anything else in this country?” Immigrants are not the only group that could gain a say in local elections in San Francisco. Voters in November will also have the chance to expand voting rights in local elections to   and   .

’Exceptionally rare’ Titanic locker key expected to fetch £50,000 at auction
A locker key from the Titanic is expected to be sold for up to £50, 000 at auction. The key was used by    Sidney Sedunary, from Shirley, Southampton, who was second   steward on the passenger liner and one of 1, 500 people who died when the vessel hit an iceberg in April 1912 in the north Atlantic.  His body was recovered, and his possessions, including his pocket watch and the “exceptionally rare” key, which held a brass tag with the words “Locker 14 F Deck” were sent to his pregnant wife, Madge.  Some of Sedunary’s belongings were donated to the Southampton Maritime Museum by his son, also named Sidney, but many remained with the family, including the key.  It will be sold on 22 October by the auctioneers Henry Aldridge  Son, of Devizes, Wiltshire, who are specialists in Titanic memorabilia. The firm’s consultant, Andrew Aldridge, said: “It is the first time it has ever been offered for auction. ”  He said that the significance of the key was linked to evidence given in May 1912 to the British inquiry into the liner’s sinking, by John Hart, a steward who had been on board. Aldridge said the evidence showed “Sedunary [was] heroically working on F Deck on the very night of the sinking, even though it was flooded. ” Sedunary’s son gave the key to a family member visiting from Australia in 1981.

I fear my 14-year-old son will kill me one day
Admitting that I’m scared of my son is almost impossible and no one knows all the details of our life behind closed doors. I’m small and very slight and Robbie is now nearly 6 feet tall and quite solid so he can inflict a lot of damage on me if my husband David isn’t there to stop it. The first time Robbie hurt me he was 11 and I’m still not convinced it was deliberate. We’d had a week of terrible weather and on the Sunday we decided to take the boys to a museum. We rarely do things as a family, as Robbie needs so much attention that his brother Joe ends up upset and frustrated, but we thought if we went early in the morning there wouldn’t be many people there. The first half hour was peaceful and David suggested he went to get coffees as we didn’t want to risk going to the cafe in case Robbie had a screaming fit. Two minutes later a big noisy family group came in and within seconds Robbie lost it, screaming and throwing himself on the floor. Joe turned his back and I tried to calm Robbie while the family gazed at us in horror. Robbie was thrashing around and I was trying to put my arms round him, a mix of consoling and restraining, and he punched me right on the nose. I could feel it crack and I literally saw stars, something I’d never thought was real. Tears were pouring from my eyes through sheer shock and I could feel my nose starting to bleed. One of the older men said something like “Young man stop this at once!” but that meant nothing to Robbie, who punched me in the head over and over. All these people gathered round us but obviously had no idea what to do and then David appeared and dropped both cups of coffee all over the floor as he rushed to grab Robbie. It was utter, humiliating pandemonium, with one of the men shouting at David that Robbie needed a good hard smack and David shouting back “You stupid bastard, he’s autistic!” All the way back to the car David held Robbie like a prisoner and Joe just said over and over, “I hate him. I wish he wasn’t my brother. ” It took us all weeks to recover. I had two black eyes and my nose and cheeks were bruised. Neither Joe nor David could look at me properly until my face was better. David was worried about me being in the house alone with Robbie when he came home from school but he has to work as I gave up my job to be at home with the boys. When Robbie was a toddler he was cute, with a solemn little face and curly blond hair. He was quite controllable at that point as I could remove him from any difficult situation easily. When Joe was born my sister helped a lot, as Robbie clearly hated the change to his routine with the arrival of the baby. When he was formally diagnosed I thought support would be put in place to help us all. I was really naive and assumed there would be help available as soon as I asked for it, but I now think something was only done because I turned up in such a state and they could see the damage he’d caused. I believe that they only worry that we might harm or kill him and have no concern that one day he might actually kill me. We now live in fear of that couple of days respite being withdrawn for any reason so I would never, ever rock the boat by asking for more, unless things got really desperate. There’s very little respite care available, even if you can afford to pay for it privately, which we can’t. I also know from people in the same situation that it’s impossible even to hope that Robbie will be able to move into some sort of   care. There’s no money and hardly any places. No one sees us as important. We were   at his diagnosis but each had a different reaction. David wanted to find out everything about the condition in the hope of a cure. I just wanted someone to tell me that with the right approach he could still have a lovely life. We came home and Joe was toddling round the living room, laughing at my sister tickling him and gleeful to see us. Robbie was tired and started banging his head off the wall and making the strange screeching noise that indicates he’s very distressed and might take hours to calm down. I burst into tears and David walked out of the room and slammed the door. Severe autism is difficult to understand if you don’t live with it. Everything we do is centred on Robbie’s condition, which is really hard on Joe. Our house is like a minimalist fortress with every window and door bolted, anything potentially dangerous shut away and even ornaments or pictures taken down now. The third time Robbie swept his hand across the mantelpiece and shattered everything on it I decided it wasn’t worth the bother. Robbie won’t sleep by himself and although David takes his turn at sleeping with him through the weekend, I’m completely shattered most of the time as Robbie wakes if I move at all. I can’t sleep properly and I wake constantly because I’m stiff and sore from lying in one position. The hitting started again six months ago, when he’d just turned 14. There had been a lot of tension with him at school and I’d been in and out for countless meetings. That’s frustrating because these people are meant to be professionals and trained to deal with children like him but it all came back to us and I felt judged because if his behaviour. I asked about respite care and was told quite sharply that it was unlikely because Robbie was loved and cared for, and not in any danger. Two days later he followed me around the house, coming up close to me, making a humming noise. He does this to David sometimes, or to strangers, and David hates it  —   he says he does it on purpose to irritate but I don’t actually think Robbie knows how to annoy someone deliberately  —   but he never normally does it to me. Then he beat me up. He punched me over and over in the face, coming after me when I tried to get away and constantly hitting me as I tried to defend myself. Then he just stopped, sat down on the couch and started leafing through a store catalogue. I was scared to move in case he started again and just lay huddled on the floor till David and Joe came in. My lip was so badly burst I needed stitches and again my face was a mess. That was the end of any sort of relationship between my sons. Joe hates Robbie and won’t listen to us trying to explain how frustrated he is at being unable to communicate and that is why he’s violent and also self harms. The tension in our house now is constant. David goes into work early as Robbie seems calmer in the mornings and goes to school all right, but after school is hard. David tries to get home with Joe just half an hour after Robbie is dropped off. I’m always on edge. If Robbie does hit me when I’m alone I curl up in a ball on the floor and try to protect my face, and if David’s in he physically stops him and shuts him into his bedroom. He lashes out at David but he’s taller and bigger than Robbie, so he can hold him back. Joe goes to afterschool care so he doesn’t get in the middle of any violence. So far we’ve managed to avoid Robbie attempting to hit his brother and Joe watches with complete disgust if Robbie starts  . He told me last week that he wishes Robbie would die, which broke my heart because I know Robbie only hurts me because he is in such pain himself. I went to the social work department with my battered face and begged for help which is why we now get the two nights of respite every six weeks. I couldn’t tell anyone else he was attacking me but then he tried to hit my sister so she can’t babysit anymore and David and I never go out as a couple, as we devote all our time to Joe during respite. I live from respite to respite and I never think about the future because that’s the only way I can cope with this life sentence. As told to Joan McFadden.  Names have been changed.

Coin given to US’s oldest park ranger by Barack Obama stolen in home invasion
The oldest park ranger in the US suffered a violent home invasion in which the suspect stole a commemorative coin Barack Obama gave to the    woman, according to California police. Park officials said on Thursday that the White House is sending a replacement coin to Betty Soskin, who works at the Rosie the   War II Home Front national historic park in northern California. But the ranger said she hopes she can recover the original. Around midnight on Monday, an intruder broke into Soskin’s bedroom in Richmond, just north of San Francisco, according to police. Authorities say the suspect, described as a “thin man in his 20s” punched Soskin multiple times when she tried to grab her phone, knocked her to the floor and dragged her into a hallway. Soskin told police that she managed to lock herself in the bathroom, and that when the intruder left, she found he had taken her iPad, cellphone, laptop, jewelry and the coin Obama had given her in December, which was one of her most prized possessions. “She’s doing alright, but emotionally obviously it’s a lot to deal with,” said Tom Leatherman, a National Park Service superintendent who spoke with Soskin after the assault. Soskin received national attention in December when she introduced Obama at a   ceremony in Washington DC. There, the president gave her the coin. “If I can get that coin back I think I can forgive anything,” Soskin told local news station KTVU on Wednesday. Soskin is   locally and within the park service for her talks and tours at the Rosie the Riveter park where she often tells personal stories about her life as a young black woman working at the Richmond shipyards during the second world war. Meeting the president and receiving the coin was a powerful experience for Soskin, Leatherman said. At the time, she brought with her a picture of her grandmother, who was born into slavery. “To watch the social changes that had to happen in order for that series of events to occur is something she reflects on on a regular basis,” he said, adding that within the park service, Soskin is seen as a “model of how we can use our own experiences to connect with people and provide some insights into the stories we’re telling”. In a 2015 interview with the Guardian, Soskin discussed her personal relationship to the park. “As a woman of color, my history with the park is a bit different. My experience was not as a Rosie the Riveter that tended to be a white woman’s story. Black women had been working outside their homes ever since slavery. ” She added: “I love showing visitors a film about the history of Richmond. When it ends, I get to do a commentary, bringing that history into the future. When the park was being set up, the exhibit designers and film makers really did listen to those of us who lived and worked here. I feel very much a part of its creation. ”

We all make mistakes: critics own up to their biggest gaffes
Arts journalism is a fairly   gig. Your newsroom colleagues will break stories, field lawsuits, protect their sources and occasionally risk their lives  —   and you will marvel at their bravery through the haze of a mild   hangover. Public humiliation is about as bad as it gets, as the New York Times’ TV critic Mike Hale found out last week. In a review of Amazon’s new legal drama Goliath, Hale criticised the show’s “split personality” “narrative juggling” and its “needlessly complicated structure”. He wrote: “Presumably because the first episode leaves so much unanswered, the next jumps back in time to fill in the history of the case  —   and when the second episode ends, the story hasn’t even caught up to where it started. ” On 18 October the Times issued a correction: Hale had watched the first two episodes in the wrong order. We’ve all been there. To prove it, Guardian Australia’s arts writers offer their worst mistakes. Prepare to cringe. Crime against criticism: Got it wrong, badly. It’s 2004, I’ve just finished my undergraduate degree with a scriptwriting major, and I am convinced I know everything. I’m employed as a reader for an actor agency it’s my job to read and assess scripts and hand a report to the agent, who then decides if the project is worth considering for their talent.  After writing these reports for months I’m at the point where I am totally cocky about it, and I get given this script for a horror film that the agency says there’s a “lot of heat” about.  And I read it and I hate it. Nothing seems to happen for the first 40 pages, then there’s this orgy of gratuitous violence towards women that just infuriates me. I write the report to end all reports, excoriating this script in  —   ahem  —     terms. The movie is so appalling, I insist, it will destroy forever the career of any actor who appears in it.  I learned later that the report was so brutal it was passed around quite a broad circle of agents and industry types. Our agency passed on the project and none of our actors were cast. The movie was Wolf Creek, and it turned out to be the most commercially successful Australian movie in years. The part of the villain went to John Jarratt, who got on the Hollywood radar and ended up working with Tarantino. I never worked as a script reader again. Crime against criticism: Didn’t swap names. Last year I was due to interview a member of Death Cab for Cutie at a music festival. The instruction from the PR was to meet at a picnic table in the outdoor backstage area in the early evening. I sat down and was eventually joined by a man who initiated conversation without introducing himself. Only about 90 seconds into our “interview”  —   when he noticed I was recording our chat  —   did it become apparent he was in fact a label guy. I think it made his night but he did promise not to tell anyone. Crime against criticism: Did swap names. I somehow confused the artist Charles Blackman with John Blackman, the voice over guy from Hey Hey It’s Saturday. The piece sailed through subbing and into print, where Charles was referred to as John throughout. A friend of mine used to brutally remind me of that   for many years, until she did a gig as a guest editor of an issue of an art magazine, which had the cover line “Artists of the 21st Millennium”.  Thankfully she’s never mentioned the   thing again.  Crime against criticism: Missing humility. I’m sure I’ve made a few howlers in my time writing about music, but what really sticks with me is the time I bumped into the  ’ Grant McLennan in a record store just a few weeks before he died.  We were chatting as we flipped through the racks of CDs and he pulled out a copy of PJ Harvey’s Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea and went on a passionate rave about it. I demurred I was a big fan of her early work and wasn’t so enamoured with this new, glossy version of Polly.  Grant asked me what I didn’t like about it and I said something like I didn’t think her songwriting was on the same level as her earlier work. Grant had a lazy eye which veered disconcertingly off to one side, but at that moment I caught him looking right through me. “Really?” he said.  He had a little lopsided grin on his face and at that moment I realised the absurdity of my position, dissing one of the great songwriters of the age to another  —   and never having written a song in my life. I have a Matt Groening Life in Hell strip stuck to my fridge called “How to be a Feisty Rock Critic” which serves as a constant reminder that my career choice is vaguely ridiculous, and I have never felt more ridiculous than I did in that moment. I learned a lot about humility that day.  Crime against criticism: Missing recording. I was the editor of pop culture title TheVine when the opportunity for a    interview with PJ Harvey popped up. A lifelong fan, I jumped at the chance.  On the allotted day I headed down to the theatre where she was performing that night, and was led through a labyrinth of passageways to a tiny dressing room. I sat down, placed my voice recorder and notebook on a bench, and waited for Polly while wrestling with my nerves. Finally, she arrived alone, quietly said hello, closed the door behind her, and sat down opposite me,    waiting for my questions.  Knowing she doesn’t suffer fools, I was determined to not waste her time. Polly’s eyes are big  —   alien, almost  —   and as we held eye contact and chatted about the intense themes of her new record for 45 minutes, it was all I could do to not congratulate myself for conducting such a great,    chat straight off the top of my head. So much so that afterwards, as I wandered blinking out into the sunshine, it was with great horror I discovered I hadn’t recorded a single word of it. I’d been so intent on having a natural conversation with one of my idols I hadn’t actually pressed record. Like a journalist would. Crime against criticism: Faked it, badly. I cut my teeth on music blogs, writing terrible album reviews packed with empty platitudes, phrases I didn’t understand (“the rhythm section is undeniable, but far too high in the mix”) and generic, gendered words like “chanteuse”. After a few years I was ready to cover my first live show. Haha, just kidding, no I wasn’t.  It was the EP launch of a beloved Sydney band at a beloved Sydney pub, so I pretended to be deeply familiar with both. I referred to the guitarist by the nickname I was pretty sure his friends used, and described the venue as if I’d been there dozens of times.  “The lead singer is making lots of eye contact with the drummer, which makes for a very cohesive sound,” I wrote, exhibiting exactly zero understanding of how music works. I thought the band sounded just fine (probably all that eye contact!) but there was one problem I couldn’t get over: before they came on, the curtain had been lowered over the stage to “build hype” and a “pretentious aura of importance that this rough and ready band don’t deserve”. The worst part? They made us wait for their performance.  The day after it was published, I read the comments and learned four things: the curtain drop was apparently a venue tradition it takes time for bands to swap backlines the guitarist with the nickname hadn’t played that night and I was an idiot. Crime against criticism: Backstreet’s back, oh no. Somehow, dazzled by the genuine magnificence of the Backstreet Boys’ downbeat comeback single Incomplete (the music video for which featured the Boys walking away from a variety of   experiences brilliant!) I decided that the   accompanying album was worthy of a     star review  —   Christ, it might actually have been five.  The review is, mercifully, not online, and my copy now exists only in some   hard drive, which means the memory of my misplaced enthusiasm has taken on the nebulous form of a fever dream: “Did I really say that? In print?” I have always been prepared to go in to bat for pop music, particularly when other critics consider it chintzy or not worthy of genuine critical examination  —   but, come on,   .

Pentagon revises its rules to clarify protections for journalists
The Pentagon has revised its Law of War guidelines to remove wording that could permit US military commanders to treat war correspondents as “unprivileged belligerents” if they think the journalists are sympathizing or cooperating with enemy forces. The amended manual, published on Friday, also drops wording that equated journalism with spying. These and other changes were made in response to complaints by news organizations, including the Associated Press, which expressed concern to defense department lawyers and other officials that updates to the manual published last summer contained vaguely worded provisions that commanders could interpret as allowing them to detain journalists for any number of perceived offenses. “The manual was restructured to make it more clear and up front that journalists are civilians and are to be protected as such,” Charles A Allen, the Pentagon’s deputy general counsel, said in a conference call with reporters on Thursday. The revised manual more explicitly states that engaging in journalism does not constitute taking a direct part in hostilities. “Where possible, efforts should be made to distinguish between the activities of journalists and the activities of enemy forces, so that journalists’ activities [such as] meetings or other contacts with enemy personnel for journalistic purposes do not result in a mistaken conclusion that a journalist is part of enemy forces,” the revised manual says. Jennifer O’Connor, the Pentagon’s top lawyer, said in a statement that consultations with news organizations over the past year “helped us improve the manual and communicate more clearly the department’s support for the protection of journalists under the law of war”. “It is always a challenge for journalists to work in war zones, but it is particularly tricky when embedding with military forces because the missions are different,” said Kathleen Carroll, executive editor of the AP. “It is important that the Law of War manual recognize that the roles of each are different  —   each important but distinctly different. ” The manual’s earlier version, published in 2015, said that while journalists “in general” are civilians, they “may be members of the armed forces, persons authorized to accompany the armed forces, or unprivileged belligerents”. In the view of experts in military law and journalism, that wording could be interpreted as allowing commanders to detain journalists for perceived offenses. A person deemed to be an “unprivileged belligerent” is not entitled to the rights afforded by the Geneva Conventions, so a commander could restrict such a reporter from certain coverage areas or even hold the reporter indefinitely without charges. Pentagon officials had said the 2015 manual’s reference to “unprivileged belligerents” was intended to point out that terrorists or spies could be masquerading as reporters. The revised version makes this explicit by citing the example of “  armed groups” of which   would be an example, that use members for propaganda or other media activities, such as those who work for  ’s Inspire magazine to encourage or recruit militants to join their cause. The new manual also says journalists should not take action “adversely affecting their status as civilians” if they want to retain protection as a civilian. “For example, relaying target coordinates with the specific purpose of directing an artillery strike against opposing forces would constitute taking a direct part in hostilities,” it says, and in such a case the person would forfeit protection.

Syrian civilians killed in apparent revenge bombing for pilot death
At least 30 civilians have died in Syrian airstrikes on a town   of Damascus a day after rebels reportedly killed an air force pilot, a monitoring group and rebels said.  According to their reports, the raids targeted a medical centre, a school and a residential area in Jayrud, a heavily populated area that struck a truce with the army that had spared it from heavy bombing on other   areas. As a result it had become a sanctuary for thousands of civilians fleeing battles nearby.  The   Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said scores of residents were also injured in the aerial strikes on Saturday, as well as shelling from army posts in the area.  A rebel spokesman said the strikes seemed to be in revenge for the killing of the pilot, who parachuted down near the town after his plane crashed on Friday.  “The strikes against civilians are in retaliation against the execution of the pilot by Nusra Front,” said Said Seif   from the Free Syrian Army’s (FSA) Shahid Ahmad Abdo brigade that operates in Jayrud alongside  ’s Nusra Front and other groups.  Rebels in a joint operations room targeted a main army base in the region with      missiles after the aerial strikes, Qalamoni said.  Syrian state media said Friday’s plane crash was due to a technical fault and the pilot had ejected, while the rebel group Jaysh   said it had shot down the plane, but did not say how.  The group said the pilot was arrested and subsequently killed by a fighter from the Nusra Front while being held at a joint command centre.  The army had warned of a strong response after the killing was reported shortly after he was shown on a rebel video circulated on social media giving details of his mission.  Meanwhile, Russian and Syrian planes intensified their bombing on Saturday of a strategic   area of Aleppo that is near the only route into   parts of the northern city. If the Malah area fell to the army and its allies they would succeed in laying siege to areas where more than 400, 000 people live under rebel control.

Garry Marshall, creator of Happy Days, dies aged 81
Garry Marshall, the writer, director and producer who created the hit 1970s series Happy Days and directed Pretty Woman, has died aged 81. Michelle Bega, his publicist, said he died on Tuesday at a hospital in Burbank in Los Angeles of complications from pneumonia after having a stroke. Marshall’s career began in the 1960s when he worked as a writer on the Dick Van Dyke Show. In 1971 he wrote the pilot for Happy Days, which went on to debut as a series in 1974, and became America’s most popular TV show in 1976. The series ran from 1974 to 1984.  He is credited with originating the phrase “jumping the shark” which entered the lexicon following a   episode of the sitcom Happy Days when the character Fonzie jumps over a shark while on waterskis. Speaking to the Guardian Henry Winkler, who played the Fonz, described Marshall as “a don”. “He gave me an introduction to the world through Happy Days,” he said. “I kissed his ring. He had a generosity of spirit that was so full and bright it hardly fit on on this planet”. Marshall, who was born in the Bronx, also created other popular 70s shows such as Mork and Mindy and Laverne and Shirley. He spent the 1980s and 1990s directing films, including the blockbuster Pretty Woman, with Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, which took $463m worldwide. More recently he worked on The Princess Diaries and Runaway Bride. Former colleagues were swift to pay tribute to him on social media. Marshall also had an   presence, using his New York accent and gruff delivery in colourful supporting roles in movies that included Lost in America and Soapdish. Marshall, brother of   Penny Marshall, earned a degree in journalism from Northwestern University and worked at the New York Daily News. But he found he was better at writing punchlines. He began his entertainment career in the 1960s selling jokes to comedians, then moved to writing sketches for The Tonight Show with Jack Paar in New York. “In the neighborhood where we grew up in, the Bronx, you only had a few choices,” Marshall said in a 1980s interview. “You were either an athlete or a gangster, or you were funny. ” In his 1995 autobiography, he said: “I believe that television was, and still is, the only medium that can truly reach society’s lowest common denominator and entertain those people who maybe can’t afford a movie or a play. So why not reach them and do it well?” he said. Marshall and his wife, Barbara, had three children, Lori, Kathleen and Scott. Funeral services would be private, but a memorial was being planned for his birthday on 13 November. Associated Press contributed to this report

Judge in Stanford sexual assault trial launches campaign to fight recall effort
The judge in the Stanford sexual assault case has launched a campaign to fight the   effort to unseat him, declaring that he has a “reputation for being fair to both sides” in his first public comments on the controversy. Judge Aaron Persky, who received widespread backlash for his sentencing of former Stanford swimmer Brock Turner, is campaigning to stay in office and has launched the website RetainJudgePersky. com where he states that he is a strong advocate for “judicial independence”.  “I took an oath to uphold the Constitution, not to appease politicians or ideologues. When your own rights and property are at stake, you want the judge to make a fair and lawful decision, free from political influence,” he wrote on the site. The northern California judge’s statements mark the first time he has directly addressed the   initiative to recall him from office over his light sentencing of Turner, who was convicted of multiple felony counts of sexual assault. Persky is also soliciting donations on the site. Persky sentenced the    athlete to six months in county jail, which is lighter than the minimum of two years in state prison prescribed by law. Turner was caught sexually assaulting an unconscious woman by a dumpster outside an   fraternity party, but throughout the trial, he argued that the encounter was consensual.  Turner, who went to jail in June, is scheduled to be released on Friday after serving only half of his sentence. In California, inmates with good behavior are often released early. The case made headlines across the globe after the victim released a powerful impact statement detailing the trauma of the trial. Michele Landis Dauber, a Stanford law professor and family friend of the victim, subsequently organized a formal initiative to remove Persky from office, arguing that the Santa Clara County judge failed to treat assault as a serious crime. Prosecutors later removed Persky from a new sexual assault case, saying they lacked confidence in him. Last week, the judge took the unusual step of removing himself from all criminal cases and transferring to civil court, but Dauber said the recall campaign would continue. The judge’s opponents have argued that he has repeatedly been too lenient towards men convicted of sex crimes and violence against women, including when he presided over a sexual assault case in civil court. But Persky’s supporters, including public defenders, former judges and law school professors, have argued that the recall is misguided and that judges should not be removed from office for a single decision. His defenders further fear that the push for harsher sentencing could lead to more severe punishments for   defendants and people of color disproportionately caught up in the criminal justice system. On Monday, lawmakers approved legislation inspired by the Turner trial that seeks to make prison a mandatory punishment in cases of sexual assault involving unconscious victims. On his website, Persky notes that he has served in public office for nearly 20 years, first as a criminal prosecutor. “I prosecuted hate crimes and sexually violent predators,” he said. “As a judge, I have heard thousands of cases. I have a reputation for being fair to both sides. ” Persky, who has served as a judge for the past 12 years, noted that he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Stanford and that he is married with two children. The site also features links about judicial independence, including one letter from retired judges defending Persky, which says judges may be recalled for illegal or unethical conduct, but that “the essence of judicial independence is that judges must be able to make decisions without fear of political repercussions”. Dauber said on Tuesday said Persky’s pattern of unjust sentencing warranted the recall. “Judicial independence is really important   …     but in order to be exercised freely and appropriately, it has to be exercised without bias. ” Persky has raised $3, 600 in contributions for his campaign, according to the Mercury News. Dauber said the recall campaign has raised more than $250, 000 in pledged funds and cash.

Donald Trump the clear winner in New Hampshire debate featuring only himself
Donald Trump prepared for Sunday’s town   debate with Hillary Clinton by insisting he wasn’t preparing for it. At a town hall in Sandown, New Hampshire, questions were written down by an invited audience and then read by moderator Howie Carr, a   talk show host in New England. There was even a timer that kept Trump from talking for more than two minutes at a time. But the Republican nominee insisting he wasn’t preparing for his next bout with Hillary Clinton. “This has nothing to do with Sunday,” Trump insisted.  He even complained about the media hype around his debate preparations. “Even tonight they said ‘Donald Trump is going to New Hampshire to practice for Sunday’   …     it’s like they make you into a child. “You really think Hillary Clinton is debate prepping for three or four days? She is resting   …     she wants to build up her energy for Sunday night and that’s fine. ” The town hall was the only public event staged by either presidential candidate on Thursday. Clinton held a private fundraiser at the St Regis Hotel in New York but otherwise did not appear on the campaign trail.  Trump’s performance in the first presidential debate was widely considered disastrous and Clinton has risen steadily in polling numbers to build a solid lead. On Thursday, Real Clear Politics showed the former secretary of state with an advantage of just over four percentage points. Sunday’s debate at Washington University in St Louis represents a critical opportunity for Trump to try and turn the tide. He was neck and neck in the polls with Clinton prior to the first debate.  In Sandown, Trump looked back on that contest. First he blamed the microphone, but later told a questioner: “I did hold back. ”  Still, he wouldn’t attack Clinton’s personal life on Sunday. “I’d much rather it be on policy. I didn’t like it getting into the gutter. ” The spectre of Hurricane Matthew hung over both campaigns on Thursday as the storm menaced Florida’s Atlantic coast. The Clinton campaign has asked cable companies in Florida not to run its advertisements on the Weather Channel this week after Republican complaints of opportunism. The Trump campaign in a statement on Thursday offered “our thoughts and prayers” to everyone in the path of Hurricane Matthew and called on residents of affected areas to heed warnings and evacuation orders. Trump went on to express condolences to Haiti. “The United States should offer our assistance to help our island neighbors,” he said. Before Sunday’s debate Trump is scheduled to appear in southern Wisconsin at an event held by the local Republican party in the district of Speaker Paul Ryan. It will mark the first time Ryan has appeared on the campaign trail with his party’s nominee. Trump will be joined by the state’s governor, Scott Walker, as well as Senator Ron Johnson, who is facing a tough fight to hold his seat in the Badger State. Clinton is not scheduled to hold any public events before Sunday. However   surrogates like Bill Clinton and Bernie Sanders are scheduled to appear on her behalf in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania respectively.

Nebraska politicians can’t agree on the death penalty – now voters get to decide
When Nebraska last year became the first conservative state to repeal the death penalty in more than 40 years, change came through a vote that saw ideological opponents of capital punishment unite with pragmatists worried about cost and effectiveness. But it was not an outcome that the state’s governor, Pete Ricketts, was ready to accept. In a contentious    Ricketts vetoed a bill passed by the state legislature before the lawmakers overrode him by a 30 to 19 vote. Within a few weeks, death penalty supporters gathered enough signatures to introduce a ballot measure. Ricketts is bankrolling that effort, to the tune of $300, 000. This bid to bring back capital punishment again will go to a public vote on 8 November, as both sides escalate their spending and their rhetoric in an ideological battle over the penalty, even though the sparsely populated state of less than 2 million people rarely carries it out.  “I think a lot of people, that rubbed them the wrong way  —   but you know, that’s the democratic process and now the voters get to decide,” Dan Parsons, a spokesman for the   penalty group Retain a Just Nebraska, said of the governor’s contributions. Retain a Just Nebraska, which Parsons says has raised $2. 7m, began airing a television commercial this week featuring Ada JoAnn Taylor, one of the Beatrice Six. Taylor spent more than 19 years in prison as one of six people wrongly convicted of the rape and murder of a    woman in Beatrice, Nebraska, in 1985. “After my arrest I was threatened with the death penalty and told I’d be the first woman on death row in Nebraska nearly every day that I was in the Gage County jail until I agreed to plead guilty,” she told a press conference on Tuesday.  She was taken away from her    son and had to give him up for adoption. They did not meet again for 26 years. Taylor said that anxiety about possibly being executed caused her to become delusional: “The threat of the death penalty was terrifying and overwhelming, I came to believe I must have been guilty. ” The governor has countered in a newspaper column that “checks and balances in Nebraska ensure that the death penalty is used sparingly and applied justly, and rapid advancements in DNA technology will help to ensure accuracy in future cases. ”  Ricketts’ father, Joe, has also given $100, 000 to Nebraskans for the Death Penalty, the Omaha   reported. The group did not respond to requests for comment. Joe Ricketts is a billionaire who founded the online broker TD Ameritrade. The Ricketts family owns the Chicago Cubs baseball team. “This is an internal political fight between Governor Ricketts and the legislature,” said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. “He has staked his political prestige on overturning the repeal of the death penalty. ”  Voters in California and Oklahoma will also decide death penalty questions on 8 November. Confusingly, the ballot language in Nebraska means that selecting “retain” will abolish capital punishment and “repeal” will keep it, raising the possibility that some votes will be cast erroneously. Nebraska has executed three people since capital punishment was reinstated nationwide in 1976 and none since 1997, when Robert Williams, convicted of multiple murders, died in the electric chair. Its death row consists of 10 people. Across the country, 17 people have been executed this year in five states, but the punishment is in decline  —   the US is on track for the fewest judicial killings in a year since 1991. Parsons cited a disputed study by a Creighton University economist, which claims that Nebraska’s death penalty costs on average an extra $14. 6m annually compared with life without parole. “Fiscal conservatives  —   whether you’re Republican or Democrat  —   I think most people in Nebraska don’t like wasting tax dollars,” he said. Colby Coash, a Republican state senator, was one of the conservatives who voted for the repeal, calling the practice unjust. In a speech last year he said his stance was informed by seeing the suffering of the sister of a murder victim who waited in vain for 30 years for her brother’s killer to be executed. In the end, the death row inmate died of cancer.  Coash also recalled feeling uneasy when, as a college student in Lincoln in 1994, he went to the state penitentiary for a   execution. People gathered outside to celebrate in what he described as a   atmosphere, with a band playing, people drinking beer and grilling food and a New Year’s   clock counting down the minutes until midnight. “You wouldn’t have been able to tell the difference between what I was participating in at 11 o’clock at night and what you might see an hour before a [college] football game,” he told the audience. “At midnight, everybody cheered . .. and fireworks shot off. ” A report in the New York Times put the crowd at about 2, 000. Harold Otey was executed in the same electric chair used in Nebraska’s previous execution, 35 years earlier. “Mr Otey made no final statement, but mouthed ‘I love you,’ to his three chosen witnesses after he was strapped into the chair,” the report said. “Sweat poured off his head and soaked his shirt. Minutes later, four   jolts of electricity coursed through his body. After the third jolt, smoke rose from his left leg. ” Even if voters decide in favor of the punishment, other hurdles pose considerable challenges to future executions in the state. Now committed to the lethal injection method, it is far from clear that the state would even be able to source suitable drugs. As BuzzFeed reported, last year Nebraska spent $26, 700 on a feckless attempt to import drugs from a dubious source in India. The shipment never left the country because the drugs were likely illegal to import into the US and would have been seized by federal authorities. “Even if the voters restore the death penalty, there’s no guarantee that the statute is even constitutional” in the light of a US supreme court decision in January on the role of juries in sentencing in Florida, Dunham said. “There’s a very significant prospect that Nebraska’s death penalty statute would be declared unconstitutional because the ultimate sentencing decision there, the weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, is made by a   panel” rather than a jury, he said.

Pokémon Go is just the start – Silicon Valley is taking over our reality
From minefields in Bosnia to military bases in Indonesia, from Holocaust museums to Julian Assange’s embassy, Pokémon seem to be everywhere. As Pokémon Go takes over the world, Saudi clerics have renewed a fatwa against the gaming series and Japan’s authorities have released safety guidelines in preparation for the official launch there. Never before has digital reality become so integrated into our physical world. It has even become part of the US presidential elections, with Hillary Clinton chiming in that she doesn’t “know who created Pokémon Go, but I’d try to figure out how to get them to have Pokémon go to the polls”. In truth Clinton knows very well who created Pokémon Go. It was her friends in Silicon Valley. How to explain the success of Pokémon Go? One way is to follow the money, and it might be easier to explain. Augmented reality (AR) is not something new it has been used for years in the military and for navigation systems. What makes Pokémon Go novel is that AR has gone mainstream for the first time. And it has to be understood as a historical break, which will profoundly change the way we perceive and experience reality. It will change reality itself. AR is in a way even more interesting than virtual reality (VR) as it doesn’t replace the real world with a simulated one, but is rather a sophisticated combination of both. AR integrates the digital into the real (by using your smartphone camera to transfer the digital Pokémon into the physical world) and the real into the digital (your physical body becomes part of a simulated reality). Pokémon Go was created by Niantic, whose director John Hanke was one of the founders of Keyhole  —   a pioneering software development company specialised in geospatial data visualisation that paved the way for Google Maps and Google Earth. Keyhole was acquired by Google in 2004, as was Niantic. Pokémon Go wouldn’t be possible without Google. After Google Glass received massive criticism and legislative action due to privacy and safety concerns, it can even be seen as a first successful commercial step in the direction of enabling Google’s AR dream. And this is why the   of what Hillary Clinton says about this is important. She must know that it is the former CEO of Google, Eric Schmidt, who is running the digital component of her own campaign, using a startup known as The Groundwork. And she must know that Schmidt recently became head of the Pentagon’s innovation board and that between January 2009 and October 2015, Google’s top executives and representatives gathered at the White House on 427 separate occasions. Obviously there is a symbiotic relationship between the US state department and Silicon Valley. But why should this worry us? We don’t have to speculate about what Silicon Valley’s ideology is, it is enough to read Peter Thiel’s Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future. Thiel, part of the   “Paypal mafia” and owner of Palantir, explicitly says that “competition is a relic of history” and that monopoly capitalism is not a pathology or an exception, but the condition of every successful business. Google is one of the best examples: almost all of Google’s “innovations” are a product of acquisition (from Google Maps to Youtube). Another successful example, mentioned by Thiel himself, is Tesla Motors: “Tesla’s technology is so good that other car companies rely on it: Daimler uses Tesla’s battery packs Mercedes Benz uses a Tesla powertrain Toyota uses a Tesla motor. General Motors has even created a taskforce to track Tesla’s next moves. But Tesla’s greatest technological achievement isn’t one single component, but rather its ability to integrate many components into one superior product. ” This is the best description of monopoly capitalism. The success of Silicon Valley is not a result of genius, but purchase  —   Google, Facebook, Apple or Palantir succeeded in creating such powerful and pervasive monopolies precisely because of such acquisitions. Pokémon Go marks a further step, because the penetration of Silicon Valley into the most intimate aspects of our lives through social networks and new technology has reached a level in which our physical reality becomes integrated into the digital reality. Soon it will be impossible to distinguish the physical from the digital, realising the idea behind Google Glass. Pokémon Go should be viewed as an important breakthrough that can’t be defined properly without taking into consideration the total colonisation undertaken by Silicon Valley through the “internet of things” (absolute integration of our vehicles, homes, tools into the network) “smart cities” (acquisition of our cities’ infrastructure by Silicon Valley) social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) Google, transport innovations (drones, Tesla Motors, etc) “big data” total surveillance, AI, VR, and last but not least, immortality (Silicon Valley’s dream that we will upload our brains and live forever). All these fields of massive investment and radical innovation transform our reality in such a profound way that every aspect of our lives will soon be integrated into a big global digital “network” which is already, for the first time in human history, enabling the creation of a constantly interconnected global brain. The problem is not technology or innovation, the problem is monopoly capitalism: the fact that all this power is concentrated in a few companies from Silicon Valley, who openly want to create a brave new world in which technology only serves profit. While we’re all busy playing Pokémon, the companies are following the game’s advice  —   “Gotta catch ‘em all”. Only, its us being captured in an inescapable web of technological consumerism.

Facing my fear: did I have the cancer mutation that killed my dad?
I’ve known for years that my paternal grandmother died of colon cancer in her early 40s. But I didn’t think it had too much to do with me, beyond being a very sad fact in our family history and inspiring a lot of intense  —   and embarrassing  —   conversations about how much fiber we were eating. It wasn’t until nearly 50 years after her death that my family learned that the cause of my grandmother’s cancer was Lynch syndrome, a genetic condition that carries not just a high risk of colon cancer, but endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer and skin cancer. Others, as well. We learned about my grandmother’s Lynch syndrome when my father was diagnosed with it six years ago: he had a skin cancer that was typical of Lynch. He had other risk factors, too: he fit the Amsterdam Criteria, which were developed by doctors in 1990 to help to identify families with Lynch. My grandmother died four years before the syndrome was identified at all.  When my dad called me on Skype to tell me the news, he was in Baltimore, and I was living in London. “You should get tested for this,” he said. I said OK, but I didn’t do it. I was afraid. My two siblings, an older brother and a younger sister, quickly took the test. With Lynch syndrome you have a 50% chance of carrying the gene if one of your parents does. Neither of my siblings had it. When I think about the many reasons that I didn’t get tested, I have to admit that among them was the fact that I didn’t believe that our family could be so lucky that all three of us had escaped, even though I believe in science over luck.  I blamed administrative issues when my family asked me why I hadn’t had the test. Lynch is rare enough that I assumed it wouldn’t be straightforward to arrange for the testing on Britain’s National Health Service (that said, I never tried).   there was a possibility that testing positive would affect my ability to get health insurance when I moved back to the US.   I moved to Berlin, where I had one unsuccessful phone call with a genetics institute  —   I didn’t know how to say ‘colon cancer’ auf Deutsch. Too difficult, I concluded. Another reason that I didn’t get the test  —   a simple blood draw  —   is that I was single. Prophylactic hysterectomy is the recommended treatment for women with Lynch syndrome because of the high risk of gynecological cancers. They’re hard to catch early and difficult to treat. Being unpartnered in my early thirties hadn’t troubled me too much: I was happy to wait for the right person. But now on first dates I’d look across the rim of my pinot grigio at some man who was mostly a stranger and wonder, “Am I going to have to tell you about the likelihood of my early surgical menopause?” In the spring of 2012, my father, who never smoked a thing, was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer. The tumor carried the markers of Lynch syndrome  —   unusual, but not unheard of. On one of my last visits home, we went to Staples together. By then it was painful for him to walk, and he looked lost in the folds of a coat he’d worn every winter for a decade.  Before getting out of the car we sat for a moment. “You should get tested,” he said, and I stared hard through the windscreen at the big grey parking lot and said: “Yes, Dad, I know. ” But I didn’t intend to do it as long as he was alive. I was scared I’d have to tell my father that I carried the same gene that had caused the cancer that was killing him. After he died at the beginning of 2014, six weeks after I moved back to the US to be near him and my mother, it felt like the biggest reason I had been avoiding the test was gone. Losing my dad was the worst thing that had ever happened to me, and I’d survived. Getting tested, I decided, could not be worse. Lynch syndrome is bad, but it doesn’t have to be fatal: my mother pointed out that my   had it and died in her   from something else altogether. And getting tested was what my dad wanted me to do. I gave up a vial of blood and went on vacation while I waited to hear I felt a kind of relief that I’d finally taken responsibility for my health. This was followed by a feeling of crippling regret. After I got the news, I felt for a time an intense and bleak terror about my future that was far worse than the fear I’d had of taking the test. But in time, I started to feel better. I’d lived with the gene since the day I was born. Now I knew that if I took precautions, my life expectancy would be normal. I’m fortunate to have access to doctors who are enthusiastic about the project of monitoring my health: nothing is perfect, but there are many tests I can take to help identify cancer in its earliest stages.  Surgery is in my future, but several years away. I can’t tell anyone else who is facing the decision to be tested for susceptibility to a disease what the right choice is for them. I can only say that I’m glad that I did it.

Ten years on from the West Wing finale, the show’s shadow still looms large
It’s strange to think that 10 years ago today The West Wing, one of the most legendary and highly praised shows in recent memory, aired its final episode. That oddness isn’t because it makes us all feel old or because we’ve slipped into some crazy wormhole where time speeds up, but because The West Wing is possibly the first show to never entirely go away. The show debuted in September 1999, when there was still a Democratic president in office and the dotcom bubble had yet to burst. It’s crazy to think that the show that defined politics for many people in the 2000s actually straddled the   events of September 11. But even more important to The West Wing’s legacy is how technology changed over that time. Plenty of people jumped on the West Wing bandwagon after it won its first Emmy, surging the audience from about 9 million viewers to its peak of 17 million. That jump was aided in part by DVD sets for TV shows, which were just coming into vogue and definitely aren’t now. Since the show ended, it’s become a fixture on streaming services and all seven seasons are currently available on Netflix, so viewers can either rewatch CJ Cregg doing The Jackal as many times as they’d like or experience the show for the first time. Catching up on the show became so popular that Joshua Molina, who played Will Bailey on seasons four through seven, started a podcast called West Wing Weekly, where he works through the show’s 156 episodes.  Thanks to Netflix, shows such as The West Wing and Friends are stuck in this strange nostalgia feedback loop, with old fans wanting to revisit a certain time and novices wishing they were in that time even though they missed it the first time around. This is especially odd for The West Wing, which was embroiled in current events when it aired but also presenting the sort of government that many viewers wish we had when it was airing in the depths of the Bush administration. Jed Bartlet and his acolytes were always more progressive, more intelligent and much more fair than what Democrats at the time were experiencing in real life. Thanks to creator Aaron Sorkin, it was government as liberal fantasy, one where our politicians could hold positions that were untenable in real life.  The world eventually caught up to The West Wing, and the show presaged many of the changes that we would see in just a few years time. Bartlet appointed the supreme court’s first Latino justice in 1999, something that Barack Obama did nine years later when he appointed Sonia Sotomayor. The show’s first season included a storyline about repealing “don’t ask, don’t tell” in 1999, which took 11 years for Obama to repeal. Osama bin Laden was even a suspect in President Bartlet’s shooting two years before he would claim responsibility for  .  There have been a host of other ongoing political issues that we first heard about on The West Wing: government shutdowns, the rise of filibusters, journalists being kidnapped, and the constant debate over the debt ceiling. However, there is nothing more prescient than the show’s final season where Matthew Santos, the country’s first president of color, assumes office. The character should remind viewers of Obama because he was actually based on the then   senator from Illinois.  That’s why The West Wing has really never gone away, because it is as much about the world we live in now as it is about the world as it was then. In fact, it might be even more relevant today than it was 10 years ago.  And still, as our political system continues to degrade  —   there’s gridlock in Congress over so many issues, and both parties are resorting to filibusters even to get the most basic legislation passed  —   The West Wing shows us a world where the political system works. It reminds us of a time, not too long ago, when people in political office took their jobs very seriously and wanted to actually govern this country rather than settle scores and appeal to their respective bases. The most popular political dramas of our day are Scandal and House of Cards, ones where   plotting and murderous presidents take center stage rather than the ideals of governing.  We’re about to enter into an election where both candidates have historically low favorable ratings. It’s no wonder why people want to escape with President Bartlet, who never did any wrong and was as noble a creature who ever entered politics. Thanks to technology, we can, but because of a ruptured political process, we really need to.

Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg aim to ’cure, prevent and manage’ all disease
Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have laid out plans to invest $3bn over the next 10 years with the not insignificant goal of tackling all diseases. “Can we cure, prevent or manage all disease by the end of this century?” asked Zuckerberg, speaking in front of a packed lecture theater at the University of California, San Francisco’s (UCSF) William J Rutter Center. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative will focus on some of the world’s biggest killers, including heart disease, cancer, infectious diseases and neurological diseases.  One of its biggest investments is to be a $600m “Biohub” at UCSF, which will bring together scientists and engineers from Stanford, Berkeley and UCSF  —   who haven’t collaborated in this way before  —   to develop tools to treat diseases.  The second focus will be transformative technology, all of which will be made available to all scientists everywhere.  “Throughout the history of science, most of the major scientific breakthroughs have been preceded by some new tool and technology that allows you to see in new ways,” explained Zuckerberg. “The telescope helped us understand astronomy and the universe, the microscope helped us understand cells and bacteria to help us develop treatments for infectious diseases, while DNA sequencing and editing helps us fight cancer and genetic disorders. ” Zuckerberg suggested that artificial intelligence could help with brain imaging to treat neurological diseases, machine learning could be used to analyse cancer genomes, and chips and blood monitors could identify diseases quickly. “These are the kinds of tools we want to focus on building at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,” he said.  The acclaimed American neurobiologist Cornelia Bargmann, who will lead the initiative, gave the example of a “cell atlas” a comprehensive resource that maps the locations, types and molecular properties of all of the cells in the human body.  “We need this to develop new understanding and cures for diseases in all areas of medicine,” she said.  The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is a limited liability company that the couple uses to make donations and investments to advance their philanthropic causes. It was launched at the birth of the couple’s first daughter, Max, in December 2015. The couple has committed 99% of their Facebook stock, valued at $45bn, to the initiative, which makes charitable donations and   investments. The organisation initially focused on education, funding the Indian company BYJU’s, which helps students learn maths and science, and the Nigerian company Andela, which trains African software developers. It has now turned its attention to science. The organisation will achieve its objective by focusing on building tools and technology, bringing scientists from across the world together and growing a movement to fund more scientific research.  Wiping back tears in an emotional opening talk, Chan described her work as a paediatrician.  “I have worked with families at their most difficult moments in their lives, from making the devastation diagnosis of leukaemia to sharing with them that we were unable to resuscitate their child,” she said. “By investing in science today, we hope to build a future in which all of our children can live long and rewarding lives. ” Zuckerberg and Chan acknowledged it was an ambitious undertaking. “It’s a big goal,” said Zuckerberg. However, he said that he and Chan had spent two years talking to Nobel   scientists and researchers and believed it was not unrealistic. “Can we all together work to cure, prevent or manage all disease within our children’s lifetime? We think it’s possible and so do scientists,” Chan added. “It’s not that we won’t ever get sick, but that our children and their children will get sick a lot less. ” The plan won the approval of one surprise guest  —   Microsoft    Bill Gates. He was welcomed to the stage by Zuckerberg, who described him as a “role model and mentor”.  “The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is already doing some very promising work in improving the education of all students. It’s amazing they are taking on another bold challenge,” said Gates, who has flexed his philanthropic muscles by funding projects to tackle malaria and HIV through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the last 15 years.  “We cannot end these diseases with the tools we have today. Only through science can we get an HIV vaccine, a malaria vaccine,” he said. “I am so impressed with the team that’s been pulled together here. I have no doubt that we’ll make great progress on these diseases and literally save millions of lives and make the world a better place. ”

Donald Trump used to dog-whistle racism. Now he just yells it
It used to be that you had to read between the lines to determine that Donald Trump was stoking racial resentments. And it used to be that the subjects of his racial animus were mostly immigrants. But now, increasingly, he’s casting a wider net and amping up his rhetoric. In the wake of two fatal police killings and five officers being gunned down at a rally held in response to those killings, Trump wasted no time in turning his attention within our country’s borders to the Black Lives Matter movement. And having already denounced the movement for its “horrible” rhetoric and “divisive” name at a rally in Westfield, Indiana, last night, he suggested something worse. “The other night, you had 11  —   think of it  —   11 cities potentially in a   stage,” he said. “Marches all over the United States. And tough marches. Anger, hatred  —   hatred started by a maniac that some people asked for a moment of silence for him. For the killer. For the killer. ” The sentence construction here is so poor that the shocking accusation takes a moment to sink in, but what he’s actually suggesting is unambiguous: that the rallies around the country last week were born not out of reaction to the long history of unjust killings of black men at the hands of police, but out of one extremist’s racial animus. Further, that movement members supported the killer in calling for a moment of silence. There is no evidence to support either point, but the latter appears to be one he’s particularly intent on spreading. He mentioned it twice in a recent appearance on Fox News’ The O’Reilly Factor, saying when asked what he thought of the Black Lives Matter movement: “I saw what they said about the police in various marches and rallies. I have seen, you know, moments of silence called for  —   for this horrible human being who shot the policeman. ” Trump isn’t the only one to erroneously lay police slayings at the feet of a peaceful movement. (The morning after the tragedy the rightwing Drudge Report ran with a banner headline declaring, “Black Lives Kills Four Police Officers”.) But he’s the only one to do it and still get to run for president. And the fact that he’s claiming to have personally seen something there is no evidence ever occurred, something that will allow him to blame a large group of minorities for the extremist actions of a few, is part of a pattern. Remember this fall when he claimed to have personally witnessed “thousands and thousands” of Muslims celebrating the September 11 attacks in the streets of New Jersey while watching television? And remember when people looked into it no such footage was ever broadcast, and New Jersey officials said for the record that no such thing ever occurred? This is more of the same. Now he’s going so far as to suggest that Black Lives Matters is “inherently racist” or at least that “lot of people feel that it is”. The reason he gives is that the term is divisive “because all lives matter”. If all lives did, we wouldn’t have to say “black lives matter” any more. Trump has made some   attempts to win over African Americans (after all, unlike the foreigners he demonizes, they actually vote) but more often than not, his efforts backfire. Take, for instance, his saying in the interview with O’Reilly that he can “really relate to” discrimination since he’s experienced it on the campaign. “When I ran for president I could see what is going on with the system, and the system is rigged,” he said, referring to the brief moment earlier this year when it looked like he might not secure the presidential nomination. Of course, as a white male born into a family with tremendous connections and wealth, as a man who inherited an estimated $150m from his father, and as a man who regularly outsources his fights to top lawyers, the opposite is true. Yet it doesn’t seem to help to point out the system is rigged in his favor, and to call him a racist is almost to play into his hands. Because when we say such things the poor white Americans who support him, the ones whose economic decline has gone unnoticed and whose racial resentments are often the subject of liberal castigation, identify with him. Never mind that Trump is nothing like them. That he was born rich and coddled, much more so than the intellectual elites they’ve come to despise. Trump knows how to speak to them. When we say he’s racist, they hear their own names instead, and it only puts gas on his fire.

Tim Burton’s Miss Peregrine flies to top of weekend US box office
Tim Burton’s latest fantastical oddity, Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children, earned a hefty $28. 5m at the US box office in its first weekend on release, but Peter Berg’s acclaimed disaster movie Deepwater Horizon, about the 2010 oil rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, failed to attract an audience.  In a crowded autumn weekend, Miss Peregrine came out on top. The 20th Century Fox release, adapted from Ransom Riggs’ popular young adult fantasy novel, cost $110m, meaning it will need a strong performance overseas, too. It started out with $36. 5m in 59 markets, Burton’s best opening since Dark Shadows, in 2012. “It validates the whole notion of why we made this film, which is something that’s very original and creative,” said Chris Aronson, president of domestic distribution at Fox. “At least I feel that that’s what audiences are looking for. There’s some fatigue with the same old, same old. And if there’s anything this movie isn’t, it’s that. ” Deepwater Horizon, starring Mark Wahlberg, cost at least $110m to produce, featuring a nearly   replica of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. The Lionsgate release was well reviewed but managed only $20. 6m. The film’s performance was another blow for the struggling Lionsgate, which has had difficulty finding hits since The Hunger Games saga finished. Its stock price has fallen and the departure of its movie chief, Rob Friedman, was announced last month. It does, however, have a film, Damien Chazelle’s La La Land, due later this year and expected to be an Oscar favorite. Last week’s top film, The Magnificent Seven, slid to third with $15. 7m in its second week. Disney’s uplifting chess prodigy tale Queen of Katwe, starring David Oyelowo and Lupita Nyong’o, brought in a dismal $2. 6m in its national expansion. Audiences have had a surprising number of   options at the multiplex of late, including another true tale, Clint Eastwood’s Sully (up to $105. 4m in four weeks). Denzel Washington’s remake of The Magnificent Seven aims for similar audiences. Queen of Katwe, directed by Mira Nair, tried to lure families to the inspiring true story of a chess player from the Ugandan slums.  Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore, raised the issue of budget among the trio of originals, particularly in the case of the pricey Deepwater Horizon. “All three of those original movies were expected to do better,” he said. “I give the studios credit because they were good movies. They were not sequels or reboots, and yet you’re coming across audiences who are [not] interested or distracted. ” Originally slated for release in summer 2015, the Zach Galifianakis and Kristen Wiig heist comedy Masterminds sat on the shelf for a year while its distributor, Relativity Media, went through chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. It opened with a mediocre $6. 6m. Two other notable films opened in limited release, with plans for later expansion. Andrea Arnold’s road trip odyssey American Honey, with Shia LaBeouf and newcomer Sasha Lane, debuted with $75, 370 on four screens. Denial, starring Rachel Weisz, opened with $102, 101 on five screens.

Hillary Clinton should learn from Brexit and listen to the young
When Britain completes its messy surprise divorce from the European Union, young Britons will be left dealing with the fallout of a decision they did not support. Brits under 24, regardless of where they lived, overwhelmingly supported Remain. On the day of the referendum, a viral graphic flew around social media showing that those voters who would live with the decision the longest vastly preferred life in the EU.  Young Americans can sympathize. We’ve spent the last year rejecting both Donald Trump’s racism and Hillary Clinton’s   centrism, only to see the two emerge as the last candidates standing. But they continue to ignore the will of young Americans at their peril  —   we may well decide the result of the upcoming presidential election. I had my doubts about Bernie Sanders as a candidate, but there was no doubting his appeal among younger voters. He won massive majorities  —   including among young African Americans, Latinos and women, the same groups where his words fell flat among older generations. Sanders addressed the very real concerns of young voters that our future is grim, and it’s because of decisions made by our predecessors. We live with the worst consequences of an economic system rigged to support financiers over productive working people. We graduate into pitiful job markets at a time of stagnating economic growth, with piles of debt (in the United States) or little hope of being able to afford a house of our own (in the United Kingdom). We’ve seen tuition increases, the privatization and looting of public institutions that prior generations enjoyed, and global environmental damage on a scale never before seen. Despite bearing the disproportionate brunt of conditions they had no say in creating, many younger Britons strongly support staying in the EU  —   but too many didn’t vote in the Brexit referendum. This isn’t surprising. In Edinburgh during the 2014 Scottish referendum, I was struck by the positive vision of the young supporters of the Yes campaign, who believed a better society could be created in an independent Scotland but felt their ideas would never be heard in elections. Perhaps voters like these were not motivated by a Remain campaign whose idea of outreach to young people was sending Ed Miliband to warn of doomsday scenarios. Meanwhile, in the US, Clinton seems unsure whether to try to inspire young people or to appease the worst instincts of older voters, split between a multicultural,   capitalism on one hand, and xenophobic populism on the other. She has walked back prior support for mass incarceration and spoken boldly about reproductive health and economic freedom. But she has also mocked   college and provided momentum to rampant Islamophobia by using the loaded term “radical Islam”. Perhaps the best example her attempt to have it both ways is the draft Democratic party platform, a muddled mess that somehow manages to be both more progressive than in 2012 and far too cautious to inspire the generation that energetically supported Sanders. The great test of whether Clinton understands the generational opportunity will be her selection of a running mate. If she plays it safe with a conservative white male in the hopes of not offending furious older voters, she’ll risk leaving young Americans disgusted by Trump but uninspired by her. On the other hand, selecting a vice presidential nominee with a clear track record of progressive policies, such as an Elizabeth Warren, would send a clear signal that Clinton hears the voice of a generation demanding more from the future than a slightly kinder neoliberalism. Young people are rejecting    economics and welcoming diversity, while large chunks of our older and supposedly wiser compatriots do the exact opposite. If our leaders are willing to listen, this generation can build a new consensus and a fairer and more inclusive society. If not, they will replicate the mistakes of the Remain campaign  —   and that way lies disaster.

The Soviet Union collapsed overnight. Don’t assume western democracy will last forever
Below the medieval citadel in Kazan, two vast frozen rivers turn the landscape white. On a Saturday afternoon there are a few hardy locals shuffling through the icy sludge to take selfies against the mosque, the Christmas lights and the   statues. It’s 25 years since I was last in Russia, trying and failing to revive the left during the chaotic first days of Boris Yeltsin’s economic reforms. Half a lifetime later I am here to address a room full of people who want to talk about replacing capitalism with something better  —   and suddenly we have something in common: now we both know what it’s like to see a system that once looked permanent collapsing. Since I’ve been here, almost everyone who has chosen to come and hear me is involved in either contemporary arts or philosophy. The journalists who want to interview me  —   a public critic of Putin’s policy in Syria and Ukraine  —   mainly write for cultural magazines. These, if not exactly the new rock’n’roll, are the safest intellectual spaces in which critical thought can take place. Since Putin stole the 2011 election, and the subsequent protest movement was suppressed, the young people who took part in it have retreated into an angry silence. It’s not exactly a new situation for Russian intellectuals. Lenin was arrested here in 1887 for leading a student protest and spent most of the next 30 years in exile or underground. Then the Bolsheviks suppressed free speech and political opposition for another 70 years and Russia’s capitalist oligarchs are doing their best to suppress it now. In the face of this, why do Russian artists, philosophers and journalists persist in their belief in change? In short, because they have seen the moral and physical collapse of something that once seemed permanent: the Soviet Union. Alexei Yurchak, an anthropologist at the University of California, Berkeley, decribes the event in a book whose title speaks for itself: Everything Was Forever Until It Was No More. Yurchak was fascinated by the fact that, while nobody predicted the fall, when it happened, many people realised that they had, in their hearts, expected it all along. During the era of perestroika, under Gorbachev, many people experienced a sudden “break in consciousness” as realisation dawned that the fall was imminent. But until then most people behaved, spoke and even thought as if the Soviet system was permanent. And despite their cynicism about its brutality, they went on parades, participated in meetings and performed the rituals demanded by the state. Since Trump’s victory in November 2016, it has become possible to believe a similar collapse will happen in the west, to globalisation and liberal values. The parallels are obvious. We too have lived for 30 years under an economic system that proclaimed its own permanence. Globalisation was an unstoppable natural process   economics simply the natural state of things. But when the country that designed globalisation, imposed it and benefited from it most votes against it, you have to consider the possibility that it is going to end, and suddenly. If so, you also have to consider a possibility that  —   if you are a liberal, humanist democrat  —   may be even more shocking: that oligarchic nationalism is the default form of failing economies. When Yeltsin unleashed penury and collapse in the early 90s, I witnessed Russian society descend into chaos. We held our meetings in the abandoned facilities of Stalinist academia, amid discarded Soviet text books, busts of Lenin, minutes of central committees that no longer existed. There was violence on the streets and larceny in the boardrooms of Russia’s resource monopolies, where ownership fell to whichever kleptokrat could exert the most force. Compared with the chaos of the 1990s, Putinism has felt like a redemption. Putin has, at the cost of diplomatic isolation and the suppression of democratic rights, restored growth, order and national pride. Now all over the world there are  : the Hungarian PM, Viktor Orbán the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan the   French fascist president, Marine Le Pen. If  —   as they desire  —   the west descends into economic nationalism, everybody under the age of 50 will go through the same kind of ideological shock the Russians went through in the late 80s. In economics, political science and the study of international relations there has been, for about three decades, a general assumption that the current framework is permanent. Just as in Soviet academia, if globalisation turns out to have been just a temporary and reversible thing, textbooks once revered will have to lie abandoned. But there’s one big difference. The dissidents of the late Soviet era fought for democracy and human rights under the general concept of “the west”. For us, if xenophobic populism triumphs, there will be no “west” to aspire to: if liberal, democratic societies begin to go the way of Orbán’s Hungary, there will be no external power to help us. Our last great hope will be ourselves. And there are enough of us to stop this second great collapse towards oligarchy and nationalism. We are networked, aware, educated and  —   for now  —   psychologically resilient. As we link together and resist we can learn a lot from those who have been doing it, quietly, in Russia. The young generation of Putin’s critics may wear an overcoat of cynicism, weariness and abstraction, but they possess a   belief in change.

Everton hope to tempt Ronald Koeman with lure of record transfer budget
Everton want Ronald Koeman to succeed Roberto Martínez and hope to lure the Southampton coach with the promise of the biggest transfer budget in their history. Farhad Moshiri, Everton’s new major shareholder, sacked Martínez on Thursday and has earmarked Southampton’s manager as his preferred replacement. The   billionaire faces a challenge to prise the    from St Mary’s, however, even with Koeman yet to commit to a new contract and having just over 12 months remaining on his deal. But Everton hope a transfer budget swelled by Moshiri’s investment, the new broadcasting deal and lucrative player sales  —   with Romelu Lukaku and John Stones likely to leave this summer  —   will persuade Koeman to move to Goodison Park. Koeman’s agent is Guido Albers who, intriguingly, touted another of his clients  —   Frank de Boer  —   for the Everton job last weekend. Ajax announced on Thursday that De Boer is to leave in the aftermath of their failure to make it five titles in a row on the final day of the Eredivisie season, losing out to PSV Eindhoven . De Boer, who won four league titles during his five and a half years with the Amsterdam club, is also under consideration by the Everton board. Albers said the    “would love to join a club like Everton” but there has been no approach for the former Holland defender so far. De Boer will join Ajax on their end‑of‑season tour of China on Friday and part company on their return next Thursday. Moshiri brought Martínez’s   reign to an end following a dire run of form, a second poor Premier League season and clear evidence of support for the manager draining from the fanbase, players and the boardroom, although the chairman, Bill Kenwright, was reluctant to part company with the former Wigan Athletic manager. Everton have won only one of their past 10 matches and their latest anaemic away performance, Wednesday’s   reverse at Sunderland, came with the manager demanding a reaction to a feeble   loss at LeicesterCity on Saturday. Martínez and his players were on a scheduled day off from the club’s Finch Farm training ground on Thursday, when the board discussed his position once again. It had been precarious since April, when what the Catalan had described as a “defining week” produced a shambolic defeat at Liverpool in the derby plus a   loss to Manchester United in the FA Cup  . The decision was taken on Thursday to spare the    from a hostile Goodison in the final game of the Premier League season on Sunday. Everton also postponed the club’   awards dinner at St George’s Hall on Thursday in the wake of the sacking after some fans planned to protest against the running of the club. Duncan Ferguson and David Unsworth, the   coach and   coach respectively, will take charge of the final game against relegated Norwich City, along with the former manager and striker Joe Royle. “Everton Football Club regrets to announce that Roberto Martínez has left his position as   manager with immediate effect,” said a statement. “The chairman and the board of directors would like to place on record their thanks for the dedication and commitment Roberto has shown during his three seasons with the club. Roberto has been a great ambassador, conducting himself, at all times, with the utmost integrity and dignity. He secured the club its highest ever Premier League points total, a place in the last 16 of the Europa League and appearances in both domestic cup  . He has also played a key role in the development of several young players, managing their progression to the Everton first team and international honours. ” Confirmation of Martínez’s departure followed the resolution of talks between Everton and the Spaniard’s representatives over a severance payment. The manager had three years remaining on the lucrative contract he was given by Everton at the end of his first season in 2014. He is believed to have earned at least £3m a year and the club will be left with a substantial severance payment for him and his backroom staff. The assistant manager, Graeme Jones, is believed to have already left while the   development coach, Dennis Lawrence, goalkeeping coach, Inaki Bergara, and chief scout, Kevin Reeves, are also expected to leave. Everton are 12th in the Premier League and lost both of this season’s domestic cup  . Last season’s   finish was their lowest in nine years and having won 21 league games during his debut campaign, Martínez oversaw only 22 league wins in the past two seasons. The former manager has worked tirelessly on improving the academy and   facilities but results cost him support and ultimately his job.

Isis video appears to show children, including Briton, killing captives
Islamic State has released a propaganda video that appears to show five children, one of whom it identifies as British, murdering Kurdish prisoners. The footage, released overnight on Friday, features five boys wearing   clothing and holding pistols, while standing in a row behind five men who are kneeling in orange jumpsuits.  Each of the children is captioned in the video with names that have been used by Isis before to denote a fighter’s country of origin. A white boy with blue eyes is labelled “Abu Abdullah  ” (the Briton) but the identity of the child has not been verified.  A child captioned “Abu    ” (the Tunisian) addresses the men  —   apparently Kurdish fighters  —   promising more violence, according to the BBC.  The other children are said to be Abu Ishaq   (the Egyptian) Abu Fu’ad   (the Kurd) and Yusuf   (the Uzbek). It is not known where the video was filmed. In February, Isis released a video purportedly showing a young British boy, thought to be    Isa Dare, blowing up a car and killing three prisoners inside. He is the the son of the Muslim extremist Grace “Khadija” Dare, from Lewisham,   London, who travelled to Syria in 2012.

From Tennessee to Rafferty and Astrid: parents on their baby-name regrets
It’s often the first thing someone finds out about you, and can shape any first opinions. But what if you have a name you hate, or one that simply doesn’t suit you? Not everyone is happy with their name, and sometimes even the person who gave them it has their reservations. In fact, according to a new Mumsnet survey, 18% of parents regret the name they chose for their child, although only 2% have actually changed it. Here, a group of parents reflect on whether they got it right.  Occasionally, as you might expect having named my child Tennessee, I feel pangs of remorse. I worry that, from his perspective, it will prove a hefty and   moniker to live up to. And, also for any inverse snobbery from others at having called our child such an indulgent name. Then, there’s the abbreviation (Tena) that is perhaps inevitable based around a certain ladies’ incontinence product. The name was on our shortlist thanks to a belated honeymoon road trip across the US (NB: he wasn’t conceived there, no Brooklyn Beckham here) whereby we were beguiled by the inky   hills. Some interpretations suggest Tennessee means “place of deep rivers” and it sounded poetic. We also admire the writing of the namesake author.  I have no regrets about the baby names I picked. When I was pregnant we were living up in the US Santa Barbara mountains on an   ranch. We were staying with a native American who told us about his friend Bear and we instantly loved the name. . For a couple of years my grandma would only refer to Bear as “the baby”. I’ve also had to explain quite often that he isn’t named after Bear Grylls. My parents regretted what they called me  —   I was named Sophie Jasmine, but at nine months they (unofficially) swapped my first and middle names around. They looked at me and realised I wasn’t a Sophie. According to my dad, even as a baby I was outgoing and wanted attention, and they felt Jasmine (Jaz for short) was much more fitting. It was also a more unique name in the 1990s. I’d originally got my name because my dad wanted to call me Sophia  —   a name that my mum didn’t like  —   so they compromised on Sophie. My name now goes better with my surname: Jaz Daze has a nice ring to it. As our family surname was also made up, changed by deed poll to my dad’s stage name, my name has a unique history. If I were to have a child I would be willing to call them what they wanted, and whatever fitted them best.  I named my son Scott just before Neighbours had the big romance between Scott (Jason Donovan) and Charlene (Kylie Minogue). After that I was constantly asked if he was named after Jason Donovan’s character, but I have never even watched Neighbours. The worst part of it, though, was that the name became very popular because of the show. I realised the name is always associated with bad characters in films and TV too  —   such as gang members. When my son was a boy there was a teacher perception that he’d be someone to watch, just because he was called Scott. He proved them wrong, however, because he was always very good. I named him Scott because I come from a Scottish family living in England, and it seemed to be a good idea at the time.  Consumed by pregnancy hormones, I decided to call my son Rafferty. I had no particular attachment to the name before I was pregnant, but for some reason I tenaciously spent months convincing my husband this was the name for us. I regret it now, people think it’s his surname, no one can spell it, and when I introduce him to people they always ask me to repeat the name. Sometimes they respond, saying: “Oh, how unusual. ” I hate shouting his name across a playground and inwardly cringe when I introduce him to people. I wish I had given him a classic name such as William or Benjamin. It doesn’t help that since his birth, a few   celebrities also have his name. We didn’t discus the choice with anyone before making the decision I wish we had now. My husband has come round to it and thinks it really suits our son.  I have no regrets. My wife is Scottish, so we gave our sons traditional local names: Neil and Ian. These names are quite unusual in Germany, where we now live, but neither of our boys has had any problems at school, work or with friends here. Interestingly, we have recently become aware of a local German called Ian, and his family name is almost identical to ours (Weber, which means “Weaver” in English). Before we knew whether we were having a boy or girl, we did consider Scottish girls’ names. Our of our favourites was Eilidh (Scottish pronunciation “Aylish”) until we realised that most Germans would automatically pronounce the name “eyelid”.  I regret the fact that my daughter complains about the spelling of her name. She’s called Madeleine (the French spelling) which is unusual in the US. I’ve reminded her she can choose another name and make it legal, but she’s opted not to. She was originally going to be named either Verity or Celia, which sounded fine with her surname but didn’t look right when written. So, we eventually chose Madeleine  —   completely different from the first two names, and it sounds lovely. Picking a baby name is a big deal. My elderly mother still tells of how her    “stole” the name she’d intended for my younger sister 50 years ago. While I still love our daughter’s name, I do regret it slightly. As my husband is French, we needed a name that would work in both English and French. We settled on Cléo (pronounced  ) which is also a nod to my Egyptian heritage. Unfortunately, we have since found that people constantly mishear it as Claire and when corrected still pronounce it as Cleo. Official documents almost never include the accent on the “e” from the forms I fill in, so her passport and nursery enrollment etc all have the English version of her name on them. It’s not a huge deal, but I can’t help but feel that we’ve landed her with a lifetime of correcting people. I briefly considered changing her name when she was a couple of months old but by then she had already “become” her name, and it didn’t seem right to change it.  We called our daughter Astrid, which we still love but we hadn’t taken into account other people not being familiar with it. One of the midwives called her “Asterix” and her name is often misheard as Ashley and Ashton. When my husband phoned his mum after Astrid was born she thought he said Ashtray. We’ve also had to think hard to come up with   nicknames, although we’re quite pleased with Astridnaut. We picked her name originally because my husband is a fan of Pippi Longstocking books, written by Astrid Lindgren.  I wanted to call my baby girl Rae 15 years ago but got a hugely negative reaction from colleagues and others who said things like, “it sounds like my   uncle”. I quite like the name we called her in the end, but wish I’d stuck to my guns. It is so hard not to be influenced by other people, but nowadays it would not seem odd at all to be called Rae as a girl.

’Overburdened’ public defender’s office assigns client to Missouri governor
Missouri’s lead public defender has appointed the state’s governor, Jay Nixon, to represent an indigent individual in a case. Facing what he called “extraordinary circumstances” in his “overburdened” office, where attorneys work more than 200 cases annually, Michael Barrett said he was taking the unusual step due to budget cuts and because Nixon created the problem. In a letter to the governor released on Wednesday, Barrett, director of the Missouri state public defender system, said the office had faced repeated budget cuts while Nixon had not restricted “a single dollar from [his] own budget”. The governor, Barrett said, also decided to veto a bill that would have provided caseload relief “to an overburdened public defender system”. To avoid closing offices and to ensure poor individuals who face incarceration receive competent counsel, Barrett turned to a rarely if ever cited provision under state law: the power to delegate the “legal representation of any person to any member of the state bar of Missouri”. Barrett said he had not exercised the power before as he believed it would be “wrong to reassign an obligation placed on the state by the sixth and 14th amendments to private attorneys who have in no way contributed to the current crisis”. “However,” he continued, “given the extraordinary circumstances that compel me to entertain any and all avenues for relief, it strikes me that I should begin with the one attorney in the state who not only created this problem, but is in a unique position to address it. ” In an email, a spokesman for Nixon, Scott Holste, said the governor has “always supported indigent criminal defendants having legal representation”. “That is why under his administration the state public defender has seen a 15% increase in funding at the same time that other state agencies have had to tighten their belts and   state employment has been reduced by 5, 100,” Holste said. “That being said, it is well established that the public defender does not have the legal authority to appoint private counsel. The public defender system in Missouri has long been plagued by financial issues, said Barrett, who has been with the system for two years and served as director for one. “[The] problem has existed for years and my predecessors have tried everything under the sun to correct it,” he told the Guardian. The system employs more than 370 attorneys  —   on average, they work anywhere from 125 to over 200 cases annually, Barrett said.  In 2014, according to the St Louis   a study found the system needed an additional 270 attorneys to meet its needs. This year, the system requested a $23. 1m budget appropriation. Nixon recommended only $1m. The state budget enacted last month called for a reported $4. 5m increase. Last month, the public defender system filed a lawsuit against the governor, claiming Nixon withheld $3. 5m of the $4. 5m which was meant to be used to hire 10 staffers and private contract attorneys.  In announcing the suit, the state public defender and defender commission said in a statement the governor had for years used low revenues as a “ruse to encroach upon the budgetary function of the legislature and weaken public defense to the point it can no longer perform its independent function in the criminal justice system”. The impact is felt not only by “marginalized” defendants, the statement said, but attorneys carrying heavy caseloads as well.  Asked if any particular incident stood out as emblematic of the problems he described, Barrett said: “Perhaps the fact that one of our   attorneys has had to recently go through a hearing for an ethical violation associated with diligence, when he simply has too many cases. ”  The costs are also borne by Missouri residents, the state public defender statement said. “The sad irony is that keeping public defense fiscally anemic actually costs taxpayers more money. Because MSPD attorneys are well above 200% of caseload capacity, it is nearly impossible to investigate and competently defend each case. ”  In turn, it said, the state’s prison population has become “artificially” inflated under Nixon, with the state department of corrections’ budget increased by $63m.  “Under Section 600. 064 of Missouri law, only the circuit court can appoint a private attorney to represent an indigent criminal defendant,” Holste, the governor’s spokesman, said of the public defender’s interpretation of the law. “Section 600. 042. 5, the statute referenced by the public defender, authorizes the public defender to ‘delegate’ representation by contracting with private counsel, which requires the consent of the private attorney. ” Louisiana’s public defender system has also attempted to call attention to budget issues. It said last winter it could not take on new cases due to a lack of resources in January it began refusing cases. A judge later released about a   prisoners, saying the public defender system lacked adequate funding to represent them.  Barrett noted that Missouri’s system receives less funding than that of Louisiana. “I hope [Nixon] releases the funding,” he said, “and lets us do our job of providing people their constitutional rights. ”

Five things to talk about when you’re bored with the US election
There are only 36 days left until the US election, and already America is tired. According to a Pew Research Center survey, 59% of Americans were already exhausted by the amount of election coverage in June, when   was four months away. As the election draws nearer and the media hysteria mounts, levels of fatigue are hovering around the “please induce a coma and wake me up when this is all over” mark. Here’s the thing, though  —   nobody is forcing us to keep talking about the elections. We don’t live in Trumpenistan yet we are not all legally obliged to mention Donald Trump’s name in every second sentence. The democratic process does not hinge on us spending hours writing long Facebook posts explaining our views on the candidates in block capitals to echo chambers of our own opinion. We are allowed to talk about other things. In fact, ’tis the season to talk about other things: there are some autumn conversations that are obligatory. Here are five to get you started and get your mind off the election. Every year,   drinks, capitalism’s way of ringing in the autumn, start appearing earlier and earlier. This is not a weird sign of climate change it’s the sign of a weird national obsession. According to Dunkin’ Donuts, “In the New York City area,   drinks were available starting 18 August due to customer feedback that they wanted pumpkin even earlier. ” However, pumpkin spice lattes  —   popularised by Starbucks, but now peddled everywhere  —   really come into their own when the temperature starts to drop, as it has in the last few days in New York. For the next couple of weeks, millions of people are going to be pulling on their Lululemons and Uggs, grabbing their first PSL of the season and exclaiming: “Ah, now I really feel like it’s autumn!” Meanwhile, millions of PSL haters are going to inform you how abominable the beverage is, to ensure you know they’re not “basic”. Pumpkin spice lattes are the 2016 election in a cup. Divisive, disgusting and everyone’s got an opinion. Dammit, we’re back to the elections. Americans take Halloween almost as seriously as democracy. People spend weeks planning their outfits. Somewhere in the US right now, I can guarantee a group text like this is happening: “Let’s all dress up as a sexy poop emoji or sexy Pokémon this year! ”“I dunno   …     What do you think about the sexy breast cancer awareness costume? ”“Some people might find that offensive. What about dressing up like Isis? ”“No, wait, I know! Let’s go as slutty Harambe!” Yes, there really is a sexy Harambe costume because this is 2016. And if   politics is not for you, there’s also a sexy Donald Trump costume and a sexy Hillary Clinton costume. Who says we need to make America great again? It’s already perfect. In New York, dating is a blood sport. When the temperature starts to drop, however, competition really hots up and “cuffing season” starts. Urban Dictionary explains that, as autumn begins, people “who would normally rather be single or promiscuous find themselves along with the rest of the world desiring to be ‘cuffed’ or tied down by a serious relationship”. Cuffing season is often accompanied by “zombieing”. This is when an ex long gone from your life rises from the dead (metaphorically speaking) and starts randomly liking your social media posts or sending you   texts such as “Hi”. If you go to a bar in New York during cuffing season, you will overhear long discussions about if “I should say ‘hi’ back?” (No.) You may also see   couples in matching flannels discussing their   plans. According to a 2015 study, almost 75 million people, about a quarter of the US population, play fantasy football, spending $4. 6bn (£3. 5bn) on it. Meanwhile only 9% of the US chose Trump and Clinton as the presidential nominees. Fantasy football (I’m talking about American,    football, obviously) is an obsessive topic of discussion around this time of year. Unfortunately, I could not tell you what is being discussed Trump’s policies make more sense to me than the ins and outs of imaginary leagues. And it turns out, though, you can’t even escape the nightmare of politics with the fantasy of football this year. Clinton is running ads on fantasy football websites, describing Trump as “like that guy in your fantasy league who talks trash all week and forgets to set his lineup”. Ah, autumn. The leaves are changing colour, the air is crisp and the carbon dioxide is abundant. Environmental scientists recently announced that climate change has reached the “point of no return” with the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere permanently passing the     threshold. Some people will tell you that this is a very real disaster of our own making. Others will tell you that the concept of global warming was a conspiracy created by the Chinese to make US manufacturing  . Other people will post angry messages on social media asking: “Why doesn’t everyone who is worked up about Harambe start getting worked up about climate change, which really matters!” People have always enjoyed talking about the weather it used to be a safe topic of conversation. Alas, this is no longer the case. Now if you tell someone “Gosh, it’s got cold recently” there is a good chance they will reply with their unsolicited opinion on global warming. Which will lead you back to politics. Which will lead you back to the elections. There is really no escaping it, after all.

Third parties aren’t ’spoilers’. They’re at the cutting edge of democracy
NBC News recently projected that Hillary Clinton has surpassed the 270 electoral college votes she needs to be elected president. Based on polls, which have been surprisingly accurate this year, Politico reports that if you include states where Clinton leads by 5% she has 302 electoral college votes. There may be no swing states in 2016. Indeed, no one with her lead at this stage of the campaign has lost the popular vote in 16 elections, since modern polling began. Thomas Frank wrote in the Guardian that with Clinton certain to win, she will ignore populist movements and govern to the right. Glen Ford of Black Agenda Report writes that Clinton is stuffing the entire US ruling class into her campaign: neocons and neoliberals, Wall Street and big business, military and intelligence  —   they are all there, with progressives, blacks and Latinos pushed to the side. Though two establishment big business parties are the tradition in the United States, history shows people’s voices have still impacted the direction of the country. The formula has been: mass movement + independent electoral party = transformational change. By forcing their issues onto the political agenda, people have broken up banking and energy monopolies, won the right to form unions and an   work day, ended child labor and won the vote for women. The entire New Deal came from the Progressive and Socialist parties. All of these changes occurred without a third party winning the presidency. They won their issues by showing enough political support to impact the outcome of an election, which the two parties call “spoiling”. This forced one of the two parties to adopt the issue of the era, or become the Whigs and disappear. There is one example of a third party winning a presidential election. The first political party, the Democrats, was a party of slave plantation owners. The second   political grouping was the Whig party, northern industrialists who profited from slavery. By the   slavery was more valuable than manufacturing, banking and railroads combined. There had been an abolition movement since before the founding of the nation, but it was stalled, even going backward. Abolitionists decided to force their issue onto the agenda by running for office. They lost repeatedly, but over nearly two decades they weakened the Whigs and divided the Democrats. Abraham Lincoln, a former Whig, won a   race in 1860 for the Republicans with less than 40% of the vote. The abolitionist spoilers were hated because they were blamed for the Mexican war by giving the   Democrats the presidency. But, we should be eternally grateful to those who voted in those losing elections to end slavery. They were democracy heroes, using the tools available to force an end to slavery. We face a similar issue today when the issue is corporate power, especially the power of Wall Street and transnational corporations controlling government. Two parties take hundreds of millions from big business and do their bidding. Independent challengers have no chance in these manipulated presidential elections. The hubris of two parties allows them to create a corporation, call it a commission and keep challengers out of the debates. They use fear to manipulate voters. For example, they push the Nader myth  —   despite Gore losing 308, 000 Democratic votes and 191, 000 liberal votes in Florida to Bush, and Nader only winning about 30, 000 of each. They trump up Trump fear despite the reality that he cannot win. Establishment parties nominated two very unpopular candidates. Since we know who will win, why throw away your vote on either? Use your vote to challenge corporate power. Only the Greens, Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka, are challenging corporate power. The movement, already planning “#NoHoneymoon for Hillary” protests, has been growing rapidly since 2011, getting stronger and winning battles. Every vote for Stein makes the movement stronger by forcing Clinton to look over her left shoulder, worried that the Greens will have enough votes to impact her  . To end corporate power, we must vote against it. Just as the US needed democracy heroes to end slavery, we need democracy heroes to end plutocracy.

From virtual communities to real-life enterprises … How Kickstarter generated more than $5bn
The Fed Ex guy is always delivering intriguing parcels to Mini Museum’s headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia, but he’s never allowed to see what’s inside. On Wednesday, it was something very cool from Norway,   Jamie Grove explains  —   though he can’t say any more. But Mini Museum has the fascinating, rare and bizarre delivered every day it’s a unique startup that collects scientific and historic artefacts from around the universe, meticulously divides them and presents them encased in clear acrylic as a “mini museum”. Its first edition included part of the Berlin Wall, some dinosaur dung, part of a palm tree from Antarctica and a sample of the oldest matter ever collected  —   4, 568, 200, 000 years old, to be precise. It’s an imaginative and eccentric project, but one that would not have been possible without a funding campaign that began on crowdfunding site Kickstarter.  Hans Fex, the founder who first had the idea at age seven, was in something of a rut in early 2014 but, within a month, a Kickstarter campaign had raised $1. 2m from more than 5, 000 backers, and the idea propelled him and his   into a new life running a thriving business. “The community rallied around us,” says Grove. “There are just lots of really excited people and that carried over from the first project into the second. We got lucky. ” Grove is one of three people, including Fex, now working full time on Mini Museum alongside five   staff. The second Mini Museum project is now shipping with a new array of of curiosities including a piece of the skin of the Hindenburg airship, part of the   supercomputer and a sample from a fallen limb of a “moon tree”  —   a tree grown from a seed that went to the moon in 1971 on Apollo 14. Mini Museum might be unique in its quirkiness, but its crowdsourced success is not unusual. Professor Ethan Mollick, assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, has been researching Kickstarter since 2012. His latest research analyzed 61, 654 projects from 2009 to 2015 and found that those successfully funded through the platform have created 8, 800 new businesses and organizations over those six years. For every dollar pledged by a project’s backers, another $2. 46 is generated in extra revenue for the creator and Mollick estimates that, in total, Kickstarter has generated more than $5. 3bn of economic value for project creators. The site has created 29, 600   jobs, Mollick estimates, and 283, 000   roles. Nineteen percent of creators said they found a new job opportunity as a result of their Kickstarter project. “Kickstarter has made a really big difference,” said Mollick. “Crowdfunding conceptually completes the circle. We lead elaborate online lives but they rarely touch the real world  —   Kickstarter and others let virtual communities affect the real world. ”  Mollick pointed to   headset Oculus Rift as Kickstarter’s biggest success, which received $2. 5m from backers, largely supporters in the video game community. The success led to interest from venture capital firms and eventually Facebook, which bought Oculus for $2bn in March 2014, but it couldn’t have started (or reignited the     virtual reality market) without the early support and commitment of its crowdfunders. “VR was dead until Oculus. It was a 90s dream, a flop  —   and venture capitalists run from flops,” he said. “It was the same with the Pebble Watch, a category [smartwatches] that had died. Board games. 3D printing. And the resurgence of indie video games  —   these industries have been transformed by Kickstarter. ” “I teach entrepreneurialism and see people pitching and failing all the time,” he said. “That failure can be down to gender, education or race  —   it’s a system designed to help entrepreneurs who are white guys from good schools. ” He thinks that Kickstarter has become a popular part of the funding ecosystem because it allows creators to bypass those systemic biases, yet he has also identified how existing attitudes towards gender influence funding choices on Kickstarter. When the gender of the creator is disguised, Mollick found, women’s Kickstarter ideas are 13% more likely to be funded than men’s. When the creator’s gender was shown, he found that one third of women could be identified as “activists” proactively seeking out and funding projects by other women  —   yet   of women were disinclined to vote for other women. In September 2015, Kickstarter’s board voted unanimously for it to officially become a public benefit corporation, a type of US   organisation obliged to consider the social impact of its business. “It means we operate with the mentality of a public utility,” says Yancey Strickler, Kickstarter’s CEO and  . “[The  ] all have the same ethos and came from that kind of creative background in the 90s where selling out what the worst thing you can do. That’s what we were raised in culturally.  “A challenging commercial landscape can push standards lower, introduce bias or encourage   decisions. ” Strickler says Kickstarter has hardly changed since it launched in 2009, and that its mission has remained the same. “We’ve made it OK to be an amateur or a     …     Kickstarter gives people the chance to live out a dream or give it a shot. The world can be quite dismissive of creativity, but you don’t have to be rich or famous or crazy to set ideas free into the world. ” Where does Kickstarter go from here? Strickler feels the site has only scratched the surface. It is strong in technology and the arts, but could expand into many more sectors. “In some ways Kickstarter is a new model. But it has its roots in patronage, and that’s how the renaissance happened. It’s our responsibility to do better. ” Grove says creators need to tackle the “App Store” problem  —   it is hard to get noticed on a site with so many projects vying for the attention of funders. Creators must mobilise their own   audience and community, he says, and follow Kickstarter’s own guidelines on how to put a compelling campaign together. “You have to be awesome  —   and put the work in. ”

From Beyoncé’s leotard to Bieber’s luxe-grunge – the stylists behind 2016’s biggest trends
Once upon a time, the red carpet was where we looked for celebrity style  —   it was all about princess gowns, diamonds and the kind of hair that takes several hairdressers several hours to create. Unattainable, basically. But who wants to try to replicate that any more? These days, it’s all about the airport, the street, the gym, the selfie. So spare a thought for those    teams. Celebrities now have to look good  —   they have to have A Look  —   wherever, whenever. Off days are not an option. A focus on   style demands a professional. Enter a new breed of stylist who makes sure the Gucci and the Thierry Mugler is laid out for any photogenic stroll, green juice in hand, all to ensure their client’s look is faithfully replicated. There’s the woman who helps Gigi Hadid, say, look the business whether at an award ceremony or flying out of the airport the day after. Or the one who helped turn Beyoncé’s dance studio workout look into Ivy Park. Or, indeed, the one who gave Justin Bieber the wardrobe makeover to match the edgier sound of his Purpose album. Monica Rose, Karla Welch and Karen Langley are three names that you probably have never heard of. But they have more influence on the way people dress than you realise. Here’s how. Langley styled Beyoncé for the cover of Dazed  Confused in 2011 wearing Givenchy, with an   in her hand, a look of pure trashy Americana pop culture. Knowles has moved through several looks since then  —   from sexy bombshell to     football shirt   and some of them have come from Langley’s very   brain, including the tough, spiky plaid shirt and denim hotpants in the Flawless video, which has become a uniform of young women everywhere. While the styling credits for Lemonade are Marni Senofonte’s, Langley is now doing good work as creative director for Knowles’s Ivy Park. The sportswear line  —   very stretchy, very dance routine    —   launched in April at Topshop and JD Sports, and immediately made everyone want to go to the gym. With Ivy Park, athleisure finally went mass market. It is thanks to them you are now actually wearing your leggings all day and have a name for it. LC, There was a point in the   when Kim Kardashian became less famous for what she wore and more famous for how she wore it. That moment came in 2007, after she was shot for a Complex magazine cover and dressed by jobbing stylist Monica Rose. The shoot was a cinch (underwear) but it made names of both Rose and Kardashian, who then started working together. The LA stylist has been working since 2003 but is now known for dressing people by body type, as opposed to look  —   she has worked with Jennifer Lopez, and more recently the Hadid sisters and the Kardashians. Rose follows a specific ratio of   (three parts Balmain to two parts American Apparel) but her overall look is more accessible than that (blink and it’s the sort of thing you can see   at Topshop this season). It’s hardly subtle  —   the focus is on bodycon, thigh flesh and gold, real    stuff  —   with added Roseisms: chokers, always a waist, giant coat. But, in a roundabout way, it’s  . MF, The Justin Bieber model from 2014 was all slick edges, tailored leather and crisp white tees. Preened and preppy, Bieber looked very much like David Beckham’s style heir apparent. Two years later, the look for his Purpose tour was a  . Stylist Karla Welch chose 60 pieces for Bieber’s new “ ” look, which referenced the catwalk as much as River Phoenix and   skater videos. It started a menswear trend that can now be seen on the high street from Zara to HM. It comprises flannelled and oversized garments alongside pieces from Jerry Lorenzo’s Fear of God label and vintage Saint Laurent, topped off by a spinning wheel of   hair styles (from   dreads to a bleached crop in the style of Lolly from Orange is the New Black). Bieber’s move from stylist’s puppet to a more personalised,   look was very much Welch’s plan. As she told fashion site Into The Gloss: “I think you are your own business card. ” PE

Janet Yellen: the case for an interest rate hike in 2016 has ’strengthened’
The Federal Reserve could raise interest rates a second time in one year in the coming months, chair Janet Yellen said on Friday. Delivering her annual speech at the Jackson Hole economic symposium in Wyoming, Yellen said gradual increases in interest rates were “appropriate” and the case for another had “strengthened”. “In light of the continued solid performance of the labor market and our outlook for economic activity and inflation, I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months,” Yellen said. “Of course, our decisions always depend on the degree to which incoming data continues to confirm the committee’s outlook. ” According to Andrew Hunter of the consultancy Capital Economics, Yellen’s remarks and recent economic data improve the odds of a September rate hike. The odds will improve further still if the US economy adds 180, 000 or more jobs this month, he said. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) the   branch of the Fed, has met five times this year each time, its members voted to hold off on raising interest rates. Minutes from the most recent meeting revealed concern over Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and a potential slowdown in job creation. “Several   global risks related to Brexit remained,” the minutes noted. In Jackson Hole, Yellen noted that in the absence of hikes, interest rates have remained historically low, which could hinder the Fed’s ability to fight recession in the near future. By lowering interest rates, the Fed provides an incentive for businesses and consumers to take out loans and to spend money, thus fueling the economy. But as interest rates are already low, the Fed may not be able to lower them as far as it might have in the past.  “Forecasts now show the federal funds rate settling at about 3% in the longer run,” Yellen said. “In contrast, the federal funds rate averaged more than 7% between 1965 and 2000. Thus, we expect to have less scope for interest rate cuts than we have had historically. ”  She ended by saying that despite historically low interest rates, “monetary policy will, under most conditions, be able to respond effectively”.  Earlier this month, 95 economists polled by Reuters said there was only a 25% chance of a rise in September, and most expected just one rate hike this year. The Fed is set to meet in September, October and December, the month seen as most likely for the next hike. Last December, the Fed raised interest rates for the first time in almost a decade, bringing the interest rate range to 0. 25% . 50%. James Bullard, president of the St Louis Fed, said on Friday he was agnostic on when the next rate hike might come. “I do like to move on good news about the economy,” he said in a CNBC interview. “If we got to a meeting and we felt things were looking stronger, that might be a good time to do that. ” Bullard that while the labor market was “pretty strong” and there had been a couple of good jobs reports recently, US GDP remained low. On Friday, the Department of Commerce announced that during the second quarter the economy grew at a rate of 1. 1%  —   up from 0. 8% in the first quarter but lower than the expected 1. 2%.  Hunter, of Capital Economics, said: “With real GDP expanding by just 1. 2% over the past 12 months and inflation continuing to run below target, we still think most Fed officials will want to wait until December before next raising rates. ” On Thursday, some Fed members met with activists from the pressure group Fed Up, who have been attending the Jackson Hole meeting. Wearing green shirts that read “We need a people’s Fed” activists called on the central bank to hold off raising interest rates and focus instead on driving down unemployment rates for black and Latino Americans. San Francisco Fed president John Williams warned the activists that waiting too long to raise interest rates could throw the economy “out of whack”. “It takes a couple of years for monetary policy to have its full effect on the economy and if we wait too long, it could lead to a recession,” he said. The overall unemployment rate in the US has remained steadily at or below 5% since October 2015. In July, the unemployment rate for white Americans was 4. 3% the rate for black Americans was 8. 4% and for Latino Americans it was 5. 4%. Activists say one of the reasons for this is a lack of diversity at the Fed.  Meeting the activists, New York Fed president William Dudley described diversity at the Fed as “pretty lousy”.  “I completely believe in diversity and inclusion and we are working to do better,” he said.

Buckingham Palace to undergo ’essential’ £370m refurbishment
The Queen has been awarded a 66% pay rise to fund a £369m   refit of Buckingham Palace, after the prime minister and chancellor agreed that an increase in the sovereign grant was the best way to fund urgent repairs. Officials warned there was a risk of a potential “catastrophic building failure” if the repairs were not carried out, but backbench Labour and Scottish National party politicians questioned why the monarch was getting so much more money at a time of austerity. The refurbishment, the biggest undertaken on the property since the second world war, will renew the palace’s    boilers, 100 miles of electrical cable, some of it 60 years old, and 20 miles of lead and cast iron pipework.  The Queen will not move out it had been previously thought she would. Labour’s MP for Stockton North, Alex Cunningham, said the plans highlighted the disparity in public funding between the south of England and the  . “I have always respected the fact that we have a royal family, but I know they also have vast wealth and I don’t know what sort of contributions they will be making towards this project,” he said. SNP MP Paul Monaghan said it was incredible that the government was ready to spend such large sums on Buckingham Palace while seeking to cut the number of Scotland’s MPs from 59 to 53 in part to save money. Another SNP MP Hannah Bardell said: “The irony is just today the Tory government was debating whether to cut the number of elected representatives in a   measure. While steps should be taken to maintain and restore such buildings, I’m sure many will find it hard to grasp the millions available to restore Buckingham Palace when Tory cuts are leaving the poorest in our society to suffer. “The Tories should have brought this matter to the House so the details can be properly scrutinised and debated, rather than making it to the press”.  Once the most urgent work has been completed, further work will be undertaken on a    basis, beginning with the familiar east wing, which faces the Mall. By phasing the work over 10 years from April 2017, events such as the garden parties, investitures, state visits and changing the guard will be unaffected. The announcement comes at a time when MPs are considering a £4bn plan for renovations and repairs at the Palace of Westminster. Royal officials said the refurbishment would “ ” Buckingham Palace. Tony   master of the Queen’s household, said: “On completion of the work, we’ll have a palace fit for purpose until 2067. ”  David Gauke, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said ministers would hold the royal household to account to ensure “every penny spent achieves the greatest value for money”. The sovereign grant is the funding formula under which the Queen normally receives 15% of the annual profit from the crown estate. The trustees recommend she receive 25% for the 10 years the work is taking place and the grant should be returned to 15% when building work is finished in 2027. Conscious of the possibility of adverse public reaction to the enormous cost in times of austerity, one source indicated it was hoped it would appeal to peoples’s “sense of nationhood”. Though the palace is the venue for glittering state occasions, royal officials have long complained of the crumbling building and the need for it to be updated. Examples include a chunk of masonry falling from the front facade several years ago and narrowly missing the Princess Royal’s car and staff reportedly resorting to catching rainwater in buckets to save art works. Last year, when a workman tried to carry out repairs to the Queen’s private   toilet, the whole structure reportedly came away from the wall. The Queen spends one third of her working year at Buckingham Palace, which is effectively her administrative headquarters, even though it is her least favourite royal residence. Dating back to the 17th century, the palace has 775 rooms, including 19 state rooms, 52 royal and guest bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices and 78 bathrooms. First used as a palace by Queen Victoria, it has not been redecorated since 1952. About 300 staff work in the palace and up to 125 will move into temporary accommodation in the garden during the refurbishment. Among fixtures and fittings to be replaced will be 5, 000 light fittings and 2, 500 radiators. The occupied royal palaces are held in trust for the nation and are not owned by the Queen, with the cost of maintaining them borne by the taxpayer. The royal household has been criticised in the past by MPs on the public accounts committee for “not looking after nationally important heritage properties adequately”. Helen Goodman, Labour MP and member of the Treasury committee, said the timing of the announcement was bad. “The government has stopped providing grants for the building of social housing to rent and yet can give a straightforward grant to Buckingham Palace,” she said. Graham Smith, of   campaign Republic, described the cost as an absolute disgrace. “The obvious question is why have the royals let it get into this state? Why haven’t they raised revenue through opening up all year round? If the royals can’t look after the buildings and raise their own revenue to fund maintenance it’s time to give them up.

Photographer captures images of uncontacted Amazon tribe
A photographer has captured images of an uncontacted Amazonian tribe after his helicopter flight took a detour to avoid a rainstorm and happened to fly over their longhouse.  “I took the camera and started photographing,” said Brazilian photographer Ricardo Stuckert. “I didn’t have much time to imagine what was happening. ” It was a moment of luck for Stuckert. He spotted the building while in Acre, a state in   Brazil near the Peruvian border, on his way to photograph a contacted indigenous group for a book he is working on. On the return flight, on 18 December, he was able to grab more images that provide tantalising clues to the lives of uncontacted tribes. Brazil has about 80 such groups but their existence is increasingly threatened by illegal loggers, miners and drug traffickers.  He was impressed with the body paint on one of the men, which he saw as camouflage. “When it is cold we put clothes on. They put that paint to protect themselves,” he said. “I thought, ‘You have to photograph this, it has to be preserved’. ” Three isolated groups live in Acre state, said José Carlos Meirelles, an expert in Brazil’s indigenous peoples who was also on the flight.  “At times a little detail could reveal a lot, and as the photos have wonderful definition we can get closer to the details,” he said. In 2014, a fourth isolated tribe from Acre state, the Txapanawa, made contact. Some of them told Meirelles  —   who has 40 years of experience with indigenous peoples and now works for the Acre state government  —   they thought helicopters were something magical, or a huge bird, and had no idea people were inside until he told them. Meirelles first saw signs of the tribe that Stuckert photographed on expeditions in 1988, and was on a BBC flight in 2010 that took high altitude footage of them. “They use axes, machetes, pans, they do know our world but they know very little of it. They don’t have any idea of the confusion that we are,” Meirelles said. He believes there are around 300 people in the tribe, who farm bananas, sweet potato, manioc and peanuts, as well as hunting and fishing. He was pleased to see them looking healthy, despite concerns in recent years about threats to other groups in the area, especially on the Peruvian side of the border. He said no one knows the tribe’s name.  “We call them the Indians of the headwaters of the river Humaita,” Meirelles said. “They never made contact with anyone, we have no idea what language they talk and who they are. Fortunately we don’t know. The day we find out they will start to have problems. ” Authorities perplexed as more than 100 members of clan that has almost no contact with outsiders threaten to cross river

I spent 28 years on death row
I was 29 and mowing the lawn at my mother’s house in Birmingham, Alabama, on a hot day in July 1985 when I looked up and saw two police officers. When my mom saw the handcuffs, she screamed. They asked me whether I owned a firearm, and I said no. They asked if my mother owned one, and I said yes. I asked the detective 50 times why I was being arrested. Eventually, he told me I was being arrested for a robbery. I told him, “You have the wrong man. ” He said, “I don’t care whether you did it or not. You will be convicted. ” At the station, it became clear I’d been at work when the robbery occurred. The detective verified this with my supervisor, but then told me they were going to charge me with two counts of   murder from two other robberies. They said my mother’s gun was the same kind as the one used at the crime scene, and that I matched the description of the man they were looking for. That was enough for them to pursue charges. When I met my appointed lawyer, I told him I was innocent. He said, “All of y’all always say you didn’t do something. ” I might have seen him three times in the two years I waited for trial. The only evidence linking me to the crime was the testimony of a ballistics expert who said the bullets from the murder weapon could be a match to my mother’s gun. They found me guilty and on 17 December 1986 I went to death row. On death row, the day starts at 2. 45am. At 10am they bring lunch. Dinner was at 2pm. And that was it. They don’t care about actual mealtimes: they say they have to get through everyone, so they start early. The cell was 5ft x 7ft. You spend about 24 hours in there. For three years I didn’t say a word to another human. I had to watch 54 men walk past to be executed. My cell was 30ft from the chamber and I could smell the burning flesh. There were 22 who took their own life. Going into my fourth year, I heard the man in the cell next to me crying. He told me his mother had died. I said, “Well, now you have someone in heaven to argue your case. ” The next morning, it was as though a light had come on: my sense of humour was back. I let my mind travel. I visited the Queen I married Halle Berry. My mind went everywhere, and at night I’d come back and check on my body. Without lawyer Bryan Stevenson and the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) I wouldn’t be where I am now. I wrote to him after seeing him on TV one day while being walked back to my cell. I got to meet him in 1995 and finally had someone to fight for me. He hired a ballistics expert and when we got the news that the bullets didn’t match, we went to the attorney general. They refused to take an hour to   the case because it would be a “waste of taxpayers’ money” and I sat on death row for another 16 years. EJI kept pushing for a retrial and eventually, on 3 April 2015, the State of Alabama dropped all charges. I was released that same day. I couldn’t take it in: when you’ve been locked up for nearly 30 years, nothing is the same. It was like walking out on to another planet at the age of 58. Someone had to introduce me to the internet. My mother had died, but I was fortunate to have a best friend who let me move in and who supported me. In jail, you spend all your time thinking of the things you’re going to eat, only to get out and discover you want nothing. I bought a   bed  —   after sleeping in the foetal position for years, I dreamed of stretching out. I’ve been out of prison for a year and half now, and I have yet to stretch out. Every night, I go outside and look up at the stars and moon, because for years I could not see either. I walk in the rain, because I didn’t feel rain for years. Now, I am determined to go wherever I am asked to help end the death penalty. I am so thankful that I get to travel with Lifelines and EJI, and share my story. I’ve never had an apology, but I forgave those involved in my conviction long before I left prison. I didn’t forgive them so they can sleep well at night. I did it so I can. • As told to Fran Singh, Do you have an experience to share? Email experience@theguardian. com

Teenage rape victim dies after setting herself on fire in Morocco
Moroccan authorities are investigating the death of a teenage rape victim who set herself on fire after her alleged attackers threatened to publish photographs of the ordeal, a rights group has said. The Moroccan Association of Human Rights said an autopsy after the girl’s death last week showed that she was pregnant. The AMDH Marrakesh head, Omar Arbib, said “eight young men abducted the girl,” then 16, last year from Ben Guerir, 43 miles (70km) north of Marrakesh, “and then took turns to rape her”. Her family lodged a complaint and police arrested seven suspects, who were referred to the prosecutor for questioning, Arbib said. An eighth suspect was later arrested. However, according to Arbib, the prosecutor granted the suspects a provisional release. After being freed, he said, they threatened the victim, saying they would “publish pictures of the rape which they had taken with their mobile phones unless she dropped the complaint against them”. “This is the reason why last Friday she set herself on fire,” Arbib said. The girl suffered   burns and died the following day in hospital. Her death prompted the prosecutor to order the rearrest of six of the eight suspects who were detained, Arbib said. It was not immediately clear why the other two suspects were not rearrested. In 2011, Morocco adopted a new constitution enshrining gender equality and urging the state to promote it, but concerns remain around sexual harassment. According to Moroccan NGOs, 80% of sex attacks affect children aged mostly between 5 and 14. In many cases, the assailants are family members. In January 2014, Morocco abandoned a highly controversial law that allowed rapists of underage people to escape punishment if they marry their victims. The legislation made headlines globally in March 2012 when Amina Filali, 16, killed herself after being forced to marry the man who had allegedly raped her and remained free.

’Yes we cran’: Barack Obama pardons Thanksgiving turkeys one last time
“Look, I know there are some bad ones in here, but this is the last time I’m doing this, so we’re not leaving any room for leftovers,” said the president of the United States,    and most powerful man in the world. Yawn! said Austin Robinson,    nephew of Barack Obama, standing at the president’s side in a blue and grey sweater. Possibly aware of the     gesture, Obama looked down at the boy and asked: “How am I doing? Good? Thumbs up?” Austin smiled. Change had come to the White House. Since 2009 Obama has performed the traditional pardoning of the national Thanksgiving turkey while his daughters have humoured him and his terrible puns, with expressions betraying amusement, bemusement and boredom. But on Wednesday the door of the Oval Office swung open and there was no sign of Malia or Sasha. Instead Obama was accompanied into the rose garden by Austin and    Aaron, sons of his wife Michelle’s brother Craig Robinson, on a sunny but crisp November afternoon. They were admirable deputies, even when it came to irreverently timed yawns. As for Uncle Barack, far from being downcast about the prospect of handing over the White House keys to a man he warned would flush his legacy down the toilet, the mood was jovial, liberated, even a little demob happy. And for White House staff, plunged into tearful despair by the election result, it was nine minutes of daft escapism. Obama admitted that he has previously embarrassed his daughters with “a   of dad jokes about turkeys”. He added: “This year they had a scheduling conflict. Actually, they just couldn’t take my jokes any more. They were fed up. ” Austin grinned. Fortunately, Obama continued, he had by his side the two nephews, who, unlike Malia and Sasha, “have not yet been turned cynical by Washington. They still believe in bad puns. They still appreciate the grandeur of this occasion. They still have hope. ” The president added mischievously that he had not yet told his daughters “we are going to do this every year from now on. No cameras. Just us. Every year. No way I’m cutting this habit cold turkey. ” With that he raised a hand and grinned at his watching staff, who groaned, then turned to Austin: “That was pretty funny. ” The boy kept smiling. When Obama said he wanted to leave it all out on the field in the final year of his presidency, few realised he meant every last gag imaginable. “I want to take a moment to recognise the brave turkeys who weren’t so lucky, who didn’t get to ride the gravy train to freedom, who met their fate with courage and sacrifice and proved that they weren’t chicken. ” A baby in the audience yelped. Obama: “Oh, it’s not that bad now, come on. ” He laughed. A year ago at the same event, Obama had poked fun at the Republicans vying to succeed him, “a bunch of turkeys trying to win their way into the White House”. This time he resisted the temptation to joke at   Donald Trump’s expense. Instead, after a deeply polarising election, he made a plea for unity: “We have to see ourselves in each other because we’ve all got families we love and we all have hopes for their better future and we lose sight of that sometimes and Thanksgiving’s a good time for us to remember that. We have a lot more in common than divides us. ” Austin peered at the president’s lectern, perhaps wondering how much more of this there was. The answer was not much. Obama went on to pardon Tot and its backup Tater (“the  ”) both   old,   turkeys raised in Iowa. Schoolchildren from the state had submitted pairs of names for this year’s turkeys. Austin and Aaron got to touch Tater’s white feathers. “Kind of soft, huh?” said Obama. The bird stood and flapped its wing enthusiastically. “Right on cue!” the president laughed. The turkeys had stayed at the prestigious Willard Intercontinental Hotel near the White House on Tuesday night. The White House had asked Twitter users to vote for which turkey should receive the pardon, though both did. It provided a biography for each bird: Tater’s favorite snack is worms, and Tot prefers tomato slices. They will be on display for visitors at their permanent home at Virginia Tech’s newly built “Gobblers Rest” exhibit where they will be cared for by students and vets. George HW Bush was the first president to formally pardon a Thanksgiving turkey, though tales of spared turkeys go back to Abraham Lincoln’s presidency. In 2014 a Republican official accused Malia and Sasha of looking bored and said they lacked class the official later apologised. For all its frivolity, the ceremony is just one example of soft power: there are countless such public events where the US president is required to display class, elan, grace and wit, greeting celebrities and citizens with an easy manner. It will be a test for Trump. For his part, Obama conjured one more deathless phrase: “Yes, we cran. ”

Want a vacation? Send your family away
My husband and daughter recently went on a   trip, leaving me all alone, save for two silly medium   and a cat. My preconceived notion of what would happen: by minute five, I would be looking around wildly, wearing a minidress, with the walls taking the shapes of hands reaching out to get me. Half an hour later, I would be   and prowling the joint with a butcher knife, slicing invisible foes. And, eventually, myself. My family would arrive home to find happy animals gnawing contentedly on my meaty bones. But it didn’t go that way. In fact, I had a whale of a time. Life surprised me with a   and deeply magnificent  .  The first night they were gone, I didn’t come straight home from work. Instead, I went to a health food store and loaded up on nutritious stuff to eat while they were away. Taking as much time as I wanted to sniff a great quantity of health and beauty products, I felt the air around me change. I was alone. If my car broke down, if I tripped on the stairs, if I saw a thing on the internet. There was no one to hear my cries or giggles. Later that night, time began to expand. I had nothing to do. Nowhere to go. No one wanted anything from me, and I wanted nothing from anyone. I was truly home free.  What is it about being alone for any stretch of time that causes pantlessness? Soon I found myself chilling in my underwear and a   like every   comic ever. This ensemble lends itself to lounging like a melted clock everywhere imaginable. Couches, beds, floors. Even though I went to work as usual every day, it didn’t break my reverie. I felt each night rolling over me like a warm black wave of dissolution. I did complete some projects, though. I painted a nightstand, and moved a large bookcase, and put some new knobs on some closets. I sorted out things and dispatched them. I cleaned out my closet. Since I didn’t want to go shopping again, I ate all the food I bought, including aspirational items like   flax and quinoa tortillas and fennel. I made ratatouille. I cooked coconut curry. I baked a pumpkin loaf and ate the whole thing, standing, in my underwear. Both the maiden and spinster in me showed themselves. The dogs weren’t as blissed out as me. They very much don’t like things to be irregular. This was everything irregular. They guarded me all night, which meant a lot of barking and running up and down the stairs and then feeling a little scared to come back up the stairs by themselves so I would have to go get them. I stayed up much later than I normally would. Watched terrible movies, and didn’t finish them. I listened to the house and its sounds, audible or not. I entered into deeply wordless states. My heart beat. Leaves rustled in my window. Cars drove by at night, their shadows sliding over my bedroom walls. This glorious state is called “no mind,” I believe, and I didn’t have to go on a retreat or take a class or even sit on an swanky, dedicated cushion. There was a full moon on the summer solstice  —   the legendary “honey moon”  —   and I took the dogs out for a viewing but I couldn’t see it anywhere, until I got a glimpse of a low golden disc through a small gap in the trees. It disappeared, so I had to walk a bit of a distance up to an empty field to see it. I wondered if I should be prowling around in the dark on my own, even with two “fierce” dogs to protect me? And I decided that I should. I walked up to the field, and looked at the moon, giant and  . I was fine. What was I thinking? Nothing. Nothing at all.

America under Trump must not overlook the importance of women in battling HIV
Over the course of more than a decade, the US government spent in excess of $41bn (£33bn) on HIV prevention and treatment without investing in targeted prevention for adolescent girls and young women abroad. Adolescent girls were instead lumped in with adult women in prevention programmes such as prevention of mother to child transmission, which was a critical intervention but did not address the unique health needs and risk factors for girls. In parts of Africa, 90% of new infections in adolescents occur in girls, so this left an enormous gap.  The US investment mainly supported   antiretroviral treatment for 7. 7 million men, women and children, as well as HIV testing and counselling for more than 14. 2 million pregnant women (leading to 240, 000 infants born  ) and HIV testing and counselling for almost 58 million people. But when it came to young adults, pressure from conservative religious organisations and policymakers prompted the US to spend $1. 4bn on   and    programmes. These initiatives have had no impact whatsoever on reducing new HIV infections, regardless of where they have been implemented.  But in 2014, America turned a corner with the advent of a   programme for HIV prevention in adolescent girls and young women. The scheme prioritises social and educational tools in addition to biomedical interventions in 10 countries across   Africa. About $385m has been allocated for this programme through the Dreams partnership, a   collaboration with other aid organisations.  Through the partnership, girls have access to   reproductive health services and information about consistent use of male and female condoms,   prophylaxis, HIV testing and counselling, and other contraceptive choices. As sexual violence is a contributor to the spread of HIV among girls and women, there is also a focus on learning about violence prevention and   care, including   prophylactics that can prevent HIV infection after rape.  The programme has put into use the Girl Roster, a new tool created by the Population Council to identify girls who are particularly at risk of HIV and hard to find, with prevention efforts focused accordingly. Dreams also provides girls and their families with access to financial literacy and savings education programmes.   Implemented by medical providers,   organisations and schools, the scheme promises real progress for girls. But while it could have   effects in combating HIV, it cannot survive on private backing alone.  Funding cuts to US foreign aid are not the only danger. The threatened reinstatement of the “global gag” rule  —   an executive order that restricts US foreign aid from supporting any organisation that provides   activities, even with   funds  —   could have potentially devastating consequences for the Dreams programme. If the policy is reinstated by the incoming Republican administration, funding could end for some of the most innovative and promising partners for adolescent girls, who need a variety of services to prevent HIV, including access to contraceptives and violence screening services. This only hurts the fight to combat HIV.  While Donald Trump may not yet have a governing record on the health and rights of women and girls,    Mike Pence’s record is long and vexing. Pence, the outgoing governor of Indiana and former Republican congressman who is heading up the Trump transition team, has an extensive record of championing policies that are hostile to women, science, and human rights.  Pence is a fierce proponent of   education as part of domestic and foreign HIV funding. As a member of Congress, Pence supported legislation to reinstate the gag rule and, as a governor, he spearheaded the closure of Planned Parenthood clinics in his state. These clinics did not perform abortions but did provide testing for sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV. Under his administration, Indiana experienced the largest documented outbreak of HIV infections in two decades.   Other Trump hires seem similarly unpromising for women’s health policy. As governor of South Carolina, Nikki Haley, who has been named ambassador to the UN, rejected   matched funds through the Affordable Care Act that would have contributed to HIV treatment for   people. This despite South Carolina’s high rate of new HIV infections, which has had a devastating effect on African American women.  Just last week, Michele Sidibé, the UNAids executive director, called for action in helping to prevent HIV infections among girls and young women in Africa. He said that thousands are still infected each week, making the UN target of reducing new infections to fewer than 100, 000 a year by 2020 way off course.  As we mark World Aids Day with a   administration looming, we must redouble our commitment to advancing the health and rights of women and girls. Advocates, donors and NGOs must work harder than ever to fight for continued investment in HIV prevention for adolescent girls and young women.   Moreover, we must be vigilant in our fight against policies that pull the rug out from under women and girls and threaten global public health outcomes.  The bottom line is that we can’t turn the tide on HIV without women and girls.

Park and Recreation’s Leslie Knope writes reassuring letter to America
Following in the footsteps of Michael Moore, Amy Schumer and Jennifer Lawrence, Leslie Knope  —   the relentlessly positive public servant from Park and Recreation, who is played by Amy Poehler  —   has chipped in with a letter to America after Donald Trump’s win in the presidential campaign. The fictional character, who has been compared to Hillary Clinton, begins: “Amidst the confusion, and despair, and disbelief, it was suggested to me by a very close friend of mine (I won’t say her name, to protect her identity) (Ann. It was Ann) that perhaps a few people would enjoy hearing my thoughts on this election. ” Originally appearing on Vox, the letter continues with a typically Knopian anecdote about a fourth grade social sciences lesson involving a cartoon tortoise named Greenie, and a jaguar named Speedy, who strike resemblances to the Republican and Democratic nominees. “Rick Dissellio read a speech from Speedy, in which he promised that, if elected, he would end school early, have extra recess, and provide endless lunches of chocolate pizzandy (a local Pawnee delicacy at the time: deep fried pizza where the crust was candy bars),” she writes of the   option. Knope’s speech from Greenie was a more measured approach from a candidate “who promised to go slow and steady, think about the problems of our school, and try her best to solve them in a way that would benefit the most people”. After losing the election Knope learned to except it because that’s how democracy works. “I acknowledge that Donald Trump is the president,” she adds. “I understand, intellectually, that he won the election. But I do not accept that our country has descended into the   slop pile that he lives in. ” While directly addressing young girls, she writes: “Our   is everything you should abhor and fear in a male role model. He has spent his life telling you, and girls and women like you, that your lives are valueless except as sexual objects. He has demeaned you, and belittled you, and put you in a little box to be looked at and not heard. It is your job, and the job of girls and women like you, to bust out. ” The Parks and Recreation character became a cult figure, and the show also played host to a cameo from Michelle Obama, as well as being considered part of a new wave of shows with powerful female leads. “He is the present, sadly, but he is not the future. You are the future. Your strength is a million times his. Your power is a billion times his. We will acknowledge this result, but we will not accept it. We will overcome it, and we will defeat it,” she writes. “Now find your team, and get to work. ”

Trump deletes tweet with image of the star of David, Hillary Clinton and money
Donald Trump deleted an image of Hillary Clinton and a   star from social media, following accusations of antisemitism on Saturday given the star’s placement over an image of money and his repetition of the controversial phrase “America first”. The original graphic, which depicted the Democratic presumptive nominee over a pile of money, contained the text “most corrupt candidate ever” in a   star, reminiscent of the Jewish star of David.  Almost four hours later, Trump tweeted out a second image, with the text inside a circle instead of a star, though the star’s points were still visible on the edge of the circle. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Moments after the first image was published, commenters accused Trump of stoking antisemitism with offensive imagery. Clinton’s national spokesman Josh Schwerin quickly noted the imagery, asking: “Why is there a Star of David?”  Her economic policy adviser Michael Shapiro was more explicit with his criticism, writing: “This new divisive dogwhistle isn’t [a] surprise. ” Republicans who oppose Trump also seized on the image. Patrick Ruffini, of the   data company Echelon, called it an “  dog whistling tweet”. Marc Lamont Hill, a professor of African American studies at Morehouse College, called it “textbook   imagery”. Unlike the original graphic, the updated image contained the text “America First” a phrase the   League has previously asked Trump to stop using because of antisemitic connotations. The phrase gained currency in the 1930s with Americans who wanted the US to avoid involvement in the second world war most prominent among them was Charles Lindbergh. The American pilot was welcomed in Nazi Germany several times before the war and in 1939 wrote that “racial strength is vital”. “Our civilization depends,” he wrote in Reader’s Digest, “on a Western wall of race and arms which can hold back either a Genghis Khan or the infiltration of inferior blood. ” Lindbergh largely led the America First movement in the months before the war, advocating for neutrality. In its plea to Trump, the ADL described Lindbergh as a man who “sympathized with the Nazis and whose rhetoric was characterized by   and offensive stereotypes”. The ADL has also given $56, 000 that it received from Trump and his foundation to   and   education programs. The star of David has been used in as a symbol for Judaism in Europe since at least the 14th century, and Adolf Hitler’s Third Reich used the symbol to identify Jews during the Holocaust. In 1948 it was adopted onto the flag of new nation of Israel. The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump’s graphic or language or the ADL’s petition.

If you thought ’Never Trump’ was dead, think again
Even before Monday’s Trump campaign turmoil, where campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was sent packing and a Federal Election Campaign finance report revealed Trump had less cash on hand at the end of May than some of his departed rivals, the wheels seemed to be coming off the Trump bus. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, who tepidly endorsed Trump earlier this month, intimated on Sunday that he only backed The Donald for institutional reasons and that Republicans should vote according their conscience, even if their conscience tells them to oppose the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. “The last thing I would do is tell anybody to do something that’s contrary to their conscience,” he said. Wisconsin Republican senator Ron Johnson, who has yet to endorse Trump, said on Sunday he isn’t even sure Trump will be the Republican nominee. “It’s been my intention to support the Republican nominee,” he told CNN Sunday. “Again, nobody can predict the outcome of this thing. I think things remain reasonably uncertain. ” Perhaps Johnson got the idea that Trump’s nomination is still up in the air from the fact that hundreds of delegates to July’s Republican convention are lining up behind a movement to try to oust the billionaire real estate mogul as the nominee. According to the   poll released on Tuesday, 48% of Republicans say they wish someone other than Trump would be the Republican nominee. While it’s remarkable that Trump has been unable to unite the party behind him since forcing his last two rivals out of the nomination contest in early May, it’s not surprising. Though rumors abound of a new and improved Donald Trump about to emerge, all that has manifested so far is the same old Donald. Since earning the title of “presumptive” GOP presidential nominee, Trump has continued to be his bombastic self, launching a racist attack against a   judge of Mexican heritage, responding to the Orlando massacre by first congratulating himself, ravaging Republican politicians who he doesn’t believe have been sufficiently supportive and banning news outlets from his events whose coverage he doesn’t like. One could go on. From the beginning, many liberals expected the Never Trump movement to fade away once Trump secured enough delegates to win the nomination. But that’s only because they have a profound misunderstanding of what the movement represents. Never Trump was never just about stopping Trump from winning the GOP nomination or coaxing an alternative candidate to run third party. Fundamentally, it’s a resistance movement to everything Trump represents. Trump’s support within the Republican party is multifaceted. There is Trump’s base that supports him unwaveringly. There are those who support him because they fear Hillary more than Trump, but could be convinced to support a third party if a serious more conservative contender emerged. And then there are the stalwart Never Trumpers. The Never Trump movement is not uniform. Some Never Trumpers say they will never vote for Trump or Hillary Clinton and will stay home, others say they will vote for Clinton if no serious   candidate emerges, while still others say they will vote for the Libertarian party contender or write in a candidate. Some Never Trumpers oppose Trump because of his character and temperament, others oppose him because of profound domestic and foreign policy disagreements, still others oppose him because his authoritarian tendencies and the threat such predilections would pose to the American system. (Many, of course, like myself, oppose him for a combination of these reasons.) But what separates the Never Trumpers is insignificant compared to that unites them. Simply stated, all Never Trumpers believe Donald Trump is a lying, unstable megalomaniac wholly unsuited for the presidency and they can’t in good conscience cast a presidential ballot for him. And these aren’t the type of squishy Republicans who decided to support Barack Obama over the Republican nominees in 2008 and 2012. Most Never Trumpers I know would have sprinted to the polls to vote for someone as conservative as Ted Cruz. If Trump weathers the current political tempests and arrives at the general election without a serious conservative third party to contend with, it is true he will probably consolidate most   Republicans behind him, even many who loathe him, either out of party tribalism or out of fear of Hillary Clinton’s supreme court picks. But there is nothing Trump can do to bring back the stalwart Never Trumpers into his camp  —   because he has already shown who he is as a person and a candidate. Trump could pick Ronald Reagan’s ghost as his   and not win over a single Never Trumper, because there is little evidence Trump listens to anybody other than his volatile and uneducated gut. There’s still a possibility Trump may not get that far, however. Every day brings a new scandal that pushes more Republicans toward the Never Trump camp. Could he be deposed at the convention? Unlikely, but not impossible. Could a serious conservative   candidate still emerge? The effort to recruit one continues apace. But the Never Trump movement doesn’t depend on there being a Never Trump alternative candidate. It’s a resistance. It won’t go away so long as Trump remains a presidential contender.

US veterans on Chilcot: we need our own inquiry to avoid repeating mistakes
Following the devastating British inquiry into the 2003 invasion of Iraq, American veterans and their families have warned that the US is liable to repeat the mistakes without a similarly comprehensive investigation. The UK’s Chilcot inquiry was released on Wednesday, and while it is no secret in the US that the invasion was a failure, nothing so damning as the 2.  British inquiry has been released by an independent US government body.  “The Chilcot report is an example of what we could do if there was any kind of political courage to reckon with the   of the global war on terror that we were pushed into,” said Matt Howard, who was deployed to Iraq twice while serving in the marine corps. Congressional reports have shown that the US invasion was based on faulty intelligence, but none were as crushing as Chilcot, which provoked the mother of a British soldier killed in the war to declare former British prime minister Tony Blair the “world’s worst terrorist”.  The inquiry found that President George W Bush and his aides exaggerated intelligence to make a case for invading Iraq, and that planning and preparations for Iraq after Saddam were “wholly inadequate”. “The fact that we haven’t done a report like that  —   and there haven’t been any moves to do that  —   makes it a whole hell of a lot more likely that we are going to go right down the same road and make the same mistakes we did less than 13 years ago,” said Howard. He is now codirector of Iraq Veterans Against the War, which he joined after seeing the gap between how the war was being described by the government and the media and what was actually happening in Iraq.  Nearly 5, 000 US soldiers died in the war and disillusionment is high among those who survived  —   only 44% of veterans who fought in    wars said the invasion of Iraq had been worth it, according to a 2011 Pew Research Center survey. But the response to Chilcot, which supported allegations that the invasion helped spawn terrorist groups like Islamic State, was muted in the US. Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, a prominent    group, did not have a comment on the report. And the same day the report was released, Barack Obama made a surprise announcement that more than 8, 400 US troops would remain in Afghanistan when he leaves office in January.  That was the top story for Stars and Stripes, an independent news service within the Department of Defense that reports on the US military. It covered Chilcot with an Associated Press story  —   “Scathing report slams Blair over botched Iraq war”  —   at the top of its website on Wednesday. The story also ran in the print edition of the paper, which is available to military posted abroad. The story was headlined: “Report blasts UK’s Iraq war intelligence and planning,” and featured a color photo of two demonstrators in Blair and Bush masks whose hands were covered with fake blood.  And while Blair defended his decision in a   press conference, Bush was largely silent on Wednesday, his 70th birthday. He celebrated by cycling with wounded warriors and a spokesperson said on Wednesday afternoon that the former president had not “had the chance” to read the inquiry. “Despite the intelligence failures and other mistakes he has acknowledged previously, President Bush continues to believe the whole world is better off without Saddam Hussein in power,” the spokesperson said in a statement.  Most Republicans offered similarly defiant responses to the report, which also found that the US largely ignored the British government’s advice about the war and the involvement of the United Nations.  “Unfortunately, there hasn’t been the same kind of public reckoning with our own government and country’s involvement in the war in Iraq,” said Howard. He said it was encouraging to see a UK government body take the   to war seriously, but he did not expect the US government to revisit its decisions in such a substantial way.  “I think that a majority of those folks that were behind the decision to agree to invade Iraq don’t have a lot of interest in revisiting that  —   both in terms of how it affected Iraq, the country itself  —   and in terms of how it affected US service members, a veteran community of more than 2. 8 million people, and the families that have to deal with the aftermath,” Howard said.  Those families include Cynde   who has cared for her son for the past 11 years because of illnesses he incurred during his   deployment to Iraq in 2003.    said her son was “100% incapacitated due to   injuries” and though she worked closely with the Department of Veterans Affairs on her son’s case, she was still struggling to get the financial and medical resources she needed to care for her herself and her family.   said “we must learn” from the aftermath of the war, which saw the veterans affairs department overwhelmed and unprepared for the demand for care.  But she was not convinced a report like Chilcot could have real impact on the American families taking care of veterans. “I have noticed that millions of dollars and   are dedicated to defining the problem and there is rarely meaningful outcome directly to the vets and families,”   said in an email.    founded Veterans’ Families United, a    group meant to help veterans and their families access needed resources. She has confronted the dysfunctional US veterans’ care system personally and through the experiences of others who are involved with her group.  “The aftermath of war is complex and confounding and we ‘grassroots’ veterans and families (the less than 1% of the American population that served) are caught in the quagmire of a system that allocated billions of dollars to war and the VA,” she said. “It is an example of exploitation and oppression for those who stood up to end it for others. ”

Bail money funds Louisiana courts. Now this powerful industry is fighting reform
An industry built around a key feature of the American criminal justice system is ratcheting up its resistance to change. As bail reformers score legal victories throughout the US, one prominent New Orleans bail bonds agent, Matt Dennis, compared the threat posed to his industry to Adolf Hitler’s invasion of Europe. In a Facebook post addressed to bail bondsmen and sureties, he said: “The Bail Industry must understand the level of attack facing it today. The organizing, campaigning, activating, etc is being done by our opposition . .. Most recently they have adopted the tactic of Hitlers [sic]   sue   all at once. Just as Hitler   They are focusing on the small towns because they are weak, unorganized, and financially incapable of defending themselves. ” Dennis and his colleagues have based their professions on the money bail system, which requires people to pay their way out of jail after they have been arrested but before they have gone to trial. People who don’t have the money on hand have two options: pay a bail bonds agent to put up the funds, or stay in jail indefinitely.  The commercial bail industry is a powerful institution in Louisiana, thanks to the state’s unique arrangement in which every part of the criminal justice system uses bail to fund itself. “Louisiana is an example of one of the crowning achievements of the bail industry and their control over local and state politics,” said Alec Karakatsanis, founder of the legal nonprofit Civil Rights Corps. “They managed to design a bail statute in Louisiana where every major actor in the whole system depends on the bail system now to fund themselves unconstitutionally. ” Ten percent of every bond in New Orleans goes to the bail bondsman. Another 1. 8% goes to the judges, while the sheriff, public defender, and prosecutor each get 0. 4%. According to a complaint filed by Karakatsanis and others in 2015, judges collect over $1m a year from these bond fees. Meanwhile, 38% of defendants in 2015 were held in jail until trial in part because they couldn’t afford bail. Of those cases, 1, 453 people spent more than 35 days in jail awaiting trial. It doesn’t take nearly that long for a detained person’s life to start unraveling. “Once a person has spent more than 12 hours in jail, even if they are later determined to be innocent, they start losing ground,” said Bill Quigley, a law professor at Loyola University. “At first people lose their job, after losing their job they lose their apartment, with no job and no apartment they lose custody or visiting rights to their kids. ” Dennis argued that people are not held in jail because they are too poor but because of a lack of personal responsibility. “The accused is not the victim,” he wrote in an email. “One is not held in jail because they are poor, they just cannot afford their charges and history. ” The US is just one of two countries with a money bail system. The rationale is to ensure a defendant shows up for trial if they do and are not convicted, they get the money back. Research is mixed on whether or not money bail makes a difference in court appearances, but the practice has allowed the bail bonds industry to thrive. Through associations like the American Bail Coalition, bail bondsmen and the insurance companies that underwrite them have successfully lobbied for laws that raise bail rates and restrict alternative risk assessment tools. But lately, the industry is feeling the sands shifting. A series of lawsuits across the country have prompted cities to end money bail, state lawmakers have passed reforms to limit bail, and some law enforcement officials have disavowed the practice or called it illegal. “After a dozen or so victories [by bail reformers] the industry has started to fight to maintain the current system,” Quigley said. New Orleans is now among the cities facing challenges to its bail system. On Thursday, the city council will decide whether to eliminate money bail for most municipal crimes. If the measure fails to pass, civil rights attorneys say they will sue the city. In his email to the Guardian, Dennis accused bail reformers of “the destruction of public safety”. At a recent hearing, bail bondsmen, judges, and experts brought by the industry came out in force against the legislation. Councilmember Susan Guidry dismissed their claims that the bill she introduced would release dangerous criminals with no accountability. “They’re only in there for municipal charges and they’re going to be out soon anyway,” Guidry said. As the industry resists reform, it’s also trying to adapt. Dennis and other New Orleans bail bond agents lost the battle to block pretrial services in 2012. So Dennis has launched a new venture called Alternatives 2 Incarceration (A2I) that expands the role of bail bondsmen to serve as   supervisors for defendants released by courts. Dennis’ vision is for bail bondsmen to capitalize on the waning support for incarceration by offering  —   and charging for  —   services like drug testing,   supervision, and alcohol monitoring. Organizing around this solution will defeat the “Hitler options,” Dennis wrote in his Facebook post, just after a hearing on the bail ordinance in September. “It was not until the unoccupied countries joined forces and united under a single command structure that Europe was able to defeat Hitlers [sic] Blitz and free the occupied space, he wrote. “Bail . .. must have a plan to occupy the space left behind when the fighting stops. ”

Immigrants fear Trump deportations: ‘This election changed my optimism’
Ivy has lived in the US for most of her life, but with Donald Trump now   she’s gathering her belongings in one safe place in case she is abruptly deported. The   old is one of the more than 741, 500 people the government granted temporary deportation relief to, through Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) policy, and who are now wondering: will I be deported by Trump? “There’s no time for us to just feel, we have to act,” she said. “The bottom line is here and this is it. ” Ivy asked for her full name not to be used because of the influx of hate mail she has received since Trump’s victory. It was not clear how Trump would implement many of his campaign promises, but one of his clearest targets for destruction as president was Daca. He promised to “immediately terminate President Obama’s two illegal executive amnesties” and to ensure that “anyone who enters the US illegally is subject to deportation”.  It is assumed that he is referring to Obama’s 2012 and 2014 executive actions to extend temporary deportation relief to people such as Ivy, who was brought to the US as a child from Macau, the place where she was born, but that she hardly knows, having not returned there in 20 years.  Daca recipients are able to go to school and work in the US for two years. After that, they can   for the program, paying a fee each time. “It’s been like a dream,” said Ivy, whose family is in the US legally.  Ivy is grateful that she was raised in New York City, where immigrants have long been the backbone of the city. But that feeling of appreciation is harder to cling to when faced with the reality that 59. 8 million Americans voted for Trump, whose campaign was defined by   sentiments.  “I think this election has changed my optimism,” Ivy said, before adding: “The system doesn’t work for you, you have to work the system. ” This is the same message being pushed by immigration advocates such as Marielena Hincapié, executive director at the National Immigration Law Center (NILC).  “Trump’s election must serve as a   call for everyone who shares our vision for a more inclusive America that treats everyone with dignity and fairness,” Hincapié said. National Council of La Raza president and CEO Janet Murguía felt similarly a day into America’s new political reality. “We want to reassure our community and our fellow Americans that if the new administration continues to be steeped in the politics of division and blame, then we will continue to stand up and defend the 58 million Latinos in this country, along with the values our nation holds dear: tolerance and inclusion. ”  Advocates have been critical of Obama’s immigration policy, which saw 2. 4 million deportations between 2009 to 2014  —   more deportations than under any other administration in this country’s history. But Trump presents a new, uncertain threat. His policy plans won’t be clear until he is in office, but people are already worried about what will happen to Daca recipients’ personal information. When the program was first introduced, many were reluctant to join because they thought it was an easy way for the government to collect the personal information of undocumented immigrants. That fear had eased, until election night.  “One of the things we’re going to be urging the government to do is to not release those records,” said Thanu Yakupitiyage, senior communications manager at the New York Immigration Coalition. “Those records are private, those records are from individuals who gave their trust to the government and the Obama administration, and that needs to be respected. ” But until Trump’s plans become more clear, Yakupitiyage said the focus is on making sure undocumented immigrants know their rights and prepare for scenarios that could play out during Trump’s time in office.  Oliver Merino, who has been living in the US undocumented since he was 10, began by protesting in his home of Charlotte, North Carolina, and meeting with activists from other communities that were threatened during Trump’s campaign.  “We don’t necessarily have control of what he does but we have control over how we will react,” said Merino.  He said Daca, which he has had for three years, helped him get a job as a museum educator. While he is concerned about losing his Daca protections, he is more concerned about how Trump’s immigration policies could impact his family.  “I’m worried more about people who have been forgotten in this [Daca] narrative  —   people like my mom, my dad, who did not qualify for deferred action,” Merino said. They would have been protected under the other executive action Trump is expected to strike  —   November 2014’s Dapa, which sought to extend deportation protections to more people, including the parents of those who qualified for Daca. This action was effectively blocked by the supreme court in June and has little chance of surviving a Trump presidency.  Merino thinks Trump’s victory has placed greater urgency on people to apply for programs such as Daca, which he is helping his brother apply to for the first time. “It is a fear that maybe the government has your information, but what I always tell people is don’t let fear prevent you from seeking what you’re looking for and to paralyze you and make you go back into a clandestine life,” Merino said.  This was the message being sent on social media in the immediate aftermath of Trump’s victory, where undocumented immigrants rallied around #HereToStay to express their opposition to Trump’s deportation promises.  “Even though this is a setback, this is not the end for us,” Merino said. “We’re here, we’re not going anywhere. ”

From glamour to gunfire: the tourist city of Acapulco torn apart by violence
When mayor Evodio Velázquez’s sparkling white Jeep Cherokee SUV pulls up at the side of the road, patrols of soldiers and heavily armed federal police are waiting for him. Velázquez’s “tourist police” a special unit of young female officers who wear light blue uniforms, stand in a small cluster by the kerb. Nominally law enforcement agents, these young women are really part of Velázquez’s broader marketing effort for the city of Acapulco  —   to add some friendly faces as the first point of contact between visitors revelling on this famous Mexican resort’s golden beaches, and the security forces struggling to keep the city safe.   the sun is rising over the glittering bay but the beaches are mostly empty.   carrying police officers  —   veterans of a   conflict with sophisticated organised crime groups and myriad splinter groups of local street gangs  —   stand on the perimeter, just out of view of the crowd of photographers who have assembled to document the mayor’s press conference. The night before, gunmen with pistols stormed on to a patio on Playa Angosta, one of the city’s most picturesque beaches, murdering two men. Hours earlier, an assassin had walked into a city government office and brazenly killed one of Velázquez’s senior officials. In both cases, the assailants escaped before the police arrived. Throughout the year, gangsters have been dumping bodies in public places and leaving messages threatening Velázquez’s administration. During the first six months of 2016 alone, 461 people were killed in Acapulco, including a long list of taxi drivers, small business owners and security personnel. The Pacific coast resort is again heading for the unwanted accolade of Mexico’s most violent city in 2016, a title it has received every year since 2012. But the mayor is undeterred. With his gelled black hair and crisp   dress shirt  —   unstained by sweat despite the oppressive heat  —   Velázquez narrows his gaze and addresses the reporters: “My government is working to stop crime. I’ll keep working. Acapulco is a city with complications  —   it has to be accepted. But today we’re at over 90% hotel occupancy. People love Acapulco. ” A reporter yells out: “Has the protective barrier around the tourism zone failed?” “I think we have to reinforce it,” Velázquez says. “We have to review and strengthen it. ” “Will there be an effect from the Playa Angosta incident?” “The port is still an option for tourists,” the mayor replies. “We won’t take a step backwards. We’ll keep going. ” As the photographers crowd together, Velázquez joins the squad of tourist police handing out green coconuts to the visitors arriving on the avenue. “Welcome to Acapulco,” he says warmly. The    politician from the leftist PRD party is respected as a local leader who thinks deeply about public policy and isn’t afraid to get out in the streets and talk to his city’s residents. He’s working to improve Acapulco, but it often seems like he faces impossible odds.  The state of Guerrero, where Acapulco is located, is considered one of the least developed, poorest and most problematic states in Mexico. Seven out of every 10 of the state’s 3. 4 million residents eke out a living in the informal economy, in precarious   jobs that don’t provide benefits. Around   of the state’s population lives in poverty.  Guerrero gained international attention after the disappearance  —   and alleged murder  —   of 43 students from the Ayotzinapa teachers’ college in 2014, but has continued to struggle through a constant barrage of unrelated but similarly terrifying incidents over the subsequent years. Mexico’s federal government has sent in trucks full of police and soldiers to patrol the beach, and maintains the narrative that the generalised violence in the mountain towns away from the coast doesn’t affect tourism along the beach front. In 2016, however, that fiction has started to unravel. Although it remains true that most gangs in the area focus on retail drug distribution and extorting small businesses, on multiple occasions throughout the year gunmen shot and killed people in front of visitors on popular beaches. On 25 April, for example, heavily armed gunmen attacked a group of federal police staying at the Alba Suites hotel, starting a prolonged   while terrified visitors fled for cover. On 29 October, two soldiers were kidnapped by a group of armed criminals inside a busy market in downtown Acapulco their cadavers were discovered two days later. From 29 to 31 November, during one particularly violent weekend, 13 people were killed across the city. Together with the press and police, the mayor makes his way down the main stretch of coastal highway, stopping to greet patrons at the beachfront restaurants. “We’re happy to see you,” he gushes. Then he pulls in a group of smiling waiters: “Great guys, thanks,” he beams, shaking their hands. “The perceptions are there  —   but what I’ve learned in politics is to keep going forward,” Velázquez tells me. As the entourage moves onward, a   woman who works as a promoter for a local hotel stops and addresses him. “Give it your all  —   it depends on you,” she pleads. “And we depend on tourism. ” Perched on a cliff overlooking the Pacific, the pastel pink Los Flamingos is one of Acapulco’s oldest and   establishments. The hotel’s    manager was a friend and protege of the actor John Wayne, one of the hotel’s original owners. In the 1950s and 60s, Acapulco emerged as a hidden escape for   celebrities from California. Over subsequent decades, it transformed from a sleepy beach town to a sprawling city with a population of around two million. But Los Flamingos remains a time capsule to an earlier era. Christian Hernandez, a      tourist visiting from Estado de Mexico on the outskirts of Mexico City, lounges with his family by the hotel’s pool. He has been coming to Acapulco since he was a child. “Normally I come three times a year,” he explains. Over the course of his life, Hernandez has seen the beach town evolve. “Acapulco changed. It was a pueblo and now it’s become like Mexico City,” he says. “But you wake up and you still have this view of the sea  —   it’s paradise. ” Hernandez has brought eight members of his family with him, including his primary   children. The unit of soldiers who camp out in the hotel’s garden and stand guard next to the front gate don’t unnerve him he says he has come to see Mexico’s ongoing security problems as just another part of the scenery. “There are a lot of police,” he shrugs. One study recently ranked Mexico as the world’s   country for crime, behind only Afghanistan and Guatemala. “All over the place it’s the same in this country. Everywhere there’s organised crime,” he says. Hotels such as Los Flamingos have their own clusters of loyal clients, but they still rely on the general flow of tourism into Acapulco. Collectively, hotels here are depending on the mayor to rebuild the city’s image. “Acapulco is a city with one million residents and a population of two million during vacation periods. Eighty percent of the population lives from tourism,” the mayor points out. “They work in different professions: cab drivers, tourist services, stores, restaurant owners, nightclub operators   …     People work in fishing [there are] farms that supply the restaurants. ” The veteran holidaymakers from the generation of American visitors who first started visiting Acapulco in the 1950s and 60s remember a beach village scratched out of dense foliage along the flat expanse of sand. Now the houses are tightly packed in a haphazard agglomeration of improvised constructions that stretch close to the top of the adjacent mountain ridge. These residential areas have spilled over the hilltops into new,   barrios such as Renacimiento  —   places that are far from the sea and marked by serious security problems. Since he came into office in   Velázquez has seen Mexico’s federal government focus on dismantling the large trafficking groups that historically operated in Acapulco. The federal police and army have had success in taking out a number of cartel kingpins, but residents regard the new dynamic of gangs and splinter groups as just as dangerous. Ten years ago, they shared stories and rumours of   hitmen from out of state driving luxury SUVs and carrying out     attacks. The players have changed but the threat level remains largely the same: in Renacimiento, residents see young gangsters selling drugs on street corners, and all too frequently hear about teenage gunmen carrying out hits. And yet, for Hernandez and thousands of other Mexican   and   families who visit Acapulco every weekend, the port city still offers an affordable, accessible chance to spend time with family and enjoy the sun and the beach.  “At first, in the years when [former Mexican president] Felipe Calderon declared war on drug trafficking, it was terrifying to go out to the streets,” Hernandez recalls. “There were killings and people were scared to go out  —   they thought we were at war. But as the years pass you learn to live this way. You learn to live with fear. ”  Mayor Velázquez knows, however, that local tourists from nearby cities aren’t enough to sustain the city’s economy. In order to keep the hotels filled throughout the week, he and his team must find a way to encourage foreign tourists to come back. Although some marque hotels such as Los Flamingos and the newly renovated,   Boca Chica hotel continue to enjoy a steady stream of visitors, other establishments, such as the massive old Hotel Mirador, have been hit harder by the outbreak of violent crime. The Mirador sits just up the road from Playa Angosta on the day of the double homicide there, a throng of tourists gathered on the elevated pavement to gawk down at the crime scene and the crowd of police and soldiers who came to secure the perimeter. A few Mexican tourists by the water’s edge didn’t even get up from their beach chairs. The violence does have an impact on foreign tourism, and for hotels like the Mirador, that’s a problem. Melchor Gonzalez, its    manager, stops to think if he is currently hosting even one guest from the US: “Right now, today, let me see   …     I don’t think I have one,” he says. “Today Acapulco is mostly national [Mexican] tourism. Foreign tourism still isn’t recovering. ” The occupancy of the Mirador’s famous restaurant, La Perla  —   the best place for viewing Acapulco’s famous cliff divers  —   depends on the overall health of the city’s tourist economy. “Now the biggest problem we have is crime. It’s affected us a lot in terms of occupancy,” Gonzalez says. “If Acapulco’s tourism is down, if occupancy is down, then the clientele in the [restaurant] goes down. ” During the worst weeks of 2014  —   following the abduction of the students in Ayotzinapa  —   hotel occupancy in Acapulco fell to 27%. This year, the hotel has frequently been nearly empty, and most of Gonzalez’s staff work just three days a week to cater for weekend visitors  —   yet he hopes Acapulco’s worst days are behind it. “It’s not recovered totally, but the port has recovered a lot,” he says.  Gonzalez believes Acapulco is facing a paradox, however. The economy won’t recover until the tourism economy rebounds, but the heavy police presence in the city may also be scaring off some foreign tourists. “People who know the problems of Acapulco see the police and feel safe  —   but foreign tourists can see it and think we still have serious problems. ” The potentially undermining effect of the heavy police presence isn’t lost on the mayor. Inside his office, he takes a brief pause from a long series of meetings to glance over the day’s newspapers  —   despairing at the headlines and   photos of police officers in combat gear. “Pinche guerra,” he curses (loosely translated as “  war”). Velázquez can’t escape the fact that Acapulco’s tourist economy is caught up in the state’s broader security dynamic. He says the soldiers are there to make people feel safe: “It generates a negative perception about security, but the presence of police and soldiers guarantees security on the streets. ” The mayor’s challenge is to find a way to restore Acapulco’s image abroad while the rest of his state continues to suffer from   problems stemming from   and crime. His success will depend on his skills as a salesman and his knack for marketing. When working a crowd, Velázquez is impressive  —   pulling in friends and associates for   bear hugs, and greeting the public with warm handshakes. In private, however, he’s pensive. He ponders over public policy issues: street lights for   areas, renovation projects for coastal barrios, simple solutions to streamline existing operations.  Velázquez faces serious challenges, but he sees an orderly process for moving forward. The crime, he thinks, is based on the absence of job opportunities the solution is to find ways to boost tourism. So his main focus is not on battling gangs, but rather on finding ways to put people back to work. He devotes his attention to concrete goals such as sending work crews out to clean up waste around the bay. He negotiates directly with airlines and cruise companies to bring flights and ships into Acapulco. It’s a piecemeal programme, designed to improve the city in incremental ways. In the longer term, Acapulco will need to develop complementary industries, perhaps parlaying its base of   hospitality professionals into a new customer service sector, based in call centres. For the moment, however, Velázquez, whose current term of office ends in 2018, is focusing on filling hotels.  “If tourism works then the economy flourishes and the government has resources for managing public policies, for building infrastructure,” he says. “We’re renovating, rebuilding facades and painting historic residential neighbourhoods. ” One of his major projects is the completion of a new bus rapid transit system, which should vastly improve the city’s public transportation network. Another initiative involves painting   housing developments with brightly coloured murals.  On a micro scale, Velázquez can work to generate loyalty with visitors by greeting tourists and handing out coconuts, but winning back foreign visitors who book vacations online will require a more expansive, holistic approach. The mayor, though, is confident that Acapulco’s prospects are improving. Last year its hotels reported 90% occupancy for the December holiday season, and he is sure that 2016 will end with a steady stream of arrivals and a mix of Mexican and foreign tourists celebrating the New Year in Acapulco. “Acapulco is recovering its tourism,” Velázquez vows. “Little by little, we’re getting out of it. ” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion

How LGBT Pride marches spread around the world
LGBT campaigners will march through central London today on this year’s Pride parade. The demonstrations are usually held at the end of June, to mark the anniversary of the Stonewall demonstrations that erupted in New York in 1969. Manhattan hosted its first Pride parade the following year, and the idea quickly spread to other cities in North America. London’s first march was in 1972. Parades in the US and further afield will be particularly emotional this year, coming just a few weeks after a gunman killed 49 people in a gay nightclub in Orlando. New York Police Department Commissioner Bill Bratton has predicted the march on 26 June will be the biggest the city has ever seen. The parades are generally no longer controversial in the west, with senior politicians lending their support and often joining in. But the recent ban of Istanbul Pride shows how far many other countries have to go on LGBT rights. Authorities have banned Pride marches in the Russian capital until 2112, while parades in recent years Montenegro and Serbia have been met with violence. Last August some brave souls also marched in Entebbe, Uganda. The country only annulled a law punishing homosexual acts with life sentences in 2014, and attempts to legislate against gay people continue.  Methodology: The graphic lists the first major gay pride parade or equivalent LGBTQ demonstration (eg Christopher Street Day) we could find in each of the countries listed in the table. Not all marches are still happening, with some having been latterly banned or cancelled.

Jürgen Klopp, José Mourinho and the cultivation of liderazgo
José Mourinho is only four years older than Jürgen Klopp but in football terms it can feel as though there is a lifetime between them. In part it is an issue of tactics: the hard, high press of which Klopp is such a devotee is modish. When Liverpool and Manchester City went to Tottenham this season and engaged in breathless, percussive styles, it felt like the football of today, the freshest ideas being pitched against each other. Mourinho’s style is more conventional. That does not render it invalid but, with the two managers’ sides poised to meet at Anfield on Monday night, it is part of a general sense of familiarity about the Manchester United manager that may be damaging. The great Argentinian coach Carlos Bianchi, who won four Copa Libertadores with Vélez Sarsfield and Boca Juniors, once laid out 10 “unwritten rules” of successful coaching for the magazine Management Deportivo. Not a single one of them referred to   strategy. For him the most important thing was to cultivate “el liderazgo”. The term literally means “leadership” but for Bianchi it was more than that  —   it was about developing a cult of personality. It is a strategy at least partially shared by Mourinho and Klopp. Klopp is warm and charismatic. To see him celebrating on the pitch after the   win at Stamford Bridge this season was to see a manager who is clearly loved both by his players and by the vast majority of Liverpool fans. His antics on the touchline, his obvious involvement in the game, make clear he is one of them. His manner in press conferences and interviews is convivial but there is a structure to his spontaneity. Watch him do a line of television interviews and you realise even the exclamations of “Ha!” are to an extent  . That is not to accuse him of hypocrisy or to suggest there is anything dishonest about his public persona but it is a performance geared to making certain points and achieving a certain effect. Talk to anybody who played for Mourinho at Porto and it can feel like talking to members of a cult. There is affection but also awe. “He knew everybody so deeply that he could control our emotions in every situation,” said the goalkeeper Vítor Baía, who described how Mourinho’s planning was so precise that at times it seemed as though he could foretell the future. In issue eight of The Blizzard, Roy Henderson outlined how closely Mourinho conforms to German political theorist Max Weber’s definition of the “charismatic authority” needed by demagogues. The line about being a “Special One” is a case in point: he knew the media would pick it up and that it added to the image he wanted to present of   and control. For managers who rely on el liderazgo, the problem comes when the aura is punctured. As the former Benfica coach Béla Guttmann once observed, a coach is like a  : “The moment he becomes unsure of his hypnotic energy, and the first hint of fear appears in his eyes, he is lost. ” This season Mourinho, rumpled and grouchy, has at times seemed hesitant, bereft of the ruthlessness of old. Worse, when he has been ruthless, as he was in his treatment of Bastian Schweinsteiger, it felt like a trick. There is resignation rather than shock: Mourinho doing his thing again. His interviews and press conferences no longer have the same impact: the same strategies recur and rather than report the outrage they are designed to provoke, the media now focus on the strategy. The demand for constant evolution is wearying. Very few managers manage more than a decade at the very highest level and those who do often have a fallow period  —   as, for instance, Sir Alex Ferguson did between 2003 and 2006. Mourinho is a coach of extraordinary gifts. He may find a way back to the top as he did, exhaustingly and self‑destructively, in Madrid by beating Barcelona to La Liga title in 2012. But at the moment it feels as though the momentum is against the Portuguese and, for a coach whose method is so based on perception, that is a major concern. Last season, although United got the better of Liverpool in both league games, there was a sense that Klopp represented modernity and Louis van Gaal something more traditional. One was vertical, the other horizontal, the difference between the two demonstrated as a rampant Liverpool beat United   in the home leg of their Europa League tie. There is little sense that anything has changed this season. United may be less conservative than they were under Van Gaal but they still seem sluggish by comparison with City, Spurs or Liverpool. Perhaps that is, as Mourinho has claimed, simply a case of him having to   players encumbered by Van Gaal’s indoctrination (resistant as they seemed to his philosophy at the time). But stylistically, since his first spell at Chelsea at least, Mourinho has stood alone, a brooding breakwater against the    tide. And that, too, may count against his el liderazgo: when the image of leadership is paramount, style and substance, reputation and actuality, go hand in hand. There was a time when Mourinho’s talk of resting with the ball, of transitions and midfield triangles seemed thrillingly new. He was the iconoclastic pioneer of a new age. But football has moved on. Klopp is modernity and that inflates his image. Mourinho, dulled by familiarity, is in danger of becoming the past.

Why I came to America: chasing my dream – and the man I loved
I never yearned to come to America, never wanted to be an immigrant. In the   I had a thriving, even glamorous, job in Bangalore, working for the Indian outpost of one of world’s largest advertising agencies. I also had a father who at 57 had become ill to the point of being bedridden and had to give up his beloved career in journalism.   One morning my boss introduced me to a new colleague from America. He was a tall, skinny guy with unruly hair. He was going to be on my creative team. I remember asking my boss: “What’s with the accent?” I got over my irritation with the new guy’s blurred R’s, and over the next few months we became friends. I mostly slept through the German experimental films he liked to watch and he’d groan at the Bollywood extravaganzas I preferred. We took up  . We joined dancing classes where I bit my lip not to laugh at the sight of my slim friend being flung around the floor by our enormous,   teacher to the strains of Eddie Rabbit’s I Love a Rainy Night. For more than a year after we met, we were just close friends. Then, before I knew it, we were in love. I knew he would go back to his country at some point, that much was certain. So for us there was only the here and now. Even when we started dating we didn’t talk about the future  —   there wasn’t one for us, so what was the point? But then, during one of our many confessionals, I told him my secret. I had always wanted to be a writer. One summer he went back to America and came back with application materials to graduate programs. “You should take the GRE, I can coach you on the math,” he said. Now the man I loved was doing everything he could to help me leave India and him. I applied for a full teaching fellowship to Temple University and got in.  At JFK the visa officer noticed that my visa was from Temple in Philadelphia. “Welcome to the murder capital of the east,” he welcomed me. Nowadays students coming from India have readymade networks, contacts who are ready to help set up roommates and relatives eager to supply food and advice. That night in 1997 however, as the lights of the van that dropped me off on campus disappeared into the dark, I remember thinking: “I don’t know a single soul in this country. ”  The country didn’t know me either  —   I was the only foreigner in my writing program. I got the usual questions: “Did you learn to speak English after you got here?” This in September, after I had told my questioner I had arrived in August. Those first months I couldn’t sleep. I was so lonely that one day I called up my  ’s father in Houston, someone I had never met or spoken to, just to hear a familiar language, an Indian accent.  Still, I had professors who were generous and cared about my work, and I loved walking into a classroom and arguing about American values with students from Korea or Armenia  —   countries that until then were just meaningless points on a map. America let me be in startup mode, create an    life for myself. In those first years I loved the country with all the blind loyalty and fierce gratitude of a new immigrant. Nowadays, my emotions for the country have matured  —   I accept its faults, understand its imperfections and love it anyway.   Phone calls were expensive in the 90s, so the two of us wrote each other letters, fat ones. We were back in   mode. There was no talk of love, no plans to discuss. Then in 1998, three semesters after I had moved to the US, my friend returned from India and abruptly moved to New York City, a   bus ride away. When my father died that December, he was the first person I called and he showed up at my dorm a few hours later.  We were married in 2000. He became a journalist, and in 2006 I became a citizen. We followed our lawyer’s advice and took our    daughter and my first book to the final hearing. Our child, the lawyer reasoned, was proof that we were a legitimate couple. As for the book, it would tell the government that I was worthy. I often think of that moment. Of how fitting it was that the day I became an American I had with me the two things that brought me here: my writing, and the man I loved.

The battle for Mosul in maps
In June 2014, when the leader of Isis, Abu Bakr   declared a global caliphate, he did it from Mosul, Iraq’s second city. Isis rapidly expanded its territory in Iraq and Syria throughout that year, but has since been gradually pushed back, partly due to   airstrikes. Losing Mosul now could spell the end of the jihadi group’s ability to control large swaths of Iraq.  The   operation to take back Mosul began on 16 October, involving a coalition of more than 30, 000 troops drawn from Iraqi army forces, Kurdish peshmerga fighters and Shia militias, supported by airstrikes from a   coalition. Turkish forces are also involved despite Iraqi government opposition. Around 6, 000 Isis fighters could be holed up in the city among more than a million civilians. It was agreed that only the Iraqi army would enter Mosul, due to fears its mainly Sunni inhabitants would see the Kurdish and Shia forces as too partisan.  After one week, progress was made to the north, south and east of Mosul despite Isis using a variety of defensive tactics. Advancing forces faced roadside bombs,   snipers, fleets of suicide car bombs and oil fire haze. The jihadis also launched diversionary attacks, most significantly in Kirkuk. It was also reported that Isis fighters were forcing people from the countryside into the city to use as human shields. Most progress was made east of the city, where Iraqi forces took the baton from the peshmerga who overwhelmed several villages in the first few days of fighting. A southern push by Iraqi army troops and Shia militias lagged behind the   eastern axis. Iraqi special forces reached Mosul’s eastern edge on 31 October after just over two weeks of fighting along the main Irbil road. Footholds were established in districts such as Gogjali and Karama before the westward offensive resumed on 4 November in the face of heavy Isis resistance. Advancing troops are expected to face a brutal street fight in heavily mined terrain, with   bridges and Isis fighters concealed in tunnels. This may yet extend the operation’s length to the months forecast in many initial estimates.   forces have effectively surrounded Mosul after more than six weeks of fighting but most observers expect the battle to last into 2017. The only Iraqi units inside the city are making slow progress in eastern districts, where Isis forces are fighting hard in areas where large numbers of civilians are still present. About 70, 000 refugees are living in camps mainly to the   of Mosul but their numbers could swell if conditions deteriorate further inside the city. Fighting has cut off water supplies for about 650, 000 people and the UN has said a   situation is developing. Food supplies have dwindled since Shia militia cut off the main corridor to Isis territory in Syria but the Iraqi government has discouraged them from taking the strategic town of Tel Afar, which may have raised sectarian tensions with its mainly Turkoman residents. A pincer movement by the Iraqi government’s   service is aiming to clear Isis fighters from the east bank of the Tigris. Elite CTS forces seized control of the large Mosul University complex, which Isis fighters used as a base, on 15 January. Meanwhile, other units have pushed north along the river after establishing their first bridgehead on 8 January. The offensive was effectively relaunched at the end of 2016 when troops from other positions were redeployed, along with US special forces, to bolster the main lines of attack in east Mosul. This enabled the CTS to advance after struggling for weeks to move beyond suburbs reached earlier in the operation. Iraqi forces now control the eastern side of three bridges over the Tigris but none are currently operational. All river crossings were partially destroyed by   airstrikes aimed at hampering Isis logistics but will now need repairing for an assault on the densely populated west bank where heavy Isis resistance and several more months of fighting likely awaits.  Iraqi government forces took control of most of Mosul airport on 23 February, meeting their first key objective for retaking the western half of the city from Isis. The operation was launched on 19 February several weeks after Iraqi forces established complete control of eastern Mosul. Isis fighters sabotaged the runway last year but Iraqi forces will use the large site as a base to push north into residential districts and towards symbolic locations such as Mosul’s great mosque. A difficult fight is expected in these densely populated,   areas where tanks and armoured vehicles will be unable to operate and Isis is likely to use human shields and deploy ambushes and suicide bombers.  Up to 750, 000 civilians may still be trapped inside west Mosul, with fuel and food supplies dwindling and drinking water and electricity scarce. The UN says about 160, 000 civilians have been displaced since the battle for Mosul began in October and aid organisations are preparing for another exodus as the offensive enters its latest stage. 31 March 2017: Most of the centre of west Mosul remains under Isis control after a deadly airstrike by the   coalition highlighted the difficulty of fighting in densely populated areas. Iraqi military leaders were forced to temporarily halt operations amid international condemnation of the raid, which killed at least 150 people in the frontline district of Mosul Jadida on 17 March. Isis fighters are said to have encouraged people to take shelter in three buildings that were then destroyed by coalition aircraft. Such jihadi tactics are likely to continue as Iraqi forces converge through populous neighbourhoods towards the symbolic Grand Nuri mosque where Isis declared its caliphate in 2014.  The   push into Mosul’s western districts began with the capture of Mosul airport in February. Iraqi units moving north along the Tigris river made key gains on 7 March by capturing Mosul’s municipal centre, central bank and museum. An advance to the west of the old city that eventually captured Mosul Jadida has now resumed as investigations continue into the 17 March airstrike. The   Great Mosque of   was blown up as Iraqi forces continued a concerted assault on remaining Isis positions in the old city. The mosque’s renowned leaning minaret, which was a highly visible and hugely symbolic target for advancing Iraqi forces, abruptly disappeared from the city’s skyline after more than eight hundred years. Footage suggested it had been destroyed by explosives deliberately placed at its base. The US military denied Isis claims it had hit it in an airstrike. The significance of the mosque to Isis was that it was where its leader Abu Bakr   had in June 2014 declared a “caliphate”. The Iraqi prime minister, Haider   said its destruction was now a “declaration of their defeat”. But such an outcome may yet be weeks away given the months of arduous   required to reduce Isis’s control to a small portion of the old city and their ranks to 300 militants, compared with almost 6, 000 at the start of the offensive in October.

For real progressives, Jill Stein is now the only choice
The stakes of Wednesday night’s CNN Green party town hall were high  —     candidates are rarely allowed entry into the corporate media universe, which thrives on the false narrative that only two parties exist here in the United States. This was perhaps the only opportunity the presidential candidate I have endorsed  —   Jill Stein  —   and her running mate, Ajamu Baraka, to have the ear of a large portion of the mainstream American electorate. There was little room for error. They spent little time directly criticizing Donald Trump. This was a wise move, since virtually no one among Stein’s potential base of support is considering Trump as a viable option. Instead, she focused on Hillary Clinton.  At a moment where the Clinton campaign is still attempting to secure the support of frustrated Bernie Sanders primary voters, Stein demonstrated that Clinton’s brand of liberalism does not represent the tone or spirit of the Sanders campaign. By highlighting Clinton’s   politics and active role in hawkish foreign policy, Stein raised considerable doubt about Clinton’s leftist bona fides. “I will have trouble sleeping at night if Donald Trump is elected,” Stein said. “I will also have trouble sleeping at night if Hillary Clinton is elected. ” Throughout the event, both Stein and Baraka rightly refuted the idea that superficial identity politics are enough to constitute a progressive movement. Stein destroyed the notion that a vote for Clinton is a feminist move, as Clinton’s   stances and neoliberal economic policies have compromised the lives and prosperity of women and families around the globe. Baraka drew from Barack Obama’s presidential record to show that electing a black president has not signaled a turn away from   racism at the systemic or interpersonal levels. Stein also raised doubts about Clinton’s trustworthiness. While these arguments are not new, they carried a different level of veracity when separated from the hypocritical and sexist “crooked Hillary” rhetoric of the Trump campaign. Drawing from Clinton’s own   playbook, Stein used Clinton’s email scandal and missteps abroad as a springboard to question Clinton’s judgment.  Of course, such critiques would have been more effective if the possibility of a nuclear armed Trump weren’t lingering in the back of voter’s minds, but they nonetheless focused appropriate scrutiny to the secretary’s actions. But Stein and Baraka did not merely tell voters what to vote against, they also gave them something to vote for. Throughout the night, the candidates used their time to articulate the Green party’s vision for the future. Specifically, Stein talked about workable plans to create peace in the Middle East, a plan that includes nuclear disarmament, a call to end the Israeli occupation of Palestine and a loosening of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and World Trade Organization’s economic strangleholds on the globe’s most vulnerable nations.  Baraka offered a workable vision of a nation without state violence, inner cities without police as occupying forces and vulnerable citizens not viewed as enemy combatants. For the first time since Bernie Sanders stepped out of the Democratic race, the American public was given an opportunity to dream out loud for a few hours about freedom, justice and true democracy. Despite the town hall’s success, the Green party has a long way to go to snag a significant slice of undecided, Independent and   voters. The challenge of the   campaign will be to convince voters of a   political vision, one that isn’t prisoner to our collective obsession with individual elections or hyperbolic fear of particular candidates.  They will have to persuade voters to believe that the   system, when underwritten by endless corporate money, does not offer the “lesser of two evils” but a fundamental threat to democracy itself. Surely, they have a long way to go to achieve these goals. But they’ve made an incredible start.

Michael Phelps’ ’death stare’: US swim star unimpressed by rival’s antics
The rivalry between swimmers Michael Phelps and Chad Le Clos continued on Monday, as a tense exchange before their 200m butterfly   was caught on camera. In the ready room before the race, Le Clos decided to start shadowboxing in front of Phelps  —   and the   Olympic gold medalist was not impressed. Under his hood, with his trademark headphones on, Phelps stared down his   rival  —   and NBC Sports caught the exchange on camera. The sight of Phelps grilling Le Clos created a raft of new memes. Some compared Phelps to Darth Vader and Eminem.  Phelps beat Le Clos in their heat, but Hungary’s Tamas Kenderesi was quickest overall. Afterwards, NBC’s Michele Tafoya asked Phelps what he was thinking as he glared at Le Clos. “Nothing, honestly  —   I was trying not to really even look at him,” he said. “He does his thing, I do my thing. I was watching the heat in front of me. ” At London 2012, Phelps equalled the record of Russian gymnast Larisa Latynina by winning his 18th Olympic medal in the 200m butterfly. However, Phelps could only manage silver: the then    Le Clos beat the American to take the gold. It was the first time Phelps had lost in a 200m butterfly event since 2001. Last year, the South African was offended by comments Phelps made about the lack of speed in the sport. After winning the 100m butterfly at the 2015 world championships, Le Clos told Eurosport: “I just did a [100m butterfly] time that [Phelps] hasn’t done in four years, so he can keep quiet now. ” Phelps beat Le Clos’s time a few days later. Afterwards he told reporters: “[Le Clos’s] comments were interesting,” Phelps said. “It just fuels me. If you want to do it, go for it. I welcome it. ” The two are set to square off in the 200m butterfly final on Tuesday night.

José Mourinho: United’s jealous rivals could never have done Paul Pogba deal
José Mourinho has had another dig at Arsène Wenger and Jürgen Klopp, suggesting they are not at clubs big enough to make a signing like Manchester United’s   £89m capture of Paul Pogba. Last Friday the United manager branded his counterparts from Arsenal and Liverpool “not ethical” after they questioned the fee his club were reportedly set to spend on bringing Pogba back from Juventus. And following United’s announcement in the early hours of Tuesday morning that the Pogba deal was officially done, Mourinho told MUTV: “I know the discussion, I understand that, sometimes in football, things happen and the club breaks the record, but this is only possible at clubs like Man United. “When I heard some of the comments and heard some of the managers criticising that, I don’t think they ever have this problem because, to have this problem, you need to be at one of the top clubs in the world. So at Man United it can happen. ” While Mourinho feels the “unbelievable” Pogba “has everything” he has stressed it may take time before the    France international is fully firing in the United side and has vowed to protect him if needed. “He’s a very young player, an unbelievable midfield player with such physicality but, at the same time, such agility, coordination, skill. He has everything,” he said. “What he has to learn now is how to play with us because I always say that in football you can be a super player, like he is, but a team is a team and you need to learn how to play in the team, and the team needs to learn how to play with you. We need to get the best out of him and this will be a process. So if he needs protection, I am here to protect. “I know some people think that he arrives here now and, the first time he touches the ball, he scores, but I’m here to protect him and give him the best conditions to be what we think he is going to be, which is a football player for Man United, a reference for this club. I’m so happy. ” Four years after leaving the club for Juve, Pogba has returned to United as one of the biggest stars in the game. Asked if the player seemed happy to be back in Manchester, Mourinho replied: “I can feel that when I speak with him for the first time. I’m feeling now when I see him at the training ground with people he knows since he was a kid. He doesn’t look like a star. He looks like a kid who is back to his old school and is finding people that he cares about and people that love him a lot. “So I believe that, after a couple of days, he will feel like he never left the club. So I think at adaptation level, he’s not a new player  —   he’s just a kid back home again. ” Mourinho  —   who has also signed Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Henrikh Mkhitarayan and Eric Bailly following his appointment in May  —   added that he is happy with his squad. “It’s the first time I’ve worked with such a number of players because I’m used to working with 20 plus the keepers, and we have in the squad 23 plus the keepers. So we had to make decisions and let some players go on loan, and try to sell others,” he said. A source at the club told the Guardian that there had been “lots of enquiries” about the German midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, who has been training with the reserve squad, and that Adnan Januzaj would be allowed to spend the season on loan, with the former United manager David Moyes interested in bringing him to Sunderland. Juan Mata, sold by Chelsea while Mourinho was in charge there and substituted in Sunday’s Community Shield just 26 minutes after coming on as a substitute himself, is however likely to stay in Manchester. “This group of 23 is a great group and I think in this moment  —   and I told them this  —   there is a little bit of frustration for the ones that I have not selected. They work hard to be in the match and they aren’t, and this is going to happen in the next two or three weeks because we have just one Premier League match. “But, in September, the Capital One Cup starts, the Europa League starts, we start playing three matches a week and then everybody is involved and the squad is good. The empathy between the guys is really good too, so I’m happy with the squad. ”

Why I Hate the Internet found so many readers
Among the poetry racks on the second floor of San Francisco’s legendary City Lights bookstore, an audience member is confronting the author Jarett Kobek with a spirited defense of the revolutionary power of Twitter and Bernie Sanders. His harangue, delivered during a book reading in February, was in atavistic beatnik dialect. “I do Tweet about it, Jack!” he shouted, stirring an erstwhile polite audience to shout things like “Sit the fuck down!” and “Let him talk!” It’s hard to imagine a more appropriate reception for Kobek’s second novel, I Hate the Internet, a savage satire of internet culture set in 2013 San Francisco.. It centers on the fallout from a surreptitious recording posted to Youtube, its narrator describing   events of the city rendered in the hyperbolic language that has come to represent online interactions, and diverging into   invective to expose its “ intolerable bullshit”. More funny than obnoxious, the novel has become a sleeper sensation  —   a more or less   book that landed a favorable review above the fold on the front page of the New York Times’ arts section (something Kobek believes is a first for a   book). It has dipped into the Amazon top 500, and appears set for a wider international release in six languages. San Francisco’s independent bookstores, pinched for years by online competition and soaring commercial rents pushed up by the city’s tech boom, have pushed the book hard. “With this cover, I think the book would have sold OK even if the pages were blank,” says Kobek. It’s easily spotted on the city’s buses and in its parks, wielded as a talisman against the epidemic of smartphones. But the reception has exceeded his rosiest expectations. “The ironic thing, of course, is that this has all mostly happened on the internet,” said Kobek, 38, of his book’s unlikely success. His shaved head is glinting in the afternoon light of a dingy cafe in San Francisco’s North Beach. He points to a photograph of American Psycho author Bret Easton Ellis reading his book in bed, and a mention on music site Pitchfork as catalysts for the book’s surge in sales. Sales on Amazon, both digital and paperback, and attention from the New York Times are laden with irony. The novel describes them respectively as “an unprofitable website dedicated to the destruction of the publishing industry,” and “transitioning from America’s paper of record into a website that catered to the perceived whims of affluent, youthful demographics. ”  Over the course of the novel, its author gradually reveals an ambivalence towards the internet belied by its stark title. Early on Kobek writes: “This bad novel, which is a morality tale about the internet, was written on a computer. You are suffering the moral outrage of a hypocritical writer who has profited from the spoils of slavery. ” Later, during a long   soliloquy by a   character, a scene which openly parodies the climax of Ayn Rand’s libertarian novel Atlas Shrugged, the reader learns: “I know what the internet was like before people used it to make money. I am the only literary writer in America with a serious tech background! I am the only literary writer in America who ran Slackware 1. 0 on his 386x!” Kobek admits that his experiences both using technology and working for tech firms have been formative . “The internet is as much a part of me as anything,” he says. “I’ve done just about every     job the internet has to offer, from web design to systems admin. I was a big Unix guy at one point, in my late teens.  “But my relationship with it started divorcing around the time social media started. Really the book could be called ‘I hate four companies and social media’  —   but that is a bad title. ” What the book taps, says Kobek, is a visceral emotional impulse he encountered frequently on his   national book tour, its ranting tone and merciless humor attempting to offset a feeling of powerlessness commonly felt by internet users The book defines this as “intellectual feudalism produced by technological innovation arriving in the disguise of culture”. Kobek blazes with brutal rhetoric, but described the narrator’s desperate attempt to understand an impossibly complex and fluid situation. “I knew people hated the internet,” he said, “but I didn’t realize how deeply wounded people are by it. Everyone knows someone who’s had just horrible experiences. It’s been exhausting, at times it has felt like group therapy,” he said of his recent book tour . Kobek lived in San Francisco from 2009 through 2014 before decamping to Los Angeles. “The preparation was, unfortunately, being tortured by San Francisco for four years,” says Kobek . “When I come back now, I just feel overwhelmingly sad. As much as I shit on it, San Francisco has enormous charm. But it’s like a city with Alzheimer’s, it still looks the same but there is something missing. ” He writes of the city with wrath. “San Francisco had two distinctions: One, it was the most beautiful city in America. Two, it was filled with the most annoying people in America. It had always been like this, from the beginning. The merit of any moment in San Francisco could be measured by a simple question: was the beauty of the city outweighing its annoying citizens?”  But the success of Kobek’s bleak book is a story of hope and entrepreneurial pluck. Stymied in his early attempts to get it published, he   a small press in Los Angeles called We Heard You Like Books, designing the cover and writing the Kindle and Nook files himself. He even created a prequel in the form of “an agitprop video game” cassette for beloved British microcomputer the ZX Spectrum. The book will be released in the UK this fall by Serpent’s Tail, and in Germany by Fischer Verlag. His next book, which takes up with the same characters during in an earlier era in New York City, has been sold to Viking. In I Hate the Internet, Kobek identifies with the tragic experience of comic book artist Jack Kirby, who created Captain America and many other superheroes but never financially benefitted from the business that he helped build. “The internet, and the multinational conglomerates which rule it, have reduced everyone to the worst possible fate. We have become nothing more than comic book artists, churning out content for enormous monoliths that refuse to pay us the value of our work. ” With this novel, Kobek seems to have found a way to make sure that doesn’t happen to him “As long as you have something to sell,” he says, “they can’t really hurt you. ”

US Federal Reserve expected to keep interest rates on hold
Financial markets have become over reliant on central banks, a leading international body said on Sunday, as investors prepared for the latest announcement on interest rates from the US Federal Reserve. The Bank for International Settlements, known as the central bankers’ bank, said in its latest quarterly bulletin that the institutions had become   with the responsibility for tackling a slowdown in growth. The comments from the the   BIS came at the start of a week when the Fed and the Japanese central bank both prepare to update the markets on their latest interest policies. The Fed is expected to keep interest rates on hold, despite concerns that the strength of the world’s largest economy warrants a rise in borrowing costs. Analysts on Wall Street said there was little likelihood of an interest rate rise when Fed officials meet on Wednesday, saying there was only a 12% chance of a hike from the current 0. 5% rate. Forecasts of a rate rise in September were downgraded following a 1. 1% rise in annual inflation reported in August, up from 0. 8% in July. Analysts said the rise in prices was unlikely to have much influence on the Fed, because it was mostly the result of the biggest jump in health costs for 32 years and a modest increase in housing rents, while food and consumer goods prices remained flat. A decision to freeze rates would bring the Fed into line with the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, which both kept interest rates at historic lows at their September meetings. As the focus turns to the Fed and the Bank of Japan, which could add further stimulus to its already broad package of measures to cut the cost of credit, Claudio Borio, the head of the BIS’s monetary and economic department, said at the launch of the quarterly bulletin: “It is becoming increasingly evident that central banks have been overburdened for far too long”. The bulletin outlined how markets had responded since the UK’s vote in June to leave the EU, which prompted the Bank of England to cut rates for the first time in more than seven years to 0. 25%. “Through a combination of near zero, or even negative, policy rates,   asset purchases and forward guidance, central banks have been seeking to ease financial conditions in order to boost the economy and, above all, to bring inflation up closer to their numerical objectives,” Borio said. “Developments in the period under review have highlighted once more just how dependent on central banks markets have become,” he said. Borio also cautioned about their role in the BIS annual report in June.  The Fed, which raised rates from their crisis level of near zero in December 2015, now seems likely to raise rates in December, according to a poll of analysts. It is under pressure to do so from savers who have spent the last eight years locked into zero interest accounts, and from regulators concerned that low interest rates are driving investors to speculate on the world’s stock markets.  The Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, has complained that low interests rates are denying savers a return on their pension funds and fostering a speculative stock market bubble.  Marc Ostwald, a strategist at ADM Investor Services International, said the timing of the presidential vote could override other concerns. “A September hike cannot be ruled out completely, above all given the fact that a November meeting hike looks to be off the table, given its proximity to the election,” he said. The prospect of an interest rate rise in the US has receded after the International Monetary Fund signalled that it would be revising down its July prediction of 3. 1% growth for this year when it publishes its World Economic Outlook next month.  Employment figures also showed that the US suffered a lull in job creation last month. There were 151, 000 jobs added to the US economy in August, below economists’ forecasts for 180, 000 and a marked slowdown after two bumper months of growth. The Fed has hinted at a rate rise before the end of this year. Its chair, Janet Yellen, said in May that she and fellow policymakers would watch the economic data closely. “It’s appropriate  —   and I have said this in the past, I think  —   for the Fed to gradually and cautiously increase our overnight interest rate over time,” she said. “Probably in the coming months such a move would be appropriate. ”

Amber Heard files for divorce from Johnny Depp
Johnny Depp’s wife has filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences after just over a year of marriage. Court records show that Amber Heard filed for divorce on Monday and is seeking spousal support from the   actor. The split also comes hard on the heels of the death on 20 May of Depp’s mother, Betty Sue Palmer, after a long illness. Depp and Heard recently hit the headlines for a bizarre spat with Australian deputy prime minister and minister for agriculture Barnaby Joyce, after Heard fell foul of biosecurity rules for unlawfully bringing the pair’s dogs into the country. Joyce threatened to have the dogs euthanised unless they “buggered off” back to the United States. Heard admitted making a false customs declaration, in exchange for which an Australian magistrate dropped charges against her of illegally importing animals, which carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. As part of the case, Depp and Heard were awkward participants in an extraordinary video, in which they offered an apology of staggering insincerity, and Depp mutters that people should “declare everything when you go to Australia”. Bernadette Callaghan, the magistrate, said at the time that the video was “of far more benefit to this country” as a warning to others than any conviction of Heard. Heard listed their date of separation as Sunday. The pair have no children together. Depp and Heard met when they   in the 2011 film The Rum Diary, and while Depp was still in a long relationship with the French actor, Vanessa Paradis.  Depp’s latest film, Alice Through the Looking Glass, is due to be released on Friday.  The divorce was first reported on Wednesday by celebrity website TMZ, who also reported that the couple do not have a   agreement.

Could Jill Stein’s vote recount change the outcome of the election?
In two days, Jill Stein raised more than enough money, more than $5m, to file for recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, though her campaign is still seeking about $2m more to cover the associated legal fees. Results in these battleground states were narrow, with Trump winning by just 0. 3% in Michigan, 1. 2% in Pennsylvania, and 0. 7% in Wisconsin. If Clinton had won all of these states’ 46 electoral college votes, it have would been enough for her to win the presidency. But the recount process is intensive, expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven. Experts have been skeptical that is the case.  In Wisconsin  —   where her team was due to file a recount motion by Friday afternoon  —   election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5% of votes cast on electronic   machines. Wisconsin election commission director Michael Haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount, though it had not seen evidence of interference in the state’s voting system. “We don’t have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with,” Haas said. Unofficial results showed Trump won Wisconsin by more than 27, 000 votes. The state has never conducted a presidential recount, but Stein’s campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on Friday before the deadline to do so in the state. In Pennsylvania, there is no paper trail  —   a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 November race. “The nightmare scenario would be if Pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close. You would have no paper records to do a recount,” Lawrence Norden, the   of a report on voting machines, told the Los Angeles Times in late October. But because machines there are not connected to the internet, like those in Michigan, officials said they couldn’t be hacked. Across the whole of the US, about   of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner, according to the nonpartisan group Verified Voting, which examines how new technology affects voting integrity. But some states, including Pennsylvania, rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail. The punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the Florida recount in 2000 are no longer used.  Trump was declared the winner in Michigan on Thursday by 10, 704 votes, and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking. “It’s just conjecture, and I don’t think that serves anyone’s good purpose,” said Chris Thomas, the longtime director of Michigan’s Bureau of Elections.

Leicester’s woes continue as Hazard, Costa and Moses fire Chelsea to victory
There was a moment just after the   here when frustration finally overcame Claudio Ranieri, prompting a comically exaggerated thumbs down as he spun on his heels in disgust on the edge of his technical area. His ire appeared to be directed at the referee, Andre Marriner, though he could have offered up the gesture to most of his side. The hangover from Leicester City’s title success is still pounding away. This was a fourth pointless game in succession on the champions’ travels and it should have ended as a defeat as emphatic as those already endured at Liverpool and Manchester United. What was such a tight unit last term, a side propelled as much by   as technical quality and tactical organisation, has fractured, with   creeping in. Maybe the prospect of having to heave themselves into another slog of a domestic campaign has diminished their hunger, particularly with the tantalising distraction of the Champions League. Perhaps they have just been found out. It cannot all be pinned on N’Golo Kanté’s departure to   London. A trio of   players had admittedly been rested with one eye on Tuesday’s visit of Copenhagen, when victory would maintain progress at the top of their group and bring the knockout phase within sight, but that did not excuse the slackness of so much of this display. Chelsea enjoyed a similar breeze against promoted Burnley back in August, the ease of their victory summed up by the substitute Nathaniel Chalobah’s neat backheel into Victor Moses’s pass 10 minutes from time that was finished emphatically by the right  . Antonio Conte’s team have made a habit of dispatching teams outside the division’s elite this term. Leicester currently fall into that bracket. The hosts had established their lead early, swarming all over limp opponents and swiftly exploiting a   fragility at  . This had felt a mismatch from the outset with Kasper Schmeichel overworked and increasingly exasperated by the manner that his backline wilted in front of him. Wes Morgan and Robert Huth, such rocks last term, were gripped by indecision and culpable for errors that set a troubling tone. Luis Hernández, secured under freedom of contract in the summer, looked out of his depth at   constantly bypassed by the interplay mustered by Marcos Alonso and Eden Hazard down the hosts’ left. Chelsea were irrepressible, but Leicester never hinted at resistance. Schmeichel had already done well to deny a deflected shot from Moses, such an aggressive presence off the right flank, but Leicester consider   delivery an invitation for disaster these days. Hazard’s delivery was duly flicked on by Nemanja Matic with the loose ball allowed to run on to Diego Costa, untracked by a static Morgan, at the far post. The striker rammed in the seventh goal of a productive campaign from close range. It was the kind of concession that would have been unthinkable only a few months ago, but it was the fifth goal shipped by this side at   already this term. No team has conceded more. The lack of concentration and confidence was startling. Panic had long since set in. Huth, booked for clattering Hazard, was fortunate to avoid dismissal after handling instinctively to choke another fluent Chelsea break. Within seconds Huth and Hernández, both hesitant, failed to cut out a   pass from Matic that a grounded Pedro Rodríguez hooked on for Hazard. The Belgian’s fortunate first touch took him away from Christian Fuchs and, having darted around Schmeichel, his finish was crisp and accurate. Throw in David Luiz’s   which thumped the top of the post, and the fact the visitors departed at the interval having been breached only twice actually felt a cause for moderate celebration. Dismantling the reigning champions would normally serve as a statement of intent at Chelsea, though this was all too easy. They could rejoice in Kanté’s busy presence, his every touched booed by the travelling support, with the Frenchman denied his first goal for his new club by Morgan’s desperate block. A midfield denied Willian and Oscar  —   both on compassionate leave back in Brazil  —   appeared to enjoy the leeway Conte’s    formation allowed them. Moses might have added a third after a blistering break from Kanté before the hour mark, a chance that had actually punctured a period of more persuasive Leicester pressure, but the Nigeria international would enjoy his own reward before the end. The closest Leicester came to a riposte was Luiz’s stretch to intercept Marc Albrighton’s centre, with the ball cannoning from the woodwork, but the visitors’ threat was only ever fitful. At present, their title defence is feeling forlorn.

French woman accused of murdering daughter on beach blames witchcraft
A French woman who left her baby daughter to drown on a beach blamed “witchcraft” when she went on trial for murder on Monday. Fabienne Kabou, 39, who was described as having “remarkable intelligence   …     but subject to irrational beliefs” travelled to    with her only child, Adélaïde, in November 2013. Kabou checked into a hotel and asked locals about the tides before reportedly breastfeeding the child on the beach that night and leaving her as the sea came in and temperatures dropped to below freezing. The girl’s body was discovered by a prawn fisherman the following day. Kabou told police she had chosen the town, on France’s Channel coast between Calais and Dieppe, because “even the name sounded sad”. Berck sounds like “yuck” in French. According to French press reports, Kabou told investigators she walked on to the beach in the moonlight. “I stopped at one point. She gave a small jump as if she’d just woken up. She was looking for my breast, I gave it to her. I remained standing and I clutched her against me and then, I don’t know, I said: ‘No, no, no.’ I couldn’t stop saying ‘no’ I don’t know why. I cried. It was as if I was saying to someone: ‘I can’t do something like that,’ but I did it. ” She continued: “I saw the spray and I must have left Ada at five metres, perhaps two. In any case, she would have drowned straight away. I don’t know how fast the tide came in but it was very close. I put her down, I spoke to her, I told her I was sorry. She was fine, I think. She didn’t feel in danger, I was next to her, on my knees. I gave her a long hug   …     she wasn’t exactly asleep but she was calm   …     I don’t know how long I stayed there, saying I was sorry, talking to her. Then I turned on my heels and I ran. ” The next day Kabou returned to Paris by train.  Kabou, of Senegalese origin, told the court of her   childhood in Dakar. She was described as a brilliant student. She is said to have an IQ of 130, well above average. She moved to France in 1995, where she abandoned an architecture course after two years and embarked on a philosophy degree. She also fell in love with a painter and sculptor 30 years her senior, Michel Lafon. She terminated two pregnancies before giving birth to Adélaïde alone at the art studio she shared with Lafon. She had not consulted a doctor during the pregnancy and neither parent registered the birth with the authorities, so there was no official record of Adélaïde, who was named after her grandmother.  Kabou told detectives she heard voices persecuting her and evil forces that drove her to kill her daughter.  “In 2011 I fell pregnant with Adélaïde, she was born in August and I ended up killing her 15 months after her birth,” she told the court in the   town of  .  “Witchcraft. That’s my default explanation because I have no other. ” Kabou said she had spent around €40, 000 consulting “witchdoctors and healers” before leaving the child to die on the beach. “Nothing makes sense in this story. What interest could I have I have in tormenting myself, lying, killing my daughter? I spoke of sorcery and I’m not joking. Even a stupid person would not do what I did. ” Kabou’s lawyer Fabienne   asked her to explain the evil forces she felt had driven her to kill. “For many years I struggled to wake up in the morning. My feet were paralysed. I had hallucinations, like seeing the walls that wouldn’t stop shaking,” Kabou said. Court psychiatrist Paul Bensussan said her act was possibly triggered to post natal depression. The father took no interest in the child, according to court documents. Kabou is on trial for premeditated murder and faces life in prison if convicted. The trial in   is expected to last a week.

Standing Rock: injured protester’s father says police account is ’bogus nonsense’
North Dakota law enforcement have blamed protesters for a woman’s grievous injury at the Dakota Access pipeline protests on Sunday, despite assertions from the woman’s father and a witness to the incident that she was hit by a police concussion grenade.  Sophia Wilansky, an environmental activist from New York, was hospitalized in Minneapolis where surgeons are attempting to repair a severe injury to her left arm that destroyed arteries, nerves, muscle, soft tissue and bone, according to her father. She remains at risk of amputation, and if the arm is salvaged, it will probably have very limited functionality.  Wayne Wilansky, her father, contends that the injury was caused by an exploding concussion grenade thrown by law enforcement, who also deployed teargas, rubber bullets and a water cannon on protesters during a tense standoff on a bridge Sunday night.  But North Dakota law enforcement officers have aggressively countered Wilansky’s account, releasing multiple statements accusing protesters of setting off an explosion. Lieutenant Tom Iverson of the North Dakota highway patrol said that two men and a woman were standing near a burned vehicle on the bridge around 3am when “it became obvious that they were tampering with the vehicle or planting a device”. The highway patrol said the explosion occurred after other protesters rolled “metallic cylinder objects” toward the three near the car, and that the female protester was pulled from under the vehicle before the group “fled the scene”.  The highway patrol also released photographs of propane cylinders recovered from the scene of the confrontation, which they said were being used as explosives. Wayne Wilansky, who was not in North Dakota at the time of his daughter’s injury, spoke to the Guardian from the hospital and conveyed his daughter’s account. He maintains that the police account was “completely fictitious” and “bogus nonsense”. “She wasn’t near the truck at the time it happened and was backing away while being shot with rubber bullets,” he said. “While backing away and trying not to be hit with the bullets the grenade was thrown directly at her and it exploded on her arm. ”  A witness, Stephen Joachinson, told the Guardian that he was talking with Sophia Wilansky near the burned vehicle when police started yelling at them on a bullhorn.  “They threatened that they were going to shoot us with    force and within 20 seconds of that warning they just started firing on us,” he said.  The pair began running away, he said, when a concussion grenade exploded behind them. Seconds later, a second concussion grenade struck her arm.  “When she got hit with the rubber bullet she was hurt and she was scared and she ran back, and that’s when they hit her with the concussion grenade and it blew up right on her arm,” Joachinson said.  A spokeswoman for the Morton County sheriff’s department told the Los Angeles Times that officers did not deploy any concussion grenades on Sunday. Officials have said that they deployed teargas,   rounds, sponge rounds and a water cannon.  Law enforcement officials did not respond to queries from the Guardian seeking a list of all the types of “  ” weapons used on Sunday, a list of all the law enforcement agencies present and further details on its statements about the incident.  “The injuries are inconsistent with any resources utilized by law enforcement and are not a direct result of any tools or weapons used by law enforcement,” Iverson said in a statement. Wayne Wilansky called law enforcement’s denial of using concussion grenades “nonsensical”.  “The doctor pulled shrapnel out of her arm,” he said, adding that surgeons had informed him that the injury was “entirely consistent” with a grenade explosion.  The Standing Rock Healer and Medical Council, a group of medical professionals at the encampments, also rejected the claim that the injury was caused by a propane explosion, citing witness accounts, the “lack of charring of flesh at the wound site” and “grenade pieces that have been removed from her arm in surgery”.  The explosion is under investigation by the North Dakota bureau of criminal investigation with support from the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Wilansky said that FBI officers had visited the hospital and collected his daughter’s clothing on Tuesday. A spokesman for the FBI refused to confirm or deny that the agency was involved in the investigation.  Sophia Wilansky is one of thousands of activists who have travelled to the banks of the Missouri river near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in North Dakota to support the tribe’s efforts to halt the Dakota Access pipeline. Members of the tribe fear that the pipeline  —   which is slated to cross under the river  —   will contaminate their water supply and object to construction on land that includes sacred burial sites. The movement has become a global rallying cry for indigenous rights and   change activism, but has faced fierce opposition from the pipeline company and local law enforcement. Morton County’s sheriffKyle Kirchmeier, said in a statement on Monday that the tribe had been “hijacked” by “violent factions” made up of “evil agitators”.  More than 500 people have been arrested during the   standoff, and law enforcement officials have deployed pepper spray, teargas, rubber bullets, Tasers, sound weapons and other “  ” methods.  The Mandan police chief, Jason Ziegler, said in a press conference on Monday that law enforcement agencies “can use whatever force necessary to maintain peace”.  Sara   contributed reporting

Lies, fearmongering and fables: that’s our democracy
What if democracy doesn’t work? What if it never has and never will? What if government of the people, by the people, for the people is a fairytale? What if it functions as a justifying myth for liars and charlatans? There are plenty of reasons to raise these questions. The lies, exaggerations and fearmongering on both sides of the Brexit   the xenophobic fables that informed the Hungarian referendum Donald Trump’s ability to shake off almost any scandal and exposure the election of Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, who gleefully compares himself to Hitler: are these isolated instances or do they reveal a systemic problem? Democracy for Realists, published earlier this year by the social science professors Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels, argues that the “folk theory of democracy”  —   the idea that citizens make coherent and intelligible policy decisions, on which governments then act  —   bears no relationship to how it really works. Or could ever work. Voters, they contend, can’t possibly live up to these expectations. Most are too busy with jobs and families and troubles of their own. When we do have time off, not many of us choose to spend it sifting competing claims about the fiscal implications of quantitative easing. Even when we do, we don’t behave as the theory suggests. Our folk theory of democracy is grounded in an Enlightenment notion of rational choice. This proposes that we make political decisions by seeking information, weighing the evidence and using it to choose good policies, then attempting to elect a government that will champion those policies. In doing so, we compete with other rational voters, and seek to reach the unpersuaded through reasoned debate. In reality, the research summarised by Achen and Bartels suggests, most people possess almost no useful information about policies and their implications, have little desire to improve their state of knowledge, and have a deep aversion to political disagreement. We base our political decisions on who we are rather than what we think. In other words, we act politically  —   not as individual, rational beings but as members of social groups, expressing a social identity. We seek out the political parties that seem to correspond best to our culture, with little regard to whether their policies support our interests. We remain loyal to political parties long after they have ceased to serve us. Of course, shifts do happen, sometimes as a result of extreme circumstances, sometimes because another party positions itself as a better guardian of a particular cultural identity. But they seldom involve a rational assessment of policy. The idea that parties are guided by policy decisions made by voters also seems to be a myth in reality, the parties make the policies and we fall into line. To minimise cognitive dissonance  —   the gulf between what we perceive and what we believe  —   we either adjust our views to those of our favoured party or avoid discovering what the party really stands for. This is how people end up voting against their interests. We are suckers for language. When surveys asked Americans whether the federal government was spending too little on “assistance to the poor” 65% agreed. But only 25% agreed that it was spending too little on “welfare”. In the approach to the 1991 Gulf war, nearly   of Americans said they were willing to “use military force” less than 30% were willing to “go to war”. Even the less ambitious notion of democracy  —   that it’s a means by which people punish or reward governments  —   turns out to be divorced from reality. We remember only the past few months of a government’s performance (a bias known as “duration neglect”) and are hopeless at correctly attributing blame. A great white shark that killed five people in July 1916 caused a 10% swing against Woodrow Wilson in the beach communities of New Jersey. In 2000, according to analysis by the authors 2. 8 million voters punished the Democrats for the floods and droughts that struck that year. Al Gore, they say, lost Arizona, Louisiana, Nevada, Florida, New Hampshire, Tennessee and Missouri as a result  —   which is ironic given his position on climate change. The obvious answer is better information and civic education. But this doesn’t work either. Moderately informed Republicans were more inclined than Republicans with the least information to believe that Bill Clinton oversaw an increase in the budget deficit (it declined massively). Why? Because, unlike the worst informed, they knew he was a Democrat. The tiny number of people with a very high level of political information tend to use it not to challenge their own opinions but to rationalise them. Political knowledge, Achen and Bartels argue, “enhances bias”. Direct democracy  —   referendums and citizens’ initiatives  —   seems to produce even worse results. In the US initiatives are repeatedly used by   lobby groups to achieve results that state legislatures won’t grant them. They tend to replace taxes with user fees, stymie the redistribution of wealth and degrade public services. Whether representative or direct, democracy comes to be owned by the elites. This is not to suggest that it has no virtues just that those it does have are not those we principally ascribe to it. It allows governments to be changed without bloodshed, limits terms in office, and ensures that the results of elections are widely accepted. Sometimes public attribution of blame will coincide with reality, which is why you don’t get famines in democracies. In these respects it beats dictatorship. But is this all it has to offer? A weakness of Democracy for Realists is that most of its examples are drawn from the US, and most of those are old. Had the authors examined popular education groups in Latin America, participatory budgets in Brazil and New York, the fragmentation of traditional parties in Europe and the movement that culminated in Bernie Sanders’ near miss, they might have discerned more room for hope. This is not to suggest that the folk theory of democracy comes close to reality anywhere, but that the situation is not as hopeless as they propose. Persistent, determined,   groups can bring neglected issues to the fore and change political outcomes. But in doing so they cannot rely on what democracy ought to be. We must see it for what it is. And that means understanding what we are.

Michael Bond: ‘I’m at my desk by 9am. I even write on Christmas Day’
I have been writing every day of my life, seven days a week, for almost 50 years. Even Christmas Day. But I still enjoy it. I have lived in the same house for the last 30 years and I have written in the same room ever since. When I first came to London, I went on a canal boat ride in Little Venice and I remember going past the street where I live now, thinking: “This must be a nice place to live. ” I never dreamed that I would one day live here. My writing room is a cosy,   room, with a dark wooden desk and a window overlooking the garden. There is a little Paddington bear watching over my desk. I am happy here, although on some days, there is rather a lot of traffic on the road and the river and it can be quite noisy. But I like looking out of the window while I write, watching all the activity. I am a city person and I get my inspiration from watching people. If I go for a short walk, I come back brimming with ideas. I think my mind has adapted to my work as a writer  —   I am constantly listening for little snatches of conversation. I’ve got ideas that made their way into books while on holiday, while shopping, while observing my grandson. Paddington has a lot of my father in him he was a very polite man and never left the house without a hat, so he could raise it when he met a lady. When he took me to the seaside as a child, he even kept his hat on while he was in the water. I am always at my desk by 9am. I use a laptop, which is usually buried under papers, and I have a typewriter, too. I like typewriters you can type with real flourish. One of the problems about working from home is it is so easy to do, so you end up working a lot. This is not a grumble, though, it is a fact of life. Paper is my problem. I have finished and unfinished stories all over the place. When I really want something  —   a particular page or a reference book  —   I can’t find it, so it doesn’t work incredibly well. I am running out of flat surfaces. It is ridiculous, really. And I am running out of space on my bookshelves  —   I have a lot of fat reference books everywhere and no space for anything new. I was brought up in a home where books were considered part of the furniture and I love reference books. But I tend to collect them  —   wine books, food books, books for my Monsieur Pamplemousse series  —   and only read them once. I have 95% of all I should ever want to know in my writing room. I went through a long, lovely period 30 years ago where I would go to a flat in Paris to do my writing. It was lovely because no one wrote to me. There were no disturbances and you could get a lovely meal in the evening. I’d get up early, switch on the machine and spend all the morning writing. While I wouldn’t want to write anywhere else than my home now, it’s not ideal because so many other things intrude. How long does it take me to write a book  —   how long is a piece of string? I am a quick writer, but in practical terms, I never continue to the next page until I am happy with the one I am writing. Goodness knows how many times I go over it. I don’t mind that though, it is a case of getting it right. I love working with illustrators. My current illustrator for the Paddington books lives in America and I like him terribly  —   any time I am not happy with something, I give him a call and he changes it immediately. You can have a funny relationship with illustrators because publishers don’t like you talking without them  —   it feels as if you’re going behind their back. I don’t think I’ve got faster at writing over the years. I think I am more skilled, though. Writing Paddington still comes very easily to me. I didn’t set out to write another, I was just exercising my mind and writing some ideas, until my agent said “You’ve got a book on your hands. ” I am very pleased with it. Paddington’s Finest Hour will be published in April by HarperCollins.

’Here we go!’ Guillermo del Toro begins filming The Shape of Water
  Guillermo del Toro seemed to be counting down the hours until he began filming his latest movie, The Shape of Water. “Here we go! Starting at 4 PM Toronto time. .. ” he tweeted. Production on the   film began Monday, a press release from Fox Searchlight Pictures announced. It will reportedly have a 2017 release date. The release vaguely described the film as “an   story, set against the backdrop of cold war era America circa 1963” and a “mysterious and magical journey”. In a profile of del Toro from earlier this month, the Guardian wrote that an “amphibious man forms a bond with a mortal woman” in the film. The Academy   del Toro will direct and   with Vanessa Taylor of Divergent and Game of Thrones fame. The film’s cast has been hailed as “insanely great” many of them Oscar nominees. It stars Sally Hawkins, of    and the recent Godzilla Richard Jenkins of The Visitor and Olive Kitteridge Boardwalk Empire actors Michael Shannon and Michael Stuhlbarg Octavia Spencer, of The Help and the Divergent Series and frequent Del Toro actor Doug Jones. None of their roles were specified in the release, though Del Toro told the Hollywood Reporter that Jones will play “the creature”. “My view of the creature is very personal. We have spent nine months creating and designing this creature, which is the longest time I’ve spent, ever, designing any creature, and I’m very much in awe of it,” he said. Among his palpable excitement for the film, judging from his tweets, Del Toro said he was excited to do a smaller budget film because of its increased freedom. “Since 1997 I haven’t had censorship problems at all. But with great budget comes great responsibility. This is the same scale, exactly, as Pan’s Labyrinth and I wanted to feel the same freedom where I could try to tell the story with whatever emotional logic I want to follow,” he told THR. It has been nearly a year since the release of Del Toro’s last film, Crimson Peak, making fans even more excited. He has directed and created the TV show The Strain in the meantime, and has a sequel to Pacific Rim in the works. He’s also bringing his children’s book Trollhunters to Netflix, while trying to get a musical of Pan’s Labyrinth off the ground. His collection of paintings and artwork is currently on display at LACMA.

Fox News is a cesspool of sexism. Firing Roger Ailes won’t fix that
This week, all signs point to Roger Ailes being fired from his position as head of Fox News. If ousted, it will be over sexual harassment claims  —   poetic justice at its very best. This is a man presiding over a network with a legendary disdain for women and women’s rights, taken down by a woman, Gretchen Carlson, who was the target of some of the worst of it. Carlson alleges, among other things, that Ailes told her, “You and I should have had a sexual relationship a long time ago, and then you’d be good and better and I’d be good and better. ” He said this, amazingly, in a meeting about sexual harassment. Carlson also claims that her contract wasn’t renewed as direct retaliation for complaining about the pervasive harassment and sexism she faced. And New York Magazine reported on Tuesday that Megyn Kelly says Ailes sexually harassed her as well, and that she’s told as much to Fox investigators. As more women come forward about Ailes  —   while others are perhaps unable to because of   clauses in their employment contracts  —   the likelihood of his “resignation” increases. (Fox News denies a decision has been made.) But removing one lascivious man can’t turn around the mess of misogyny that is Fox News. This is a network that bans its female   talent from wearing pants, where a host characterized a military operation against Isis led by a woman as “boobs on the ground” and the ethos of the coverage is shockingly antagonistic to women’s rights. There was the time, for example, that Fox contributor Erik Erickson said that men should be “dominant” over women in families. Or when an   panel bemoaned the rise of female breadwinners in the United States. Or when a host wondered if there was something about the female brain that was a “deterrent” to being a business executive. Or, my personal favorite, when Andrea Tantaros suggested that a female high school teacher who sexually abused a student did so because of   …     feminism. Oh, and these are just incidents from one year at the network.  I have no doubt that the leadership of a man who may have told a woman “you might have to give a blowjob every once in a while” for him to help with her career would impact the tone of coverage on women at Fox News. But the disparagement of women at Fox, whether its employees or its viewers, isn’t just about Ailes. So long as the network is a mouthpiece for the right, it will continue to reflect outdated notions about women’s roles. The entire conservative movement is built on a foundation that assumes traditional gender roles are best, that women belong in the home and that it is natural for men to be sexually aggressive. That is not a problem that begins or ends with one man it’s a problem with an entire vision of politics and society. As feminism becomes more and more powerful, as women refuse to take harassment and slights sitting down, bosses and leaders like Ailes will find it harder to make excuses for their horrible behavior. But if we’re thinking bigger, I can’t help but hope as the presidential election draws closer that this trend will broaden, and women will deliver a clear message to the country’s most famous misogynist: you’re fired.

’Very real risk’ of South Sudan atrocities, UN secretary general warns
UN secretary general Ban   has warned of a “very real risk of mass atrocities” in South Sudan and that peacekeepers deployed in the   country will not be able to stop such a bloodbath. Ban told the security council in a report released on Wednesday that the United Nations must clearly define what actions it is prepared to take in the event of mass killings. “There is a very real risk of mass atrocities being committed in South Sudan, particularly following the sharp rise in hate speech and ethnic incitement in recent weeks,” Ban said. While UN peacekeepers will resort to “all necessary means” to protect civilians, “it must be clearly understood that United Nations peacekeeping operations do not have the appropriate manpower or capabilities to stop mass atrocities,” he added. Nearly 14, 000 soldiers and police are deployed in the UN mission in South Sudan (UNMiss) but a recent report showed the peacekeepers failed to protect civilians during an outbreak of heavy fighting in the capital in July. “The limits on UNMiss’s ability to protect civilians in the current environment have been demonstrated clearly,” he said in the report sent to the council last week. Ban plans to dispatch a delegation to the African Union in Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa to agree on a joint plan to confront a possible outbreak of mass violence in South Sudan. The plan could include the creation of an    force that would quickly deploy in a crisis. The world’s youngest nation, South Sudan descended into war in December 2013, leaving tens of thousands dead and more than 2. 5 million people displaced. The country won independence from Sudan in 2011, with strong support from the United States. A peace deal between President Salva Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar in August last year had raised hopes of peace, until clashes erupted in Juba four months ago. The UN security council agreed to deploy a regional force to Juba to improve security, but the government has balked at the deployment of the 4, 000 troops. In a separate confidential letter to the council, obtained by Agence   Ban said Kiir’s government had shown “piecemeal and limited consent” for the proposed regional force while continuing to impede UNMISS in its work on the ground. The council, which will discuss South Sudan on Thursday, has threatened to impose an arms embargo on South Sudan for its refusal to cooperate, but it has yet to take action. “South Sudan is inundated with weaponry, which is often turned on defenseless civilians,” Ban said in his report, adding that “under the present circumstances, stopping the flow of additional arms into the country is critical for the protection of civilians”.

Pity Aleppo as Putin drops his bombs to salvage Russia’s pride
A few days after Russia launched its military intervention in Syria in September 2015, Barack Obama said it would “get stuck in a quagmire and it won’t work”. Ten months on, that has yet to come to pass. As Russia helps its ally Bashar   try to retake Aleppo, the last strategic urban stronghold of the Syrian opposition, there aren’t many signs of the Kremlin’s war machine being either hamstrung or stuck. Indeed Russia seems to have registered more victories than setbacks in Syria. Hardly anyone remembers that, just last March, Vladimir Putin had announced he would begin withdrawing his forces. The withdrawal turned out to be as theoretical as Obama’s quagmire. Most attempts to explain Putin’s military operation in Syria have focused on the following: 1) allergic to popular uprisings, he wants to prevent regime change in Damascus of the sort that happened in 2011 in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya 2) he wants to secure Russia’s last foothold in the Arab world 3) he wants to demonstrate Russia will do what it takes to defend an ally 4) he wishes to divert attention from Ukraine as well as extract western concessions such as the easing of sanctions 5) he is opportunistic and has capitalised on American unwillingness to get further involved in the Middle East 6) he believes that by creating chaos, even if there is no clear endgame, Russia shows it can overturn western plans  7) it’s all about Russian domestic politics: nationalism and military assertiveness go hand in hand with Putin’s need to safeguard his own power structure. There is probably truth to all of the above. But as Russia’s bombers hammer Aleppo’s besieged population in what could be the most decisive battle of Syria’s civil war, consider this as another piece to the puzzle of Putin’s mind: Syria is where Russia wants to erase the humiliation of the Soviet Union’s defeat in Afghanistan in the 1980s. When Obama predicted a quagmire, he meant a repetition of the Soviet quagmire in the Hindu Kush. He was in effect likening Putin to Brezhnev sending his forces into Afghanistan in 1979, a war that ended very badly for the USSR and arguably played a key role in its demise. Tony Blinken, deputy secretary of state and formerly Obama’s national security adviser, told reporters the Russians were “making a terrible strategic mistake” in Syria, and added: “I think they remember Afghanistan. ” Well, the Kremlin does remember Afghanistan. Russia’s leadership wants Syria to be the exact opposite of that disaster. Syria is meant to restore Russia’s authority as a military power. It is Moscow’s first military deployment outside the territory of the former Soviet Union since Afghanistan. Putin joined the KGB in 1975, four years before the invasion started. Even if he never served there, that conflict and its outcome most certainly left an impact on him. Last year’s winner of the Nobel prize for literature, Svetlana Alexievitch, described in one of her books, Zinky Boys: Soviet Voices from a Forgotten War, the trauma experienced by a whole generation  —   the stories of war atrocities that fed back into Soviet society, despite the censorship. The war ended in 1989 after Gorbachev ordered his country’s troops out. There were propaganda images of cheering soldiers sitting on armoured vehicles as they crossed the Amu Darya river back into Soviet territory. But it was a devastating humiliation for a superpower to be defeated by a ragtag army of Afghan mujahideens to which the CIA had given Stinger missiles. About 15, 000 Soviet soldiers died in Afghanistan, and an estimated 1 million Afghan civilians. Months later, the Berlin wall fell and Soviet power unravelled. Afghanistan was to the Soviet Union what Vietnam was to America, only with the added consequence that the USSR literally broke up as a state shortly afterwards. Putin needn’t publicly frame his Syria gambit as revenge against America for the losses the Soviets suffered decades ago in Afghanistan. But the psychological effect of undoing US strategies in the Middle East amounts much to the same. Look at the parallels: when the Soviets entered Afghanistan, Americans seemed mired in endless arguments about themselves  —   first over Vietnam, then over Watergate. Today, Russia is pushing its advantage in Syria at a time when the US is enmeshed in the Trump era of politics and growing isolationism. In 1979, Soviet sympathisers in the west applauded the intervention in Afghanistan (the leader of the French communist party, Georges Marchais, said it was aimed at ending “feudalism”). Today in Europe and the US (and not just among the far right) there are voices expressing admiration for Putin’s policies in Syria. The comparison is not exact. The Soviet army carried out a massive ground invasion of Afghanistan, which at its peak involved 115, 000 soldiers. In Syria, Russia has mostly limited itself to an air war, even if it has “military advisers” on the ground and mans air defences and artillery. In Syria, Russia has a key external ally: Iran. In 1979, by contrast, Iran was seen by Moscow as a foe, because Iranian Islamists who had overthrown the Shah had started destabilising Kabul’s     government. In 1979, Jimmy Carter said the invasion of Afghanistan was “the most serious threat to peace since the second world war”. In 2015, Russia’s move into Syria was almost met with a shrug by Obama, even if Washington was completely caught  . In 1979, the Soviets attacked on Christmas Eve, as if they hoped it would be less noticed. In September 2015, Putin announced the Syria operation in a speech at the UN. In 1979, the USSR was raking in huge profits from high oil prices. In 2015, Russia launched its war in Syria while it entered a recession. There are lessons from the Afghanistan campaign in the 1980s of which Putin may well be mindful. Mission creep is something he will want to avoid in Syria. The recent downing of a Russian military helicopter by Syrian rebels (all five crew members were killed) may have rekindled painful memories. Just as the Soviet army could not “hold” Afghanistan, neither Assad’s forces nor Hezbollah, nor the Iranian forces involved in the fighting, can hope to ever control the whole of Syria. Still, Russia has so far successfully shored up Assad by intervening  —   whereas the Soviet Union ultimately failed to save an ally regime in Afghanistan (its then proclaimed objective). It is impossible to say how sustainable Russia’s gains are today. But Putin surely remembers how the man he has often tried to imitate, Yuri Andropov, a powerful Soviet intelligence chief, said in a politburo meeting in 1979: “We cannot lose Afghanistan. ” Putin thinks he cannot lose Syria.

Snowden: ’Politics of fear’ keep Trudeau from repealing Canada anti-terror law
Edward Snowden has waded into the simmering debate over Canada’s controversial   law, saying that Justin Trudeau was reluctant to repeal the law out of a fear of appearing soft on terror.  Speaking to an audience in Toronto on Tuesday, Snowden pointed to a campaign promise by the Canadian prime minister to amend the sweeping legislation, which gives security forces heightened powers to apprehend suspected terrorists and disrupt their activities. “But he’s been in office a little while now and we haven’t seen that actually come to pass,” said Snowden, appearing at the SecTor cybersecurity conference via videolink from Russia. Bill   was introduced in early 2015 by the country’s then Conservative government, spawning protests across the country as it became law. Hundreds of thousands of Canadians, including legal scholars, civil liberties groups and pundits from across the political spectrum, spoke out against the law and its perceived attempt to supplant the country’s democracy with a creeping police state. Trudeau vowed to amend the “problematic elements” of the law, rather than simply repeal the legislation, noted Snowden. “Because he’s afraid of being politically attacked on the basis of being soft on terrorism, regardless of whether or not this law actually helps prevent any terrorist attacks,” he said. “This is just the way the politics of fear work. ” Last month the Liberal government launched a   consultation on national security, meaning any potential changes to the law will probably be delayed until next year. The extra time will offer the government the opportunity to get it right, said Ralph Goodale, Canada’s public safety minister, as he announced the consultation. “A lot of people felt shut out, and we promised to give them the opportunity to be heard. ”  On Tuesday, Snowden suggested what he described as the minimum changes needed to the law, such as the creation of a judicial body that would carry out a    review of every individual exercise of these powers. “And this means those individuals working in those spy agencies know simply that as long as they follow the law, they’ll be fine,” he said. The law allows information on Canadians to be shared between more than a dozen federal institutions. “All the activities held in our private lives, our private records, are being used as a kind of currency to gain standing and status within this surveillance network,” said Snowden. “We’re being traded like baseball cards. ”  Any sharing of information  —   by those within Canada and with foreign agencies  —   that doesn’t result in a trial or charges should be disclosed to individuals once a particular time frame has lapsed, he said, allowing people to ensure their rights have not been violated in any way. Snowden also took aim at the law’s vague and undefined language. “A lot of what classifies as terrorism in the political context  —   individuals that the news calls terrorist  —   are really common criminals,” said Snowden. “But they do not constitute the kind of super criminal threat that is represented by our terrorism legislation. ” He pointed to the obvious need for law enforcement to have the right tools to counter these threats. “But we do not want to sacrifice everything that makes our societies great,” he said. “We do not want to reorder the boundaries of our rights for the convenience of law enforcement officials, if it’s not truly necessary, if it means we lose everything that we’re trying to defend. ”

I went shooting with queer gun activists, but it didn’t make me feel any safer
When I woke up to the news that 49 people had died at an LGBT nightclub massacre in Orlando, I turned off my phone and fell back asleep, drifting into nightmares. I couldn’t stop myself from imagining a shooter armed with an assault rifle terrorizing the first gay bars I attended after coming out of the closet. Distraught, I was unable to get out of bed for hours. One week later, I put on bright green headphones and plastic goggles, clutched a . 45 caliber handgun with a   pattern on the grip, and fired a round of bullets into the chest of a human outline drawn on a paper target. I had never shot a gun before. As a queer person of color, I felt queasy about my editors’ idea that I spend time at a shooting range with   activists so soon after the unimaginably horrific attack on the LGBT community during Latino night at Pulse. But the Pink Pistols are not your average gun advocates, and they have been receiving a great deal of attention in the wake of the Orlando atrocity. The group is a national LGBT firearms club that encourages queer people to arm themselves and fight back against new gun restrictions. Membership, organizers say, has tripled since the attack in Orlando. There’s a history of marginalized groups taking up arms to defend themselves against racist and homophobic violence  —   a narrative conveniently absent from the modern gun control debate.  In the 1960s, when the Black Panthers asserted their rights to protect black neighborhoods with armed patrols, Ronald Reagan and other Republicans came out in support of gun restrictions. In an even more forgotten chapter of gun rights, a San Francisco LGBT group called the Lavender Panthers used firearms to defend queers from gay bashings in the 1970s. The Pink Pistols, I would find out, is not an organization that evolved from the brave black and queer groups that fought back against violent assaults of decades past. Instead, while it may defy social expectations and challenge identity politics, its arguments emulate the conventional wisdom propagated by the conservative National Rifle Association.  Still, when I drove an hour south of San Francisco to a small shooting range called Target Masters, I was hopeful I might hear a more nuanced perspective on the highly charged debates on guns and homophobia that have emerged from the 12 June massacre. Like others, I’ve grown weary of hearing straight, white politicians use the tragedy to push gun control or mass surveillance while glossing over the reality that the shooting was an assault on LGBT people and Latinos. At the suburban strip mall that housed the gun range, Nicki Stallard greeted me, a briefcase filled with guns in her hand. The    transgender woman and chapter leader of the Pink Pistols told me with a laugh that she gets along well with conservatives who oppose gays, as well as liberals who oppose guns. There are more than 300 members in her local San Jose chapter. “I do not like violence,” she said. “But I accept that when violence is called for in the situation, where I have to defend my life, where I have to protect it, it is the only answer. ” I was initially intrigued by the idea of a gun as an empowering tool for LGBT people who face disproportionate rates of violence. I know what it’s like to feel physically unsafe simply because I’m visibly queer. Whether it was middle school teasing or a boyfriend letting go of my hand in public for fear that we might be harassed or worse, I’ve spent a lot of energy wondering if I look and sound straight enough to avoid danger. I know that for trans women of color, the threats are significantly greater. Whether it’s bullying, street insults, or physical attacks by strangers or family members, there are so many forms of violence facing vulnerable queers. But firing a gun did not give me strength  —   it made me feel physically ill. I shuddered every time a shooter next to me fired a bullet. With each loud explosion, my anxiety grew. I could not stop thinking about the brief moment when Pulse clubgoers thought the gunman’s shots were just another dance beat. I could not stop picturing people hiding in the bathroom at Pulse, waiting to die. I could not stop remembering the gruesome fact that investigators faced a room filled with bodies and cellphones ringing off the hook as loved ones kept calling. When it was my turn to shoot, my hands were so shaky that I couldn’t load the gun. Nicki was a patient teacher, and eventually I held my breath and fired. I thought about what it must feel like to be on the receiving end of a powerful bullet, and I got out of the room as quickly as possible. Later, I was so overwhelmed recounting the gunfire that I broke down. Although we share a queer identity, the Pink Pistols and I have little common ground.  I cannot accept that standing up to homophobic hate and violence means, as Nicki suggested to me, arming more queers, expanding security and police in LGBT spaces, and assigning “designated shooters” to go with us to the nightclub, sober and packing.  As Nicki demonstrated how she would have stopped the Orlando shooter if she was armed at Pulse, I understood the painfully depressing truth of the Pink Pistols’ message. They accept gun violence as normal, promote a grotesque culture of firearms, and blame LGBT people for showing up to nightclubs unarmed. And if I learned anything from my trip to Target Masters, it’s that there’s nothing empowering about loading a gun and firing back.

Progress Personified​: amputee turns life around by deciding to climb Mount Everest
Charlie Linville has an unusual relationship with fear. He craves it. In many ways, it’s what makes him feel the most alive. When the US Marine Corps sergeant wanted to progress his career during a deployment Afghanistan, he went from ground soldier to bomb technician. His job: diffuse and dispose of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). One day while on patrol, he stepped on a mine and passed out on the ground. “As I started to come out of my stupor, I realized that my fingers were no longer attached and my right leg was just killing me,” he recalls.

Kissinger hindered US effort to end mass killings in Argentina, according to files
Former secretary of state Henry Kissinger jeopardized US efforts to stop mass killings by Argentina’s   military dictatorship by congratulating the country’s military leaders for “wiping out” terrorism, according to a large trove of newly declassified state department files. The documents, which were released on Monday night, show how Kissinger’s close relationship to Argentina’s military rulers hindered Jimmy Carter’s    attempts to influence the regime during his   presidency. Carter officials were infuriated by Kissinger’s attendance at the 1978 World Cup in Argentina as the personal guest of dictator Jorge Videla, the general who oversaw the forced disappearance of up to 30, 000 opponents of the military regime. At the time, Kissinger was no longer in office after Carter defeated Gerald Ford in the 1976 presidential election, but the documents reveal that US diplomats feared his praise for Argentina’s crackdown would encourage further bloodshed. During his years as secretary of state, Kissinger had encouraged Argentina’s military junta to stamp out “terrorism”. In contrast, Carter and Zbigniew Brzezinski, his national security adviser, made human rights a cornerstone of US foreign policy and were exerting pressure on Argentina’s military regime by withholding loans and sales of military equipment. The newly declassifed cables show how Kissinger lauded Videla and other officials for their methods during his 1978 visit. “His praise for the Argentine government in its campaign against terrorism was the music the Argentine government was longing to hear,” says one of the documents.  Another diplomatic cable describes how, during a lunch with Videla, “Kissinger applauded Argentina’s efforts in combatting terrorism” and lamented that “it was unfortunate many Americans thought Argentina was a soft drink. He said this indicated that Americans are not aware of Argentine history nor of its struggle against terrorism. ” Kissinger even held a private meeting with Videla without the presence of the US ambassador to Buenos Aires, Raúl Castro, at which human rights and Carter’s foreign policy were discussed. “Videla prearranged it so Kissinger and the interpreter would meet with him privately half an hour before ambassador’s arrival,” one cable shows. In another    meeting with the Argentinian Council of International Relations (CARI)  —   a group of conservative and highly influential Argentinian diplomats  —   Kissinger went even further, stating that “in his opinion the government of Argentina had done an outstanding job in wiping out terrorist forces”. US ambassador Castro was shocked by Kissinger’s behaviour. “My only concern is that Kissinger’s repeated high praise for Argentina’s action in wiping out terrorism . .. may have gone to some considerable extent to his hosts’ heads,” the ambassador said in a lengthy cable to Washington. “There is some danger that Argentines may use Kissinger’s laudatory statements as justification for hardening their human rights stance. ” Officials in Washington were furious. “[Kissinger’s] praise for the Argentine government in its campaign against terrorism was the music the Argentine government was longing to hear,” National Security Council official Robert Pastor wrote in a summary of Kissinger’s visit for Brzezinski. “What concerns me is his apparent desire to speak out against the Carter administration’s human rights policy,” Pastor fumed. The newly released documents show that at one stage the Carter administration considered asking Pope John Paul II to intervene with Argentina’s military rulers. A lengthy September 1980 cable marked “confidential” said that “the Church and the Pope have far more influence here than the US government and can be the most effective advocates of a full return to the rule of law”. The cable  —   to US officials in Rome  —   says that “the Vatican may be the most effective advocate” before the Argentinian authorities, for whom “disappearance is still the standard tactic”. The documents do not reveal if US diplomats did approach the Vatican, and the exact role of the Catholic church during those dark years remains an issue of debate: many reports indicate that priests were present during torture sessions. It was not until 2000 that the Argentinian Catholic church finally apologized for turning a blind eye to the repression. The cables also give a frightening picture of the delusional antisemitism prevalent among Argentina’s generals, who were convinced that Brzezinski (a   Catholic) headed a worldwide Jewish conspiracy against Argentina. To fight against this perceived conspiracy, the regime kidnapped the successful Jewish newspaper publisher Jacobo Timerman. Thanks largely to strong pressure from the Carter administration, Timerman was finally freed, although he was stripped of his Argentinian citizenship and expelled to Israel, where he spoke to US diplomats about the torture he had endured. “Timerman said that the main focus of questioning during his imprisonment was his role as the Argentine ‘leader’ of an alleged world Zionist conspiracy,” states a declassified cable from the US embassy in Tel Aviv. Another report from Pastor to Brzezinski  —   headed “You don’t look Jewish”  —   relates incredulously how Timerman told US diplomats that “much of the Argentine military believe that a   Jewish conspiracy is at the heart of the terrorist problem in Argentina, and that you (Brzezinski) are at the head of that conspiracy”. When Timerman pointed out to his captors that Brzezinski was Catholic, they told him it was simply a ruse, Pastor wrote. “They ‘know’ you are Jewish because they studied the New York City phone book and found that a number of ‘Brzezinskis’ had Jewish first names!” he wrote. The documents’ release  —   which had been announced by Barack Obama during a visit to Argentina in March  —   was welcomed by Argentina’s human rights secretary, Claudio Avruj. “We’re surprised by the speed with which the US has delivered this documentation,” he told reporters. “We thought it would take longer. ”

Zuckerberg proves he is Facebook’s editor by allowing Trump’s hate speech
Mark Zuckerberg is officially the    of the world’s largest news organization, though he may not know it yet. Two news items on Friday suggest that Facebook is instituting editorial standards analogous to those of a newspaper  —   and that Zuckerberg has the final say in matters of editorial judgment. The company announced on Friday that it will no longer censor graphic material that is “newsworthy, significant, or important to the public interest  —   even if they might otherwise violate our standards”. The decision to allow for “highly subjective” judgments about the newsworthiness of content  —   a core function of traditional news outlets  —   is a major shift for the social media platform whose chief executive insists that it is “not a media company”.  “Our intent is to allow more images and stories without posing safety risks or showing graphic images to minors and others who do not want to see them,” Facebook executives Joel Kaplan and Justin Osofsky wrote in a blogpost announcing the change.  The policy change comes a month after Facebook sparked controversy by censoring a Norwegian newspaper’s publication of the iconic photograph of a naked girl fleeing a napalm attack during the Vietnam war. Espen Egil Hansen, the    of Aftenposten, challenged Zuckerberg to recognize his role as “the world’s most powerful editor” in a   open letter.  Facebook subsequently backed down on the “napalm girl” photograph  —   though not before it had deleted a post by Norway’s prime minister. At the time, the company promised to meet with publishers to discuss the balance between “free expression” and “keep[ing] our community safe”. Friday’s policy update appears to be a result of those meetings. The company did not provide details on how exactly editorial judgments will be made, saying only: “We will work with our community and partners to explore exactly how to do this, both through new tools and approaches to enforcement. ”  Facebook did not respond to questions about what its editorial chain of command would be. However, a report in the Wall Street Journal suggests that the buck stops with Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg decided not to remove posts by Donald Trump, despite the fact that they violated the company’s rules barring hate speech, according to the report. When employees complained about the double standard, Zuckerberg allegedly defended the judgment call in a weekly “town hall” meeting with staff. “Mr Zuckerberg acknowledged that Mr Trump’s call for a ban [of Muslims] did qualify as hate speech, but said the implications of removing them were too drastic,” the Wall Street Journal reported.  “When we review reports of content that may violate our policies, we take context into consideration. That context can include the value of political discourse,” Facebook said in response to the Wall Street Journal article.  The company added that because Trump’s posts were “an important part of the conversation around who the next US president will be” it was reviewing reports on his posts “on a case by case basis”.  In late August, Facebook fired the team of editors responsible for curating news for its “trending” news module.  The company did not respond to the Guardian’s questions about whether it would hire new editors to implement its new editorial standards.

Common ground on Syria unites Russia and Turkey against the west
One year ago, the killing of the Russian ambassador to Ankara by a former Turkish policeman would have provoked a rupture in   relations on the scale that followed the shooting down of a Russian plane by the Turkish jets in November 2015.  But ahead of Andrei’s Karlov’s funeral on Thursday, there has been no Russian démarche. Instead the two countries appear drawn closer towards a new embrace, taking Turkey ever further away from the west. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, declared for the first time it was obvious that the assassin was a follower of Fetullah Gülen, the cleric living in American exile and allegedly the ringleader of a shadowy movement behind July’s abortive military coup. His followers even implied the CIA may have been involved in Karlov’s murder. Russia has sent 18 investigators to Ankara, but Moscow accepted Ankara’s condolences delivered in person by Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, the Turkish foreign minister, when he arrived in Russia on Tuesday for a prearranged meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov. The reason for the Russian restraint is simple. The president, Vladimir Putin, after the fall of Aleppo, is in the middle of a power play, and the death of a diplomat, however talented and tragic, will not avert him from his chosen course. Exasperated by what he sees as the American failure to deliver on its promises to isolate the jihadis in the Syrian opposition, Putin plans with Turkey and Iran to prepare his own Syrian peace roadmap. He wants to capitalise on his military victory with a diplomatic triumph. Tuesday’s meeting between the foreign ministers of Turkey Russia and Iran, with its portentous Moscow Declaration, is supposed to be the first stage in the closure of the civil war on Russian terms. At this point at least, the Gulf States, Europe and the US are excluded from the process. Moscow even said “almost every level of dialogue with the US is now frozen. We don’t communicate with one another, or if we do at minimal level”. But Putin may find diplomatic success more elusive than victory on the battlefield. Above all, he depends on the help of Turkey, the most loyal supporters of the Syrian opposition through the past five years. Apart from energy cooperation, the best deal he can offer Erdoğan is a guarantee that the Syrian Kurds on Turkey’s southern border will not be strengthened by any agreement. Hatred of Kurdish independence, even more than hatred of the Gülenists, binds Erdoğan’s supporters together. But Turkey itself is internally divided. There is a strong Eurasianist group around Erdoğan that want to cut their losses with the EU after years of being rebuffed and lack of gratitude for housing millions of Syrian refugees. Others say Europe remains the only viable route to economic modernisation. In Moscow, Çavuşoğlu pointedly said a ceasefire in Syria should not only exclude terrorist groups such as Islamic State and Jabhat Fateh   but also Lebanon’s Hezbollah  —   which fights on the government side. Lavrov implied Hezbollah, like Russia, was in Syria at the government’s invitation.   feeling is at a fever pitch in Erdoğan’s party since it is Tehran’s artillery, as much as Moscow’s air power, that led to the humiliation of Aleppo. Possibly unclear himself of his strategy, Putin has said his initiative is designed to complement, and not conflict with, the UN’s existing peace process. But his move has caused unease in the UN Staffan de Mistura, the UN Syrian special envoy, has announced he will convene rival UN talks on 8 February in Geneva. So far, the UN talks have been plagued by Syrian government objections to the composition of the opposition delegations, the role of the Syrian Kurds and whether it is a requirement that the Syrian government accepts that the president, Bashar   will stand down in some way at the end of a transition process. Putin’s rival peace show may take place in Astana, the capital of Kazakstan. Surrounded by the world’s largest steppe, the futuristic, even bizarre, city is not an entirely random venue to choose since it has played a role in trying to normalise relations between Turkey and Russia, two of its closest allies.  It hosted members of the Syrian opposition for talks in May 2015 and has overseen various other international mediation efforts, including 2013 talks between Iran and the P5+1. The May 2015 Syrian talks were initiated by Randa Kassis, the head of the Coalition of Secular and Democratic Syrians. Many rebel groups regard Kassis as part of a tame tolerated opposition with little popular support, but she met Donald Trump’s son in Paris recently, suggesting her political star is in the ascendant. However, any attempt to   these talks without key members of the opposition, including those in the   high negotiations committee are likely to leave them discredited. Putin may just be starting to find his role as the great disrupter is a lot easier than that of the great conciliator.

Female tourists should not wear skirts in India, says tourism minister
India’s tourism minister has said foreign women should not wear skirts or walk alone at night in the country’s small towns and cities “for their own safety”. Discussing tourist security in the north Indian city of Agra, site of the Taj Mahal, Mahesh Sharma said foreign arrivals to India were issued a welcome kit that included safety advice for women. “In that kit they are given dos and don’ts,” he said on Sunday. “These are very small things like, they should not venture out alone at night in small places, or wear skirts, and they should click the photo of the vehicle number plate whenever they travel and send it to friends. ” He added: “For their own safety, women foreign tourists should not wear short dresses and skirts . .. Indian culture is different from the western. ” The welcome kit, geared at female travellers and introduced last year, is one of a suite of measures introduced to address declining rates of female tourism after the     and murder of a Delhi medical student in 2012, and a number of subsequent attacks on female tourists.  The kit says: “Some parts of India, particularly the smaller towns and villages, still have traditional styles of dressing. Do find out about local customs and traditions or concerned authorities before visiting such places. ” It mirrors the UK Foreign Office advice to women travelling in India, which suggests they “respect local dress codes and customs and avoid isolated areas, including beaches, when alone at any time of day”. Sharma clarified his remarks later on Sunday, denying they amounted to a dress code for foreign women. ”We have not given any specific instructions regarding what they should wear or not wear. We are asking them to take precaution while going out at night. We are not trying to change anyone’s preference,” he said. “It was very stupid, not a fully   statement,” said Ranjana Kumari, the director of the   Centre for Social Research, a thinktank focusing on gender equality in India. “The minister doesn’t realise the implications of such irresponsible statements. ” Kumari said the remarks reflected “the syndrome of blaming women” for what they wore and where they were. She said: “But the problem is men and boys in India. They go for all kinds of misogyny and sexual acts, rapes and  . It’s important for [Sharma] to have said how to punish the perpetrators of crime and stop the nonsense of ogling women and following them. Why should any girls come to India when it is becoming famous for not being safe to girls?” India toughened sentences for rape and introduced   courts for sexual assault trials after the fatal 2012   focused world attention on violence against women in the country. National crime statistics show 92 women are raped each day in India, mostly in rural areas, though the figure is widely believed to be an underestimate. Street harassment and violence, sometimes called “ ” is even more common, experienced by 79% of Indian women according to a recent survey. Tourists can be subjected to the same harassment and worse, most recently in July 2016 when an Israeli national was sexually assaulted by a gang of men in the Himalayan resort town of Manali. A Japanese woman was kidnapped and sexually assaulted in 2014 in Bihar and a Russian assaulted by an   driver in Delhi in 2015, among other cases. Sharma’s remarks trended on Indian social media on Monday and earned rebukes from political rivals. Sharma has previously been criticised over his views on nights out for women. “It may be alright elsewhere, but it is not part of Indian culture,” he said last year.

Trump reportedly used charity money to settle legal claims – as it happened
Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, defended Trump’s use of funds from the Donald J Trump Foundation to pay off his legal debts, telling CNN’s Erin Burnett that the Trump family doesn’t take money as a salary from running the foundation and that the money was Trump’s to give away. “You know, the Trump Foundation started with Mr. Trump’s money,” Conway said, neglecting to mention that Trump has not donated to his eponymous foundation since 2008. “The Trump Foundation has no permanent staff, no paid staff, no overhead, no one from the Trump family takes a penny in. ” Donald Trump’s campaign manager has only the utmost respect for former president George HW Bush, whose age she mentioned casually while discussing his alleged plan to vote for Hillary Clinton: Fending off several controversies on Tuesday, Donald Trump started another when he proclaimed at a North Carolina rally that “our   communities are in the worst shape they’ve ever been . .. Ever. Ever. Ever. ” The plainly inaccurate statement, which was immediately lambasted on social media for failing to consider the long history of slavery and racial discrimination against African Americans, marked the latest misstep by the Trump campaign as the Republican nominee has struggled to harness the terrorist attacks in New York and New Jersey for his political advantage. A day after the apprehension of suspected bomber Ahmad Khan Rahami, Trump made his remarks in Kenansville, North Carolina, and repeated familiar themes to crowds at multiple rallies across the swing state. “Immigration security is national security,” he said, and repeatedly read the lyrics of the The Snake, a 1960s soul song about a woman who finds a dying snake and nurses it back to health. The snake then fatally bites her. To Trump, this was a parable about the consequences of the United States taking in refugees. The Republican nominee went on to describe Clinton as “the vessel for all the global special interests seeking to run our lives” and said that the “failed political establishment” had “vested” in her “all of their money, all of their hopes for another generation of corruption”. Trump also argued that the “dishonest media” had “bled this country dry”. But, Trump ran into more controversy when the Washington Post reported that the billionaire converted $258, 000 in donations to the Donald Trump Foundation to settle lawsuits against himself. The payments represent an apparent violation of tax laws that could potentially even force the IRS to shut down the Trump Foundation. Trump further stoked controversy by bragging on Tuesday about spending “OPM  —   other people’s money”. Texas senator and former presidential contender Ted Cruz declined to say if he plans to endorse Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, again: Donald Trump called for a more rigorous immigration policy following the arrest of an American man born in Afghanistan for bombing attacks in New York and New Jersey this weekend. The Republican presidential nominee spoke to supporters at High Point University in North Carolina today and reiterated his vow to build a wall on the   border. Former secretary of state and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign has filed its September Federal Election Commission report for the month of August, revealing that the nominee raised more than $62m in August for her campaign, as well as roughly $78m for allied action funds for state Democratic parties, from more than 1. 1 million contributions, with an average contribution of $50. The campaign begins the month of September with more than $68m in the bank. “The millions of Americans who have contributed to this campaign and to the Democratic Party have ensured that we head into the final 50 days of the election with the most robust organizing effort in history, and the resources we need to mobilize the millions of voters we need to elect progressive candidates up and down the ballot,” campaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement. “With voting already underway in some parts of the country, the race will continue to tighten and we will need to fight for every vote and do everything we can to make sure our message cuts through and that Democrats turn out to vote. ” More than 60% of the campaign’s August contributions were from women, and roughly $17m were raised from contributions lower than $200. The Clinton campaign has raised more than $412m over the course of the campaign, and begins the month with more than $10m cash on hand than it began August. Donald Trump’s latest comments maybe needs a  : Our African American communities are in the worse shape they’ve ever been. Ever. Ever. Ever. Former secretary of state Madeleine Albright has released a message sent to President barack Obama ahead of his remarks at a UN Refugee Summit regarding her own history as a refugee. Considering the recent political news involving debates over the acceptance of refugees from the Syrian civil war, it’s relevant reading:  I came to the United States as a refugee when I was 11 years old. My father was a diplomat and a strong supporter of democracy in Czechoslovakia, so when the Communists took over, we were forced into exile as refugees. In November 1948, we were welcomed to the United States of America. Becoming a US citizen is the most important thing that ever happened to me. My father said that when we were in Europe during WWII people would say, ‘We are sorry for your troubles and hope that you have everything you need by the way, when will you be leaving to go back home?’ But in America, people said: ‘We are sorry for your troubles and hope that you have everything you need by the way, when will you become a citizen?’ America resettles more refugees than any other nation because it reflects one of our noblest traditions as a nation: providing support to those who are most vulnerable. With the world facing the largest mass displacement on record since World War II, it has never been more important for world leaders to follow America’s example and work together to do more to support refugees. ... When countries with insufficient resources take in refugees, it creates more instability, not just at the frontlines of this crisis, but around the world. If we were to slam the door in the faces of refugees with certain religious backgrounds, we would defy our history and our principles of pluralism and diversity. As we talk to other nations about what more needs to be done to tackle this crisis, it’s important that President Obama is setting this example. When I came here as a child, I will never forget sailing into New York Harbor for the first time and beholding the Statute of Liberty. I did not have to face refugee camps or the kind of danger that many refugees endure. But like all refugees, I shared a hope to live a safe life with dignity and a chance to give back to my new country. Together, we can help refugees rebuild their lives and live with dignity once again. Fox News talking head Sean Hannity’s outspoken and material support for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has reached another milestone today, with the release of an   promotional video for the nominee in which Hannity makes an appearance. Hannity, whose eponymous program has long been a favorite slot for Trump to answer softball questions and for the duo to soak up each others’ awesomeness, arrives about six minutes into #HEARTLAND4TRUMP, a promotional video studded with testimonials about the Republican nominee: One of the reasons I’m supporting Donald Trump this year is, number one, he’s going to put originalists on the supreme court   people that believe in fidelity to the constitution, separation of powers,   branches of government. He’s a guy that will vet refugees to keep Americans safe. And, of course, he’s gonna build that wall. He says he’s gonna have Mexico pay for it. That’s fine, as long as we secure the country and of course we don’t want people competing for jobs. He said he will eliminate Obamacare, make us  . And as somebody who’s been a marksman since I’m 11 years old, protecting our Second Amendment rights are paramount to me. The endorsement lasts roughly 30 seconds. On the heels of reports that former Republican president George HW Bush told Kathleen Kennedy Townsend  —   the former lieutenant governor of Maryland and daughter of Robert F Kennedy  —   that he plans to vote for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, CNN is reporting that the former president told board members of the bipartisan Points of Light Foundation that he will, indeed, vote for his former opponent’s spouse: Bush told a room of roughly 40 people Monday that he would vote for Hillary Clinton in November, according to sources close to Bush   an extraordinary rebuke of his own party’s nominee.  Although the Bush family has neither confirmed nor denied the claims of either CNN or Townsend, a family spokesman was pretty coy about the former president’s plans on 8 November. “The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days,” Bush spokesman Jim McGrath said in a statement. “He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim. ” The Donald Trump campaign has elected to lengthen the amount of time Americans spend talking about   racial metaphors that were once used by Nazi war criminals, releasing a statement this afternoon calling Donald Trump Jr. a “tremendous asset to the campaign. ” Don Jr. ignited a firestorm of criticism last night when he tweeted a meme comparing Syrian refugees to poisoned Skittles, but as has become customary with the Trump campaign, the Republican nominee’s communications team has elected to double down on the statement. “Don Jr. has been a tremendous asset to the campaign,” wrote communications advisor Jason Miller in a statement. “America has become less safe under Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and Clinton’s planned 550% increase in Syrian refugees is a dangerous proposal that will put American lives at risk. Speaking the truth might upset those who would rather be politically correct than safe, but the American people want a change, and only Donald Trump will do what’s needed to protect us. ” The same sentiment expressed by Trump was once used in a bid to keep Jewish refugees from entering the United Kingdom. In 1903, Conservative MP Major Sir William Eden   used a very similar metaphor in an address to Parliament: Ten grains of arsenic in a thousand loaves would be unnoticeable and perfectly harmless but the same amount put into one loaf would kill the whole family that partook of it. The Nevada Republican party seems eager to focus on   races this year. .. Donald Trump’s presidential campaign may have lifted the longstanding blacklisting of various media outlets ranging from the Washington Post to Buzzfeed News, but the    candidate’s campaign is still breaking convention in how it treats the reporters assigned to cover the movements of the Republican nominee. Case in point: a new ban on reporters traveling with Trump’s motorcade, a break in   tradition that the campaign originally promised to maintain. “We have communicated that this is an issue that the campaign should have spotted long ago and are vigorously protesting the decision,” Trump’s pool reporters told other members of the pool this morning in am email. “We have told the campaign that if they are truly committed to transparency, than [sic] they should place the pool on Trump’s plane so it is a truly protective pool. They have not been responsive to that request. ” The Trump campaign has resisted calls to include traveling press on his campaign plane, instead opting for a “chaser” plane that had led to delays for reporters traveling with the campaign from reaching his rallies, including an incident last week in which reporters missed a rally in New Hampshire entirely. (Trump mocked the candidates from the lectern for not being able to arrive in time.)

Galaxy Note 7 owners told to turn off phones due to exploding battery risk
The US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) says owners of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphones should turn them off and stop using them because of the risk that their batteries can explode. The agency said Friday that it’s working with Samsung on an official recall of the phones “as soon as possible” and that it’s trying to figure out if the company’s replacement Note 7s are an “acceptable remedy”. Samsung last week began a global recall for the phone, just two weeks after its launch, because of the risk of them catching fire or exploding. At the time, Samsung said it had confirmed 35 instances of the problem, out of 2. 5 million phones sold. The company did not say last week whether users should stop using the phones, and said new phones would be available in about two weeks. But in a statement Friday, Samsung Electronics America asked Note 7 owners to shut off their phones and exchange them now for another device. The company says new Note 7 phones will not be available until after the CPSC finishes its “process” but owners can exchange the Note 7s now for a different model. US aviation safety officials also on Thursday took the unusual step of warning airline passengers not to turn on or charge the phone during flights, or put them in checked bags. The recall comes at a crucial time for Samsung, as its rival Apple just announced its own latest versions of the iPhone. The Note series is one of Samsung’s most expensive, and demand for the phone had been high.

Flash flooding kills at least 21 in Skopje
Macedonia declared a state of emergency in its capital, Skopje, and neighbouring districts on Sunday, a day after at least 21 people were killed in flash floods caused by a storm.  Torrential rain flooded homes, swept away a section of the city’s ring road and wrecked cars late on Saturday evening. Northern suburbs of the capital were particularly hard hit, though the city centre also suffered. Children were among those killed, a police spokesman said, adding that searches were continuing for six people reported missing.  Macedonia, a small former Yugoslav republic of about two million people, has declared Monday a day of national mourning. “This is a catastrophe of unprecedented magnitude,” the deputy prime minister, Nikola Todorov, told reporters.  Special police forces and trucks loaded with drinking water were sent to the worst affected areas, where there also have been electricity outages and the scattered debris of furniture swept from houses was on the streets, a Reuters reporter said.  The rain had stopped by Sunday morning and water levels receded and though there was more rain on Sunday evening  —   there were no reports of further flash flooding. The European Union’s enlargement commissioner, Johannes Hahn, said on Twitter that the EU stood ready to help Macedonia, which is a candidate to join the bloc.  Further north in Croatia, heavy winds caused disruption on some roads, including the closure of the highway linking the capital, Zagreb, to the southern coast for lorries and buses, according to local media.

‘Don’t stop there, it’s a hellhole’: Matthew Abbott captures the murderous, majestic Australian outback
Matthew Abbott was in a   tent about 20km outside Lightning Ridge when he began to feel a profound sense of unease. The Sydney photographer was documenting life in the   towns in the     basin, Australia’s longest river system he had “rocked up” the day before to the Coocoran opal fields and befriended a man who lived in the miners’ camp. “It’s sort of like a farmer’s property, but it’s more like a lawless town,” Abbott explains. “It’s home to some of the roughest people you will come across in the state. One guy I photographed had done 20 years in prison for murder.  “I was hanging out with this [other] guy he had a family in [another town] and he was out there by himself. ” During the day he “seemed normal” Abbott says  —   but, as night fell, the man took to the bottle and his behaviour became increasingly erratic.  “I left him about 11pm to go outside to my tent,” says Abbott. By 2am, he says, the man was ranting, had become violent, and was breaking and throwing objects. Abbott sat alone in his flimsy tent, unsure of his next move. The only other person he knew in the town was the convicted murderer he’d photographed earlier.  “Coocoran is the kind of place where, if you’re murdered, no one would ever find you,” Abbott says. “There’s thousands of opal holes, exploration shafts that go down 10 to 20 metres. I had been told by the locals that people go missing there all the time, normally over personal disputes and things, and they never find the bodies. ”  Deciding to cut his losses, Abbott crawled from his tent, yanked out the poles and hastily stuffed the fabric into his   4WD Pajero. “I burned out of there,” he says.  “But then I was lost in the middle of this place with no signage. There’s no lights, no internet, no phone reception, nothing. All I had was a compass and I just drove  . I ended up driving close to 40 minutes before I hit this main road. ”  Abbott says it was like a scene from the outback horror film Wake in Fright  —   “apocalyptic and full of shady characters   …     it was an Australia I had always dreamed about finding”. Abbott, 31, has a knack for finding himself in hairy situations. In 2014 he photographed the conflict in South Sudan for Associated Press, embedding himself with rebel soldiers. Previously he documented the flight of Myanmar’s Rohingya refugees to Bangladesh, as well as the journey of a Pakistani asylum seeker from Quetta to Australia. This month, while on assignment in Manus Island, a Papua New Guinean police officer threatened to shoot him after he photographed two refugee men who had been brutally attacked by locals (Guardian Australia published the images).  Abbott says while he loves “going to these exotic places” he always finds himself returning to rural Australia. He spent two years in his 20s living with and photographing Indigenous communities in Arnhem Land, a world away from his comfortable private school upbringing on Sydney’s north shore. He says he finds photographing Australia difficult but approaches it with the kind of methodical dedication of someone “learning a new language”.  “As I’ve matured as a photographer, it’s the average, everyday people in the towns along the   river that keep drawing me back. “Every Australian town has a guy sitting at a bar called Robbo, and he’s got a faded Akubra on and he’ll tell you a yarn. I avoid those characters like the plague. I don’t find the cliched guy sitting in the bar interesting. I find the guys getting on with their lives much more interesting.  “Some of the most interesting pictures I’ve taken are in places other people have said, ‘Don’t stop there, it’s a hellhole. ’” Abbott journeyed solo along the   basin on and off between 2014 and 2016, pitching his tent by the side of the road and photographing communities from Tambo in Queensland down to Wilcannia, Broken Hill and Bathurst in New South Wales (he plans to continue his journey in Victoria and South Australia). The towns that were once the backbone of the Australian economy  —   many of which he says “are now former shadows of themselves” owing to climate change, declining youth populations and unemployment  —   are the subject of Abbott’s first solo photographic exhibition, The Land Where the Crow Flies Backwards. Named for a 1965 song by the Indigenous singer Dougie Young, Abbott says a “man v wild” theme permeates his black and white images, which he shot on a cumbersome, two     Toyo 810M field camera.  “The series is about showing the absurdity of the white man living in this harsh environment, and also how the new settlers have approached the landscape. ” At the Lightning Ridge hot springs we meet Julie and John, a Victorian couple originally from eastern Europe, swanning about in swimming costumes with fly nets draped over their faces.  In the same town, we are invited into the subterranean bedroom of a miner named Amigo, who has built a castle (now a tourist attraction) atop his opal mine.  In Morven, Queensland, we stand outside a shack adorned with a handwritten sign: “O what a lovely little town. I wonder how long it will take for you to stuff it right up. ” We journey past   water tanks in Wilcannia see protruding tree roots on the banks of a   Brewarrina riverbed visit a decaying    fibreglass kangaroo sculpture in a Lightning Ridge backyard (another DIY tourist attraction) watch rawboned horses gallop beside the Ford Falcon of a horse trainer in Bathurst and balk at what first appears to be clothes on a wonky Hills Hoist before realising they are dead wild dogs, shot by graziers and strung up on a roadside in Tambo.  “It’s very hard for dog lovers in the city to see this kind of thing but the reality is these dogs can kill four or five sheep in one evening,” explains Abbott. We also meet the steady gaze of local children, both Indigenous and   who have found unlikely playgrounds in truck stops and in the grounds of derelict buildings.  Abbott says because it takes up to 15 minutes to set up a single shot on his film camera, “The person in front of the camera gets very comfortable with you. They also get bored. It’s in the boredom that the real nuggets come out because you see what they’re really thinking. “I sit there with the shutter release in my hand and they still think I’m setting the camera up. I’ll just see a little something in their eye and I’ll pounce. I know every time when I’ve nailed it. ” The sweltering, dusty conditions meant a lot of Abbott’s photographs fell victim to “fogging and light leaks”.  “But I embraced it as it adds this authenticity to the images,” he says. “Often it gives you happy mistakes. ” Abbott says he tried to capture “the ongoing scars of colonisation” the effects of global warming, and “the hundreds of single men I met living these terrible,   lives in these shanty structures”. Still, he insists he didn’t deliberately set out to depict the great Australian nightmare.  “It’s not a journalism piece about what’s happening in the   basin,” he says. “It’s one impression of the area.  “It’s not fictional but it’s not reality, either. I’ve shown quite a bleak side of things but, if there is any hope in these images, it’s with the kids. ”  • The Land Where the Crow Flies Backwards is at the Fox Gallery in Melbourne from 26 August to 26 September

Phaedra(s) review – Isabelle Huppert flays audience in punishing triple bill
It’s tough to feel too much pity for Phaedra  —   bored housewife, bad stepmother and the minor goddess of false rape claims. And it is tougher still while weathering Phaedra( s) Krzysztof Warlikowski’s compilation of three versions of the myth, by Wajdi Mouawad, Sarah Kane and JM Coetzee. In each iteration, Phaedra is played by the French film star Isabelle Huppert, something of a minor goddess herself. But not even her erotic force and emotive mischief can enliven the piece, which runs three and a half hours. Phaedra, the wife of Theseus, is a woman struck with overpowering desire for her stepson. Destroyed by his rejection, Phaedra kills herself, though not before penning a note asserting that he had raped her. Then things really go downhill, sometimes involving sea monsters.  The draw of the piece  —   and the reason why many of the audience members who didn’t leave at intermission gave it a standing ovation  —   is of course Huppert. Now in her 60s, she has lost none of her glamour or her interest in collapsing it. Topped with various wigs and shod in tottering heels, Huppert looks predictably gorgeous in the costumes, which include patrician sheath dresses and a   teddy. But no matter how elegantly dressed, she flings herself breathlessly into the script’s grotesqueries  —   bleeding, vomiting, giving a suffocating blowjob. She doesn’t spare her body or her voice and she doesn’t spare the audience. If only all that energy were in service of something more engaging. Yes, each text deconstructs the myth in a different way, challenging aspects made canonical by Euripides or Seneca. It would be cheering to say that Mouawad’s elliptical poetry, Kane’s shrewd provocations or Coetzee’s playful intellectualism are encouraged to converse but instead the plays simply pile heavily atop each other, a rugby ruck of postmodernism. In Mouawad’s section, perhaps the least engaging as the quick, verbose speech required constant attention to the supertitles, themes of purity and pornography are layered over the myth. In Kane’s version, the puritanical prince Hippolytus is a royal slob, amusing himself with tech gadgets, frequent masturbation, and Psycho played on a loop. In Coetzee’s portion, a novelist delivers a lecture on sexual relations between mortals and gods before returning obliquely to the Phaedra legend and excerpting Racine’s stately alexandrines. For each part, Huppert conjures up a different Phaedra, toying with the idea of love as vitalizing and degrading. Though each piece differs tonally, Warlikowski’s tired style brings to mind the director’s theater of the late 90s and early 00s  —   the mostly bare stage, the clinical lighting, the woman writhing malevolently in stiletto heals and a   bra and panties. Probably she was meant as a   for Aphrodite, suggesting the devastating power of erotic desire while wearing what must have been a very scratchy thong. Goddesses have really come down in the world.

Michael Moore has a ’morning after to-do list’ for how to save America
Documentary   Michael Moore has issued a five point “morning after   list” for Americans struggling to come to terms with Donald Trump’s election victory. Moore, who unexpectedly released his Trumpland documentary last month, wrote a post on Facebook where he provided his    guide, which includes taking over the Democratic party, firing TV pundits and reiterating that Clinton won the popular vote. “Take over the Democratic party and return it to the people. They have failed us miserably,” reads his first point. He continues: “Fire all pundits, predictors, pollsters and anyone else in the media who had a narrative they wouldn’t let go of and refused to listen to or acknowledge what was really going on. ” His third point focuses on Democratic politicians who he says should “step out of the way” unless they are willing to “fight, resist and obstruct in the way Republicans did against President Obama every day for eight full years”. Moore voted for Bernie Sanders in the primaries but in Trumpland he made a strong argument why America should choose her Clinton over Trump. He also made the correct prediction that the states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Ohio would be key and could become what he termed “Brexit states”. In his plan he adds that people must stop saying they are “stunned” and “shocked” adding: “What you mean to say is that you were in a bubble and weren’t paying attention to your fellow Americans and their despair. ” He added that Trump should have never been treated lightly and, echoing the sentiments of Stephen Colbert, said that the media was complicit in helping him rise. “He was never a joke. Treating him as one only strengthened him. He is both a creature and a creation of the media and the media will never own that. ”  His final point struck a more optimistic tone. “You must say this sentence to everyone you meet today: “HILLARY CLINTON WON THE POPULAR VOTE!” The MAJORITY of our fellow Americans preferred Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Period. Fact. If you woke up this morning thinking you live in an   country, you don’t. ”

Pop-up shoppers of the world unite as Morrissey store opens in New York
Lovers of Morrissey, animals and merchandise were treated to an exhibition of all three on Saturday, as the singer hosted a   store at the Sugar Mutts animal shelter in New York. Morrissey announced details of the store, which is selling limited edition   posters and dog apparel, on Facebook. He wasn’t actually manning the “Mporium” but that didn’t stop people lining up outside.  Matt Gross, 35, had been there since 8am, two hours before opening time. “I’m a pit bull advocate and I also volunteer at a shelter,” he said. “So I feel like this is tailor made for me. ” Gross, who said he had two Morrissey tattoos, was due to see the former Smiths singer at the Kings Theatre in Brooklyn on Saturday night. He emerged from Sugar Mutts with a   bearing the legend “Be kind to Morrissey or I’ll kill you” and a    that said: “All over Brooklyn some hope and some despair”. The   carried a picture of Morrissey with a dog superimposed over his face, and a cat superimposed over the dog’s face. Morrissey is donating a percentage of sales from the Mporium to Sugar Mutts, which rescues dogs from “  shelters”. His representatives approached the shelter ahead of his New York show, having held a similar   in Manchester in August. By happy coincidence, Amy Marciano, the founder of the shelter, turned out to be a longtime Morrissey enthusiast. “I was a fan ever since I was a teenager,” she said. “I had Morrissey all over my walls in high school. I love his ethics and his quirky personality. I’ve always loved his music, of course, so I was just thrilled. ” Marciano said she regularly plays Morrissey’s music in the shelter. It is “perfect for dogs” she said, “because it’s that great mix of upbeat alternative rock’n’roll and melancholy introspection. It’s a good mix. ” The animal     store was bustling. The   were available in a range of sizes and seemed to be doing particularly good business, as was a purple   bandana. Frances Eby, 58, bought a   which had a famous image of Morrissey with a cat on his head and the words: “My life with Fanny the wondercat”. Eby was originally going to be called Fanny, she said, after her grandmother, but her parents backed out. Eby had travelled from Maryland to see the Morrissey show. She was with her friend Diane Seltzer, whom she met in 2007 through a Morrissey message board called “Mozketeers”. “I’ve made lifelong friends through Morrissey,” she said. Seltzer, 48, had purchased a necklace which had a pendant in the shape of a cat. The cat had “Morrissey” engraved on it. She and Eby were planning to go to Saturday’s concert with their friend Carol. Carol had not made it to the   store because she was already waiting outside the Kings Theatre. She had been there since 7am, Eby said. Neither early morning rain nor the promise of   merchandise could keep Carol from getting a good spot in the crowd. “She’s OK with it. She’s done it many times,” Eby said. “She’s done it in the snow and everything. ”

Slavoj Žižek: ‘We are all basically evil, egotistical, disgusting’
We are all basically evil, egotistical, disgusting. Take torture, for instance. I am a realist. If I had a daughter and someone kidnapped her, and I found a friend of the kidnapper, I cannot say I wouldn’t torture that guy. I have become more aggressive over time. Some say I am more right wing, which I am absolutely not. On the refugee crisis, we should drop the patronising “They are warm people. ” No, there are murderers among them in the same way there are among us. The liberal left prohibit writing anything bad about refugees, which results in the   right monopolising. I’m not a good father. There is something ridiculous in asserting my dignity which I resist automatically. My teenage son identifies with this undermining of my own authority. When he was 14, I was mad at him and used a vulgar expression in Slovenian: “Let the dog fuck your mother. ” He replied: “That already happened 15 years ago. That’s how I was born. ” My friends call me Fidel. Not because of politics, but because I talk too much. I visited Cuba once and on TV, Fidel Castro was shown entering a meeting saying: “Comrades, five minutes to make some remarks. ” I went to sleep, woke up five hours later, and he was still talking. I hate politically correct arrogance. With black friends, in contrast to politically correct white guys, I establish real contact. How? Through dirty stories, dirty jokes. When you visit a foreign country, you play PC games about your interesting food or music, but how do you become really friendly? You exchange a small obscenity. I’m unable to have   stands. In my city, Ljubljana, you can tell exactly which women I’ve slept with, because I married them. It would be horror to say I love Isis. But look at its organisation with its postmodern fluid identity. There is an emancipatory underground tendency in Islam a wonderful Muslim historian of philosophy developed a claim that Aquinas misread Aristotle under the influence of Islamic poets like Avicenna, which opened up the way for modernity, gay rights and so on. My parents weren’t strict, but they were patronising. I didn’t like them. They both died in hospital during the night, and when I found out over the phone the next morning I was already behind my computer working. I said: “Is everything taken care of? OK, thanks,” and carried on. I felt totally cold  —   something didn’t work there. I am not celebrating myself for that. Hollywood knows everything. It’s obsessed with dystopias, like in Elysium or The Hunger Games. I really think this is one of our quite possible futures. Young people today should prepare for a big catastrophe, but engage in well thought out, local everyday struggles, and not escape into moralism. Writing saved my life. Years ago, because of some private love troubles, I was in a suicidal mood for a couple of weeks. I told myself: “I could kill myself, but I have a text to finish. First I will finish it, then I will kill myself. ” Then there was another text, and so on and so on, and here I still am.

Meet Trump’s 12-year-old campaign chair in a crucial Colorado county
The 2016 presidential race could easily be decided in Colorado’s Jefferson County. The suburbs west of Denver have long been considered a political bellwether for any candidate seeking election to the White House. Yet that does not appear to have discouraged Donald Trump’s campaign entrusting its outreach in the critical county to a   . Weston Imer,   of Republican nominee’s campaign in Jefferson County, dismissed the suggestion that his age should be an impediment. “I know what I’m doing,” he said. “I’ve been in politics since I was very young. I’m good friends with all of the candidates here in Colorado   …     I’m friends with pretty much everyone in the whole darn county and state. ” “The people from the Trump campaign, they trust me, they think I will do what needs to be done here in Jefferson County. ” He added: “It’s a great honor. It’s a once in a lifetime experience to be able to run a campaign at this young of an age, because we’ll never be at this age again. ” Weston shot to notoriety last month after his role in the campaign’s Jefferson branch made national headlines. Some of those reports overstated the clout of the    skirting the fact that he was, in fact, sharing the volunteer role with his mother, Laurel Imer. Fearing a distraction, the Trump campaign has since put a halt on interviews with its youngest political operative, who has not spoken publicly since. Colorado is the state that fomented the   “Never Trump” movement among Republicans disaffected with their nominee  —   and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, had been enjoying a formidable   lead there. Just a few weeks ago there were reports that the Clinton campaign had shelved spending in the state, assuming the state was all but won. But the polls since then have narrowed dramatically, and the candidates now find themselves    in the crucial swing state. Election forecaster Nate Silver has declared Colorado “the tipping point state” as Colorado’s perennial bellwether, Jefferson is once again in the spotlight. “If Donald does not win in Jefferson County, he stands a very strong chance of not winning in Colorado,” Weston said in an interview for the Guardian’s Anywhere But Washington series of election videos. “We need Trump supporters to come out, and be out of the closet, and tell everyone that you support Mr Trump. ” That’s not always easy. Weston said he had suffered some personal repercussions for supporting the controversial GOP nominee. “Even before I was the   kids were bullying me. Especially the Ted Cruz supporters and their parents,” he said. “So did the Hillary Clinton supporters, and so did the Bernie Sanders supporters. ” “I’ve also had kids say that they’re leaving the country if he gets elected to the presidency,” he added. “I told them that they were overreacting, and that their parents were as well. ” The    is also the founder of Colorado Kids for Trump, a group he said he created to support schoolchildren facing similar consequences as a result of their support for the nominee. “If you get bullied at school, contact me, and I will draft a formal letter to your school,” he said. Trump’s political operation might have worried it was taking a risk by making a    a de facto spokesman in such a pivotal swing county. The Republican nominee has repeatedly been tarnished by supporters and surrogates who have made remarks considered inappropriate, even by his standards. Earlier this month, Marco Gutierrez, the   founder of Latinos for Trump, prompted ridicule after warning that if Trump failed to reach the White House there would be “taco trucks on every corner”. Last week, Kathy Miller, an Ohio county chair, was forced to resign after her remarks about race in an interview with Anywhere But Washington went viral. However, if Trump’s political operatives took a risk putting a    in the spotlight, it appears to have paid off. He has shown the discipline and restraint of a seasoned political spokesman, adhering to the Trump campaign’s talking points while lampooning the Republican’s political rival. “I like that he doesn’t speak in politically correct terms, I like that he speaks his mind, I also like his immigration plans and his plans about the refugees coming from overseas, that we need to heavily screen them and put a hold on it until he wipes out Isis,” he said. “He’s going to make America great again. If we don’t elect him we’re going to have Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is a criminal  —   a proven one, to be exact  —   in the presidential office, and if that happens this country will not be here in the first four, or possibly eight years. ” Asked about his political future, Weston, who is also an actor and a singer and said his inspiration is Ronald Reagan, did not miss a beat. “I’m headed politically to run for the presidency in 2040,” he said. “That’ll be my first eligible year, so I’m ambitious. ”

NYPD admits ’we failed’ in police shooting of mentally ill Bronx woman
New York police department officials have conceded that something went wrong in the   to a sergeant fatally shooting a mentally ill    black woman in her own home in the Bronx Tuesday night.  “What is clear in this one instance, we failed,” police chief James O’Neill told reporters Wednesday morning. “That’s not how it’s supposed to go. It’s not how we train. ” The woman, Deborah Danner, had schizophrenia and police had visited her home on prior occasions for disturbances. According to police, they were responding to a call from a neighbor that Danner was acting in an “irrational manner” when the shooting occurred. Danner was holding a pair of scissors when sergeant Hugh Barry entered her residence, police said. Barry was able to convince Danner to put down the scissors and leave the home with him when she allegedly picked up a bat and began swinging it at the Sergeant’s head. Barry fired two shots from his service weapon, and Danner was taken to a nearby hospital where she was pronounced dead. Police said that Barry was equipped with a   Taser weapon, which he did not deploy. Barry has been placed on modified duty, and was stripped of his gun and badge while the incident is investigated by the NYPD’s force investigation division. Mayor Bill de Blasio called the shooting “tragic and unacceptable” in a Wednesday evening press conference, adding “it should never have happened. It’s as simple as that: it should never have happened. ” The mayor also commended the department for moving quickly to reassign the sergeant.  That move was ridiculed by Barry’s union, the NYPD sergeants benevolent association. President Ed Mullins called the shooting justified and said the decision to strip Barry of his badge was “politically motivated”. After what his office called a “rigorous review” New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman announced on Thursday that his office would not be reviewing the shooting, and that it would be left to the Bronx county district attorney to decide whether a crime had been committed. Schneiderman said that because Danner had a weapon, the incident fell outside of his authority to investigate. An executive order signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo after the death of Eric Garner gives the attorney general’s office the responsibly to make determinations about fatal police incidents in cases where the victim is unarmed.  Bronx borough president Ruben Diaz Jr called the incident “all too reminiscent” of the case of Eleanor Bumpurs, a Bronx woman, who like Danner was 66 and dealing with mental health issues, who was killed by NYPD officers in 1984. The officer in that case was charged with manslaughter and eventually acquitted. “While I certainly understand the hard work our police officers undertake to keep the streets of our city safe every single day, I also know what excessive force looks like,” Diaz said in a statement. The shooting highlights the danger that people with mental health issues often face when they become involved with police during moments of crisis. The Guardian’s   investigation into police killings has found that, nationwide, more than a quarter of all killings involve individuals with mental health issues.  Danner is the seventh person described as “emotionally disturbed” to be killed by NYPD officers in the last three years, according to the New York advocacy group Communities United for Police Reform. “No person in need of mental health services should end up dying like this,” said Donna Liebman, executive director of the New York ACLU. “The questions raised by such a disproportionate use of force are especially important in a context where across the country people are asking if law enforcement values enough the lives of people of color. ”   Danner is the 10th black woman to be killed by police in 2016 and the first since Korryn Gaines was killed by officers in Baltimore in a   August incident.

’It’s a crime to be young and pretty’: girls flee predatory Central America gangs
Sara Rincón was walking home from college in the capital of El Salvador when she was confronted by three heavily tattooed gang members who had been harassing her for weeks. The group’s leader  —   a man in his 30s, with the figure 18 etched on to his shaven head  —   threw her against a wall, and with his hands around her neck gave her one last warning. “He said no woman had ever turned him down, and if I refused to be his girlfriend, he would kill me and my family. I didn’t want to leave home but after that we couldn’t stay we left for Mexico in the middle of the night,” said Rincón, forcing a smile through her tears. Increasing numbers of women and girls are fleeing El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras amid mounting evidence that criminal gangs are systematically targeting adolescent girls as sexual slaves.  More than 20 years after peace deals were signed to end vicious conflicts between the region’s leftwing guerrillas and   dictatorships, the three countries of the   Northern Triangle are still struggling with the consequences of war.  Corrupt security forces, international drug cartels and warring street gangs have helped turn the Northern Triangle into the world’s most dangerous region outside an official war zone. And the threat of sexual violence against women and girls has become a growing factor behind the refugee crisis that is quietly unfolding on America’s doorstep. Of the 32, 142 female migrants detained by Mexican immigration agents in the first nine months of this year, almost one in three were under 18. Almost 15, 000   to    girls from Central America’s northern triangle  —   Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras  —   have been apprehended here since 2014. Forcing women and girls into sexual activities with gang members is prima facie evidence of modern slavery, according to Urmila Bhoola, the UN’s special rapporteur for contemporary slavery. “The forced recruitment of girls and young women into   activities, and especially being forced into prostitution through providing ‘conjugal visits’ to gang members in prison, are extreme forms of sexual exploitation and human degradation that involve exercising powers akin to the right of ownership over these individuals,” Bhoola said.  “Gangs reflect the deeply patriarchal power structures that prevail in this region,” she said. “It’s a problem affecting millions of women and girls. ” But it is a phenomenon that regional authorities still deny, according to Erika Guevara, the Americas director at Amnesty International. “Women and girls are living in a constant state of terror   …     treated as mere trophies in a ruthless war between gangs that largely control their countries. Authorities must invest some of the millions they are receiving to halt immigration in programmes to ensure these women are safe at home,” Guevara said. For Rincón, the nightmare started in March, when the leader of a local clica, or neighbourhood cell, of the Calle 18 street gang started targeting her.  “Every time I got on the bus he’d be there, shouting that I was his girlfriend. Then, he sent guys to watch me. If they saw me talking to male friends, they’d tell them to back off, so I stopped going to college,” said Rincón. In 2014 and 2015, at least 66, 000 girls in El Salvador changed or abandoned school, according to ministry of education figures, in a country of 6. 5 million people.  Rincón and her father fled north, and they are now sharing a tiny room in Tapachula, the biggest city on Mexico’s southern border, while they apply for refugee status.  But they could not afford the passage for the whole family, so her mother and five siblings are staying with relatives in another part of San Salvador  —   part of a growing wave of internally displaced people in the country. They escaped the immediate threat, but the whole family is deeply traumatised. Rincón is anxious and tearful  —   and she has started  . “It feels like I’m trapped. I miss my mum. Cutting myself feels like a release. I just want this all to end,” she said. She recently turned 18, and wants to finish high school. Her father Ricardo, 40, a shoe seller and evangelical pastor, recounts the ordeal in barely audible whispers and complains of a constant headache. He refuses to allow Rincón to make new friends because he is terrified the gang will track them down. Increasingly, entire families from the Northern Triangle are fleeing together, seeking to escape warring street gangs and corrupt security forces. Andrea Hernández, 17, is staying in one of Tapachula’s migrant shelters with eight members of her family. They fled Tegucigalpa, Honduras, one night in June, soon after Hernández was rescued from a gang kidnapping. She was abducted on her way to a sports field for a morning run, and held captive for a week by gang members who wanted to recruit her, according to her mother Isabel, 54. Andrea was rescued by the authorities after Isabel pleaded with a relative who works in the prosecutor’s office, but that was not the end of the ordeal: although the family begged officials not to make any arrests, they still feared retaliation from the gang.  The entire family  —   Hernández, her parents, her younger sister, 13, as well as her older sister, 28, and her husband and three children  —   fled the country.  “We left our dogs and cat, all my clothes, I couldn’t even say goodbye to my friends,” said Hernández. So far, she has barely spoken about her   ordeal at the hands of the kidnappers: “I can’t,” she said, turning her face to rub her eyes, “I’ve tried but I can’t. ” According to Isabel, her daughter cries at night, when she thinks the rest of the family is asleep. “She hardly eats, she’s traumatised, she’s not the same. My daughter was a model student in Honduras, she wanted to be an architect. Everything changed, for all of us, in one day,” said Isabel.   of the women interviewed by the UN refugee agency in 2015 described direct threats and attacks by members of criminal groups as a key reason for their flight.  But leaving home doesn’t guarantee safety, and there are growing reports that criminal groups and gangs are seeking out and targeting Central American migrants and refugees.  Soon after arriving in Tapachula in July, Andrea enrolled in a beauty course at another shelter. A month into the course, after a minor disagreement, two young Salvadorans told her she had five days to drop out or be killed. The family was forced to flee again. “If we’re not safe here either. Why can’t we go home?” said Hernández, before walking out of the room. “She doesn’t understand the dangers  —   we’re never going back,” said her mother.  Hernández and her family are also applying for refugee status in Mexico  —   part of a growing number of migrants seeking asylum here after a   crackdown launched in July 2014 made it much harder to reach the US.  Mexico’s refugee agency (Comar) has a local office on a quiet corner in Tapachula’s historic centre. It recently extended its opening hours to tackle growing demand, but new applicants must still queue early in the morning to be seen. Elena Cruz, 15, from San Salvador sat silently next to her mother Barbara, 39, clutching a folder of documents to show Comar.  She told a familiar story: a tattooed gang leader took a liking to Cruz. He started following her to and from school, and sending her threatening messages via a classmate. “It was always the same, ‘if you don’t go out with me, you won’t go out with anyone’,” said Cruz. “I want to be a doctor but I had to stop school. I was terrified to be in the house as he knows where we live. ” Cruz’s mother moved her four times to live with different relatives, but each time the gang tracked her down. “They would send me messages on Facebook telling me where I was, threatening to come and take me. ” Too scared to go to the police in case the gang found out, mother and daughter packed two suitcases, and fled in the middle of the night, abandoning their home and Barbara’s successful seafood market stall. “We’re seeking refuge because they’ll take my daughter or kill us if we go back,” said Barbara. “There’s no future in El Salvador, it’s now a crime for girls to be young and pretty. ”  Names have been changed to protect identities

Clinton: Trump’s economic plan will benefit rich, mine will create 10m jobs
In a fiery speech that sharply criticized her opponent’s economic vision for the US, Hillary Clinton said Donald Trump’s proposals will only benefit the rich, while destroying the economy in tandem. Speaking before hundreds of union workers and supporters on Thursday, Clinton positioned her plan as a boon for the middle class, with a pledge to curry support in Congress for the largest investment in “  jobs” since the second world war by rebuilding infrastructure across the nation. “We will put Americans to work, building and modernizing our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our railways, our ports, our airports,” she said. “We are way overdue for this, my friends. We are living off the investments that were made by our parents’ and grandparents’ generations. ” Trump’s plan, by contrast, doesn’t offer any “credible solutions to the very real economic challenges we face” she said. “He would give trillions in tax cuts to corporations   …     that would explode our national debt and eventually lead to massive cuts in priorities like education, healthcare and environmental protection,” Clinton said. Clinton’s campaign said her plan would add more than 10m jobs across the US. It would include employment opportunities for outgoing prison inmates and youth, as well as billions of dollars for infrastructure projects. Despite embracing a more upbeat view of the nation’s outlook compared to her opponent, Clinton noted that income inequality has continued to increase in recent years. “It is just too hard to get ahead today,” she said. “But there are commonsense things that your government can do that would give Americans more opportunities to succeed. Why don’t we do it? Because powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress have led to gridlock in Congress. ” Clinton’s   speech in   Michigan followed an economic policy rollout on Monday by her opponent  —   whose remarks in Detroit were interrupted more than a dozen times by protesters. Trump’s subdued speech (by his standards) took repeated shots at Clinton, in particular by saying her “failed” economic agenda is indicative of problems in Detroit, which emerged from municipal bankruptcy just under two years ago.  The former secretary of state vehemently pushed back against Trump on Thursday, saying his plan is a rehashed playbook of   economics, and will only benefit millionaires and billionaires. In particular, she dubbed one aspect of her opponent’s plan as the “Trump loophole”: a proposal to slash income taxes for corporations by more than half. “It would allow him to pay less than half the current tax rate in income for many of his companies,” she said. “He’d pay a lower rate than millions of middle class families. ” One analyst, she noted, said Trump’s plan would be a “really nice deal  —   for Donald Trump”. Trump’s proposal to eliminate the estate tax, which applies to estates larger than $5. 45m for individuals, would also shore up his family’s finances, Clinton said. “That alone would save the Trump family $4bn,” she claimed. “It would do nothing for 99. 8% of Americans. So they’d get a $4bn tax cut, and 99. 8% of Americans would get nothing. Just think of what we could do with those four billion. ” The Democratic nominee’s speech didn’t highlight new significant economic proposals, instead taking aim at Trump’s pledge for immense deregulation, including a temporary moratorium on federal agency rules. She said Trump’s plan would eliminate regulations that “stop polluters from poisoning the air our children breathe, and the water we drink”. In Michigan, the city of Flint has been reeling from a   water contamination crisis, an issue Clinton has repeatedly highlighted on the campaign trail this year. “Now there is a myth out there that he will stick it to the rich and powerful because, somehow, he’s really on the side of the little guy,” she said. “Don’t believe it. Not when he pledges to rip up basic rules that hold corporations accountable. ” She also hit back on Trump’s intense criticism to US trade deals supported by Barack Obama and former president Bill Clinton. “It is too often that past trade deals have been sold to the American people with rosy scenarios that did not pan out,” she said. But the answer, she added, isn’t to “rant or rave and cut ourselves off from the world”. “That would end up killing even more jobs the answer is to finally make trade work for us, not against us,” she said. “So my message to every worker in Michigan and across America is this: I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the   Partnership. ” Clinton’s trade remarks were, perhaps, the latest in a move to appeal to progressives who remain skeptical of her policy stances, following the exit of Senator Bernie Sanders from the Democratic presidential race. In public, Clinton’s support for the TPP has wavered since last fall, when she broke from the Obama administration and came out against the   deal. Still, last month, Clinton ally and Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe said he believes the candidate will support TPP, albeit with some changes.  Political observers viewed the stop in Macomb County  —   famous for producing   “Reagan Democrats” who propelled the former president’s candidacy in the 1980s  —   as a sign of Clinton mounting the beginnings of a competitive campaign in Michigan. Clinton showed signs of weakness in the primary, when Sanders dramatically won  by a   1. 5%. But local officials believe that, despite an expected close race in Michigan, Clinton has turned a corner. Ed Bruley, chairman of the Macomb County Democratic party, told the Detroit News that Clinton was “outworked in the primary but she’s making the right moves now” by focusing on the middle class and economic policies.  “I think it’s going to be close. I don’t think it’s a ” he told the newspaper of the   race in Macomb County. “But I think Clinton is doing the right stuff. By coming here, she’s demonstrating that she’s committed. ” Clinton opened up a near   lead on Trump in recent state polls. Clinton’s state campaign shouldn’t relax a moment, though, said Michigan’s former Democratic governor James Blanchard. “I once won an election by 70% and I didn’t know I was going to do that until the day after. I once lost an election by a quarter of a point and everyone told me I was going to win by 20. So you really have to be careful on polls,” Blanchard said.  The former governor and US congressman said the close primary race in Michigan with Sanders was a “good   call” for the Clinton campaign. “They didn’t really spend any time here,” Blanchard said. “I think the polls, again the polls showed a big lead. And the truth is the exit polls showed Hillary won with the Democrats by 15 points, but lost the independents. ”  Former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm is also working for the state campaign, and this week former Republican governor William Milliken endorsed Clinton.  Clinton’s speech on Thursday was held in the city of Warren at Futuramic Tool  Engineering, a manufacturing facility for the automotive and aerospace industries. Clinton highlighted aspects, she said, that “makes Michigan great”. “In Detroit, we’ve got new businesses opening,” she said, adding: “The auto industry just had its best year ever. Over in Ann Arbor   firms are thriving. ” At the Futuramic facility, she said, “you are on the frontlines of what I believe will be a true engineering renaissance in America”. Roughly 500 union workers and others attended the   speech. About a dozen Trump supporters gathered outside, carrying signs that read: “Hillary for Prison” and “I’m not ready for the next war”. Matt Vanderwest, a    operating engineer and lifelong Democrat from western Michigan, said Tuesday’s speech was the first political event he has ever attended. “This election is a pretty crucial one to be involved in,” he said. In the primary election, Vanderwest said he supported Sanders “for a while” but has since transferred over to Clinton. The decision was simple, he said. “The other side, I don’t believe, is for the middle class,” he said. “They say they are, but they aren’t. ” Willie Dubas, also an operating engineer from nearby Livingston County, agreed.  “Both the candidates talk about the middle class, but only one is going to look out for the interests for people like us,” Dubas, 38, said. “The other one talks about it to get the vote. “I think everything he says is unnerving,” Dubas said of Trump. “Whatever subject he’s talking about seems to have that effect on me. ”

Hillary Clinton ’healthy and fit to serve as president’, doctor says
Hillary Clinton is in “excellent mental condition” her doctor said in a letter released on Wednesday by the Democratic presidential candidate’s campaign, as focus on her health continues to escalate as she recuperates from pneumonia. “She continues to remain healthy and fit to serve as president of the United States,” physician Lisa Bardack wrote in the letter, which also gave new medical information. Bardack added that Clinton was “recovering well with antibiotics” namely Levaquin, which she was advised to take to treat the pneumonia for 10 days. “My overall impression is that Mrs Clinton has remained healthy and has not developed new medical conditions this year other than a sinus and ear infection and her recently diagnosed pneumonia. ”  Clinton’s health became an issue on Sunday when she abruptly left a   memorial ceremony at Ground Zero in New York. Video filmed by a passerby subsequently emerged showing her losing her footing as she got into her waiting car.  It was only then that her campaign confirmed she had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday, prompting aides to acknowledge they had mishandled communication on the subject. Clinton was forced to take a break from the campaign trail this week, canceling scheduled trips to California and Nevada. She is expected to return to the stump with a rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, on Thursday. The records released on Wednesday also note that Clinton, who is 68, has suffered from allergy   this year, “a typical pattern for most of her life”. She underwent a CT brain scan in March after a sinus and ear infection, but no abnormalities were found. She developed sinusitis (an inflammation of the sinuses) and an ear infection in January and was treated with antibiotics and steroids.  “The remainder of her complete physical exam was normal and she is in excellent mental condition,” Bardack wrote. Clinton’s health and wellbeing have long been at the center of an   conspiracy that she became seriously ill following a fall and concussion in 2012, with videos of Clinton falsely spliced together to make her condition look more serious. Republican nominee Donald Trump and surrogates such as former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani have seized on the conspiracies, declaring last month that Clinton “lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on Isis”.  Clinton takes the blood thinner Coumadin and thyroid medication, according to the new releases. But the blood clot she sustained four years ago was declared completely resolved in a   letter Clinton released from her personal physician last June, stating that she was “in excellent physical condition”. Trump, by contrast, released a   letter from his doctor in December that mostly engaged in hyperbole and declared him as the “healthiest individual ever elected” if successful in his pursuit of the White House. It did not, however, mention the foot problems that Trump claims excused him from the Vietnam war draft. Trump, who has thus far declined to release further medical information or his tax records, has since announced he would discuss his health in an appearance with Dr Oz. Trump, who is 70, will sit down with the television show host, who has long received flak from the medical community for plugging medical products with little scientific value, on Thursday. A clip released on Tuesday showed him handing over two letters to the TV doctor, Mehmet Oz.  Following the release of her health records, Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook said it was fair to say that more is now known about Hillary Clinton “than nearly anyone in public life”. “Hillary Clinton’s release of updated medical information today meets a standard followed by presidential candidates like Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. Additionally, Hillary has made public nearly 40 years of tax returns over her lifetime,” Mook said in a statement.  “In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hands down the least transparent presidential nominee in memory. His Doctor Oz charade is as completely unserious as his original joke of a letter written in five minutes. He continues to hide his taxes and business dealing behind fake excuses. And it begs the question: what is he trying to hide?” Tim Kaine, the Democratic   nominee, also released more details surrounding his health on Wednesday. The    senator was deemed in “excellent health” according to his doctor, and has faced only minor medical incidents such as molar extractions, a dislocated shoulder and a broken clavicle. Mike Pence, the Republican   nominee, reportedly ignored reporters’ attempts to determine whether he, too, would be disclosing his medical records. A spokesperson for the Indiana governor said he will soon release the results of a physical conducted this summer.

Syria talks involving US to take place this weekend, says Lavrov
An unexpected round of multilateral talks on the future of Syria is to start on Saturday involving initially Russia, the US, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and possibly Qatar, the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has said. The talks will be held in Lausanne, Switzerland. Lavrov told CNN he hoped that a meeting involving only those “with direct influence on the ground” in Syria would allow “a businesslike discussion, not another general assembly like debate”. It was not immediately clear whether Iran would be represented. The UK, France and other European states will be excluded from the Lausanne meeting, but the US secretary of state, John Kerry, is expected to brief European foreign ministers in London afterwards. Kerry announced he was ending bilateral contacts with Russia after a   brokered ceasefire broke down after less than a week, when the Syrian regime declared it over and resumed a   air offensive against   eastern Aleppo. However, the state department said at the time that multilateral meetings on Syria would continue, including Russia. The state department, announcing Kerry’s weekend talks, said tthe Lausanne and London talks were to “discuss a multilateral approach to resolving the crisis in Syria, including a sustained cessation of violence and the resumption of humanitarian aid deliveries”. The US, UK and France have called for Russia and the Syrian regime to be investigated for war crimes. President Vladimir Putin countered by shelving a 2000 deal on the disposal of   plutonium and cancelling a bilateral agreement on research cooperation between Russia and US nuclear sectors. In his CNN interview, Lavrov derided Boris Johnson who was the first official to publicly accuse Russia of taking part in the 19 September bombing of an UN aid convoy. Lavrov said the UK foreign secretary of arrogance and being a “Jack of all trades” going from being from a mayor and “a friend of Russia” to “getting ready to become to some kind of international recognised prosecutor general in the Hague. ” The Russian foreign minister claimed that Moscow was taking “all necessary precautions . .. to advise the Syrian army to be very specific and very targeted in its actions towards Nusra”.  Lavrov accused the former   Front, now known as Jabhat Fateh   thought to number about 1000, of using eastern Aleppo’s 275, 000 population as “human shields”. A French effort to secure a ceasefire agreement at the UN security council at the weekend was vetoed by Russia on the grounds there was no clear commitment that jihadi forces in eastern Aleppo would leave the city. The presence of Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar at the Lausanne meeting suggests there will be a focus on whether   Syrian opposition fighters are willing to disentangle themselves from   Front. Although   has changed its name, both the US and Russia believe the group has retained its links to   and must therefore be regarded as a proscribed group.  But many opposition fighters backed by the west will not break with  .  The UN has been trying to revive the ceasefire by proposing that 1, 000 or so of the jihadi group’s fighters be escorted from Aleppo to a safe place in return for a commitment from Moscow that Russian and Syrian air forces will cease airstrike and allow the delivery of humanitarian aid to the 250, 000 civilians in the city. On Tuesday, Putin cancelled a trip to Paris, accusing the French of trying to set up a Russian veto on Syria at the UN security council last weekend. France claimed the Russian president was embarrassed to talk about Syria. Western officials are increasingly convinced that Russia uses diplomatic negotiations as a cover to continue military activity in Syria and say that the west can no longer afford to believe Russia is seriously seeking a diplomatic solution instead of a military one. Diplomats believe a wider ceasefire in Syria  —   let alone peace talks to end the conflict  —   will not be considered unless there is an end to to the impasse over Aleppo. Separately there are   discussions under way on whether economic sanctions should be widened against Russia. Germany has previously been seen as one of the countries least eager to impose wider sanctions on Russia, but the issue is likely to be discussed at the next meeting of EU heads of state in Brussels on 20 October. In response to that sanctions threat, the speaker of Russia’s upper house of parliament, Valentina Matvienko, said: “Only the United Nations is authorised to impose sanctions in case of grave rights violations. All other sanctions, including those against Russia, are illegitimate and unlawful. ” The leaders of Russia, Germany, France and Ukraine are due to meet in an attempt to find a peace settlement in eastern Ukraine, one of the issues that has damaged Russian relations with Europe. The meeting will only go ahead, probably next Wednesday, if there is a sign that it will reach an agreement on the next stage of   set out in the Minsk agreement.

Yahoo’s Marissa Mayer is a reminder that CEO is still elusive for women
In the same week the United States gained its first female presidential nominee for a major political party, the country also lost one of its   female CEOs, with the announced $4. 8bn acquisition of Yahoo’s core assets by Verizon.  When  —   and it looks inevitable  —   Marissa Mayer steps down from Yahoo, she will lose her status as head of part of a tiny and elite group of women who head publicly traded companies.  Why has it been so tough for women to reach the role of CEO, whether of a company or of USA Inc? Admittedly, when it comes to the White House there are more hoops to jump through: it’s a single job, and candidates have to win the support of a majority of all Americans, in elections that happen once every four years.   Theoretically, at least, it should be simpler for women to reach the corner offices of US corporations. It has been decades since they donned a feminine version of business suits (remember those silk shirts with little bow ties at the neck? Or the jackets with the padded shoulders?) and set off to conquer corporate America.   But if you look at the data, women still remain eerily absent from the   running only 22 of the companies in the Fortune 500.  There has been progress, to be sure. Just as no one now can sneer at the idea that it’s impossible for a woman to run for president, or run a giant multinational corporation, the kind of companies these women head aren’t confined to the pink ghettos of consumer products. Yes, Sheri McCoy is CEO of Avon Products, the quintessential women’s products company, but Marillyn Hewson leads Lockheed Martin, an aerospace giant, while Mary Barra is CEO of General Motors.  But do women still get a fair shot at reaching that corner office? Do they get treated equally when they’re occupying it? Marissa Mayer would argue they don’t. In an interview with the Financial Times immediately after the announcement of Verizon’s acquisition of the business she had struggled for years to turn around, she hit out at what she claimed was “  reporting” by the media that dogged her efforts to lead the business. “We all see the things that only plague women leaders, like articles that focus on their appearance, like Hillary Clinton sporting a new pantsuit,” Mayer told the FT. Admittedly, Mayer has drawn a lot of attention for being pregnant and giving birth (not once, but twice) while a CEO  —   something that male CEOs simply don’t do, and that it’s very unusual for any female CEO to do, if only because a typical CEO is in their 40s. She has posed for Vogue  —   something few male CEOs are called on to do. (Though they have their counterparts, being featured in “CEO porn” shoots for Forbes Life, Maxim and other men’s magazines.)  But while Mayer may have chosen to gripe about what she at least sees as a gender bias in the way her behavior is scrutinized and analyzed, there are more substantive complaints that many CEOs (if not necessarily Mayer herself) might well raise about the kind of situation they face once in the corner office. Take executive pay, for instance. We’re all so accustomed to the idea that CEOs are lavishly overpaid, it may come as a surprise to realize that women who take on the role of CEO get much smaller reward when they do well, and are disproportionately punished if the value of the companies they lead suffers, according to a report published last year by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The Fed staffers who   the study discovered that for every $1m increase in the business, a male CEO received an extra $17, 150 in incentive compensation, but a woman got $1, 670. A 1% increase in the value of the company meant that a male CEO’s wealth soared 44% that of his female counterpart crept higher by 13%. A 1% decline in the value of the company meant that the incentive compensation of a female CEO fell by 63% that of a male CEO dropped by only a third. Researchers also have identified a phenomenon they have dubbed the “glass cliff”: an equivalent to the     glass ceiling. It refers to what happens when women are set up to fail: when they are appointed to take on leadership roles that have a greater risk of failure. One study suggests that this might be due to preconceptions about stereotypically “female” skills: when a company is in crisis, survey respondents seemed to believe that a talent for communication and the ability to encourage teamwork was more valuable than “male” abilities, like decisiveness and competitiveness. Certainly Mayer was taking on a troubled company: Yahoo, a pioneer of the early internet era, had been pushed to the fringes by newcomers like Google. Mayer was fighting to try and fight a new role and relevance for a large legacy organization. Did GM’s board name Mary Barra to the CEO post solely for her management talents? Well, partly, but when she took the helm, the company was in the midst of its own crisis, having been accused of covering up defects in its cars that contributed to deaths among drivers. Leading GM out of that mess and restoring its brand was a   job.  Certainly, the glass cliff may be contributing to the higher rate at which women CEOs fail   are ousted, even if it doesn’t completely explain it.  Mayer may not be a poster child for women CEOs. Ultimately, her turnaround strategy for Yahoo failed. And whenever she does decide to leave the combined   entity, she could walk away having earned $137m over the four years of her tenure, depending on the final terms of her severance agreement and the timing of her departure. (That figure includes cash compensation, shares that she owns, the value of stock options she already owns and future options grants and more shares she is entitled to under the terms of her employment agreement.) That is in spite of the fact that, while Yahoo’s stock trades at more than double the price it did at the time she took on the CEO role in   it has fallen more than 25% from its peak in late 2014. But it would be a shame if corporate directors looked at Mayer’s costly pay package and uneven record to justify or rationalize failing to consider women as candidates for the CEO role  —   or perhaps worse, to consider them only for the role of the “fall gal” setting them up to tumble over the glass cliff. After all, at least one study, by   Quantopian, compared the performance of the 80 companies in the Standard  Poor’s 500 index that were led by women CEOs between 2000 and 2014, and found that   companies generated a return of 348% while an investment in the SP 500 itself would have yielded only 122%.  Now in light of that kind of data, ignoring women as CEO candidates seems to me not only like a   lawsuit waiting to happen, but also bad business.

Comparing Nauru to Guantánamo Bay is ridiculous, says Australian immigration minister
Australia’s immigration minister, Peter Dutton, has rejected comparisons between the Nauru detention centre and Guantánamo Bay as a “ridiculous analogy” as the fallout from the publication of more than 2, 000 leaked incident reports continues. On Wednesday the Guardian published the Nauru files, which reveal in staggering detail the scale of abuse and trauma of children in Australian offshore detention. The publication of the files has led to renewed calls for a range of reforms of Australia’s policy of mandatory offshore detention for asylum seekers who have arrived by boat. The government has also faced growing international pressure over the release of the reports. Dutton has declined to respond to multiple requests for comment from the Guardian. But in a gruelling interview on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s 7. 30 program on Thursday night he faced heavy questioning about the files from Leigh Sales, including about whether the facility was turning into a “Guantánamo   situation”. Dutton said: “No, and with respect I think that’s a ridiculous analogy. I think the situation is that people have paid people smugglers for a migration outcome, they want to come to Australia. ” “It’s turning into a situation where people are making a choice that they don’t want to go back to their country of origin in cases where we’re offering thousands, literally thousands and thousands of dollars for people to return to their country of origin, to provide support. ” He reiterated earlier comments he had made that he would not tolerate sexual assaults or abuse on the detention centre. But he continued to play down the seriousness of the allegations contained in the Nauru files. “You’re talking about cases where children might not want to go to school, where children are complaining about conditions at the local park, the local beach. These form the basis of some of these complaints. ” The Guardian’s investigation revealed harrowing incidents, from a guard allegedly grabbing a boy and threatening to kill him once he was living in the community to guards allegedly slapping children in the face.  Dutton continued: “The point that I would make is that one representation of a child or a woman in any of these reports is one too many. ” He was also pressed on the differences in responses at Nauruan and Australian facilities. “There would be incident reports at detention centres here in Australia on a daily basis as there would be at schools, as there would be at correctional facilities, they are investigated and there is an obligation on the contractors on Nauru to report every instance,” he said. Dutton also faced questions about the differences between the Australian government’s swift decision to establish a royal commission into the juvenile detention system in the Northern Territory and the comparatively muted response to the release of the Nauru documents. Dutton responded: “There are considerable differences   …     Nauru is not part of Australia, so this is an issue for the Nauruan government. ”

Tennessee wildfires kill three and force thousands to evacuate
The national guard has been called in to aid with wildfires tearing through forests in Tennessee that have killed three people, according to Sevier County mayor Larry Waters, forcing thousands to evacuate and left many without power on Tuesday, local emergency responders said. Firefighters were working early on Tuesday to put out a fire that worsened overnight and affected 100 homes near the eastern Tennessee city of Gatlinburg, according to officials. “If you’re a person of prayer, we could use your prayers,” Gatlinburg’s fire chief, Greg Miller, said on Monday evening. The fire was fanned overnight by winds up to 87mph and extremely dry conditions due to an ongoing drought across the south, but firefighters were hopeful that an oncoming storm could provide some   relief. However, experts predicted rains on Tuesday from one storm system would not be enough to end the drought. Officials say the wildfire has set 30 structures ablaze in Gatlinburg, including a   hotel. Waters said on Tuesday afternoon that he didn’t have any details on the deaths. The mayor says authorities are going door to door to make sure everyone is safe. About a dozen people have been injured.   The Tennessee emergency management agency (Tema) Emergency officials ordered evacuations in downtown Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge and other areas of Sevier County near the Great Smoky Mountains. About 14, 000 residents and visitors were evacuated from Gatlinburg alone. There were about 1, 200 people sheltering at the Gatlinburg Community Center and the Rocky Top Sports Park, officials added. Meanwhile, about 12, 000 people were without power and three school systems had canceled classes on Tuesday. At least a dozen people were taken to hospitals, including some with burns. No deaths were reported and officials said they had not received any reports of missing people. The news of the fire struck home for people across the state as Gatlinburg is a popular vacation destination for Tennesseans. Jenni Dusky, from Springfield, Tennessee, had her honeymoon in Gatlinburg and her parents were married there. The chapel they were married in was lost in the fire, she said. “We have a lot of family memories from there,” Dusky said. “[Gatlinburg] is a very important part of our culture and the pride we have in our state. ” The news of the fire brought her    son to tears, as like many families from middle Tennessee, they often travelled to Gatlinburg, to the national park, or the Dollywood theme park for family trips.  The wildfire started on Monday afternoon in Great Smoky Mountains national park, fanned by strong gusts and further exacerbated as falling trees took down power lines which ignited more flames.  The fire reached the local Dollywood theme park, in the east Tennessee town of Pigeon Forge, and guests in neighboring cabins were forced to evacuate. Dolly Parton had appeared in a video on Sunday, promoted by the National Park Service, calling for people to prevent fires by observing burn bans and reporting fires.  Parton is a native of Sevier County, Tennessee, which includes Gatlinburg and nearby Pigeon Forge, according to historical documents on the park’s website. In the   Parton partnered with the Herschend family who ran the park, then known as Silver Dollar City. It opened under the new name of Dollywood in 1986.  East Tennessee Red Cross called on people to avoid Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge and the Smoky Mountains area as emergency services evacuated those towns. Employees of the Ripley’s Aquarium of the Smokies in Gatlinburg were also evacuated, local news outlet WATE reported, and the aquarium reportedly took safety measures to ensure the animals inside were not affected by smoke inhalation. Ryan DeSears, general manager of the aquarium, told   that workers were anxious to return to check on the wellbeing of the 10, 518 animals. Based on preliminary surveys, the Westgate Smoky Mountain Resort  Spa in Gatlinburg “is likely entirely gone” Tema said in a news release. The agency had previously said it had reports that the Ober Gatlinburg amusement park and ski area had been destroyed as well, but resort officials checked in and said the property was fine. Wildfires have also been raging over the past two days in Georgia and North Carolina, which have experienced similarly dry conditions.

Aleppo, Ukraine, cyber attacks, Baltic threats: what should we do about Putin?
Boris Johnson’s suggestion that Britain, the US and other allies are   “military options” in Syria has sharply focused minds on a phenomenon western politicians have spent the last 15 years trying not to think about:   Russia’s determined drive to   itself as a major global power and the willingness of its ruthless and tactically astute leader, Vladimir Putin, to employ almost any means, including use of force, to achieve that end. The foreign secretary’s remarks were condemned by Moscow as an attempt to whip up   “hysteria” and were swiftly disowned by a nervous Downing Street. Johnson’s call for demonstrations outside Russia’s London embassy invited similar, retaliatory action against British interests in Moscow. The gaffe underlined his inexperience and lack of judgment. But on Syria’s plight, and particularly on war crimes allegedly committed during the relentless “pulverising” of Aleppo, Johnson had a point. His comments served to highlight the much bigger strategic, security and diplomatic problem: what to do about Russia. Military options are indeed being discussed again in Washington, from where Britain usually takes its cue. The key question is no longer how best to remove the Syrian dictator, Bashar  . It is how to stop the Russian military, Assad’s main backer, which is held responsible, directly or indirectly, for numerous lethal aerial attacks against civilians, hospitals and schools, including last month’s destruction of a UN aid convoy. So furious was John Kerry, the US secretary of state, at what he saw as Moscow’s deliberate sabotage of the latest Syria ceasefire that he broke off bilateral talks with Moscow. Samantha Power, US ambassador to the UN, accused Russia of “barbarism”. But repeating a pattern of behaviour familiar in Ukraine, Georgia and other crises, an unabashed Putin refused to back down. On the contrary, he rapidly upped the ante. Within days of Kerry’s move and official leaks that the White House was considering cruise missile strikes on Syrian military airstrips, the Russian defence ministry warned that Russia had deployed advanced   and      missiles in Syria. Any US bombing raids would be deemed threatening to Russian military personnel, who would respond accordingly. Moscow also doubled supplies to the Assad regime’s war effort. Almost simultaneously, Putin scrapped a   agreement to reprocess excess plutonium to prevent its use in nuclear weapons and two other nuclear cooperation agreements. The deployment of       missiles in Kaliningrad, the Russian enclave in eastern Europe bordering Nato members Poland and Lithuania, was confirmed. And, not coincidentally perhaps, massive civil defence exercises were held inside Russia, in apparent preparation for a nuclear war. Just in case Washington had not understood how serious Russia was, officials also declared Putin was considering reopening military bases in Cuba and Vietnam. It is hard to think of a more defiant, taunting message to the Obama administration than conjuring the spectre of a new Cuban missile crisis. Demonstrating that Moscow has other strategic partnerships that could be turned against Washington, Russian ships joined military exercises with China around the disputed South China Sea islands. It is also busily building up alliances with emerging powers such as South Africa and India, notably at this weekend’s Brics summit in Goa, while courting traditional American allies such as Turkey and the Philippines. Sergei Lavrov, Putin’s veteran foreign minister, was blunt. Russia would not be told what to do. Like it or not, it was once again a global force to be reckoned with. “Washington. .. cannot use the language of force, sanctions and ultimatums with Russia while continuing to selectively cooperate with our country only when it benefits the US,” he said. Last week, Putin himself took to the airwaves to deliver a similar message. Responding to a formal accusation by the US government that Moscow had launched a cyber   campaign to “interfere with the US election process” Putin denied he was trying to help the Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump. “They started this hysteria, saying this [hacking] is in Russia’s interests, but this has nothing to do with Russia’s interests,” Putin said. His government would work with whoever won the election “if, of course, the new US leader wishes to work with our country”. This latter statement was chilling. Putin was plainly saying that Russia, no longer the   economic and military   it briefly became under his predecessor Boris Yeltsin, does not need or seek American approval or agreement to take action in its own interests in Syria or anywhere else. If Barack Obama or his successor want to do business in future, then Russia must be treated as a global equal, not as an irritant or a spoiler or mere regional actor. Such assertions flatly contradict Washington’s preferred narrative, namely that the west “won” the cold war and Russia is no longer a great power. Hence, perhaps, American slowness to come to terms with a changed situation. But the grave implications of unravelling   relations are slowly sinking in across Europe, as always the nervous pig stuck in the middle. The German magazine Spiegel recently suggested that Syria was the most prominent battlefront in a new global war, more perilous even than the Cold War because the old power structures and rules are no longer in place. Yet any sort of western consensus over what to do about Russia remains elusive. Opinion is divided in Europe, where many countries are dependent on Russian energy supplies. Germany’s Social Democrats, for example, oppose sanctions on Moscow in addition to those imposed after Putin’s 2014 annexation of Crimea. Poland and the Baltic states, threatened by the Kaliningrad deployment and border troop   demand a more muscular Nato stance. Neutral Finland and Sweden, troubled by Russian air and sea incursions, edge ever closer to the western alliance. The   Minsk group is due to make another attempt to advance a Ukraine settlement. But nobody is optimistic the situation there is steadily deteriorating. Following the   cancellation last week of Putin’s visit to France, EU heads of state are also due to meet on Thursday with   sanctions against Russia on the agenda. This, too, may prove a  . In Britain, meanwhile, as Johnson splutters impotently and contradicts himself over   zones, the Labour party claims against all known facts that there is some kind of equivalence between Russian and US actions in Syria. If opposition fighters vacate Aleppo (handing victory to Assad) Labour suggests, all will be well. Its script could have been written by the Kremlin. The challenge presented by Russia is one of the biggest facing the next US president. Some analysts say Putin is taking advantage of Obama’s lame duck status to create “facts on the ground” in Syria. The Russian president is said to anticipate a further deterioration in bilateral relations if Hillary Clinton wins. The two have a history of personal dislike, dating back to Clinton’s time as secretary of state. “She says she sees in him a     KGB agent and a bully he remembers how she appeared to encourage street protests against him in 2011,” said analyst Leonid Bershidsky. Speaking in August, Clinton described Putin as “the grand godfather of this global brand of extreme nationalism”  —   lumping him with Trump, German   xenophobes and   populists such as France’s Marine Le Pen. Assuming Trump loses, a Clinton administration has three possible courses of action. One is to acknowledge Putin has a fair case when he argues that the US, the EU and Nato ignored or trampled on Russia’s interests in the   era, accept that Crimea is lost and that Assad stays in power for the time being, and focus in future on pragmatic,   “transactional” deals where interests coincide. A second approach is a   variation on the first, containing Russia wherever possible, maintaining or toughening sanctions, and waiting for the departure of Putin and what some economists say will be Russia’s inevitable economic collapse as its oil and gas runs out and international ostracism, corruption and a declining   population take their toll. The plan would be to   relations (again) with a   “new Russia”. The third possibility, and one that seems most likely at this point given Clinton’s policy positions, is that the US will move on to the front foot and purposefully confront Russia directly, not only in Syria but on a number of other areas, backed up by the possible use of military force. This prospect is fraught with danger, especially since Putin has shown repeatedly that he reacts badly to diktats and threats. When cornered, Putin does not back down. He escalates. He does not have a domestic electorate, critical parliament or independent media scrutiny to worry about. He disdains international opinion and international law. Despite last month’s   Kerry and Lavrov met again on Saturday to try to agree another Syria ceasefire. But a lasting solution looks as far away as ever. If the past 15 years show anything, it is that Putin, like a marauding Red Army tank, has no reverse gear. Much in the Middle East, Europe and beyond now rides on what an untested Clinton, with an awful lot to prove, decides is the best way forward. Barack Obama’s decision not to intervene militarily after Bashar   used chemical weapons left the door open for Russia. By going to the aid of his   ally Assad, Putin saw a chance to expand Russian influence in the Middle East at American expense and secure military bases on Syria’s Mediterranean coast. Fighting Islamic State terrorism was a secondary consideration. The US insists Assad must go, but its limited commitment so far means the   opposition continues to struggle while civilians bear the brunt of the violence. Despite the   imposition of international sanctions on Russia, Putin shows no sign of reversing his 2014 annexation of Crimea. Moscow’s    support for separatists in eastern Ukraine opposing the   government in Kiev continues unabated, with renewed fighting reported last week. Peace efforts led by Germany in the   Minsk group have stalled. Given the US believes it is upholding an important principle of international law, a future Clinton administration is unlikely to recognise   “facts on, the ground”. The deployment of Russian   missiles in Kaliningrad, the isolated enclave it controls on Poland’s and Lithuania’s border, is the latest move in a war of nerves along Europe’s eastern flank. The Baltic sea has also become a contested area as Russian submarines and aircraft test western reactions. Nato has beefed up its defences, and Britain has pledged its support. But the uncomfortable question remains: would an American president, go to war to defend Estonia? The US has formally accused Russia of launching a hacking campaign to disrupt the American presidential electoral process. The suspicion is that Putin, who has been praised by Donald Trump, wants Hillary Clinton defeated and the credibility of the election result put in doubt. Trump has already claimed the poll is fixed against him. Putin denies involvement. But the affair resembles previous cyber attacks on countries that were blamed on   Russian hackers. The US and Putin’s Russia have clashed repeatedly in the UN Security Council, most recently over Moscow’s veto of a resolution demanding an immediate halt to the bombing of Aleppo. The standoff has raised wider concerns about the effectiveness of the UN system when permanent members appear permanently at odds and its aid convoys are blown up. Russia is accused by the US of ignoring international law and of possible war crimes, and there are moves to refer it to the International Criminal Court.

’A powerful moment’: first US-to-Cuba flight since 1961 is latest step in thaw
To the lively beat of a salsa band, and with a water cannon   from airport fire trucks, the first commercial flight between the US and Cuba since 1961 took off from Florida on Wednesday, a symbolic next step in the new era of détente between the former cold war adversaries. Among the passengers aboard JetBlue flight 387 from Fort Lauderdale to Santa Clara were many Cuban exiles returning to their homeland for the first time in years, and the US transport secretary, Anthony Foxx, headed for talks with his counterparts in Havana. Wednesday’s historic flight, which took off 20 minutes late at 10. 05am after a lengthy party at the departure gate, will eventually lead to 110 flights to and from Cuba daily from the US. Foxx said he was expecting to announce the first dates for Havana later in the day. But for many of the passengers heading for the central Cuban city of Santa Clara on Wednesday, the journey was a celebration of the newfound personal freedoms the return of scheduled flights has brought, including the ability for travellers to book their own flights online at less than half the cost of the charter airlines who have been the mainstay of fractured travel links between the nations for the past 15 years. Among the first passengers to board was Nimaris   with fiance Mario Martínez and their two daughters, Daniella, three, and Olivia, 10 months. As a young girl in Sagua La Grande, González always dreamed of one day getting married in the tiny village church near her family’s home, but gave up on the idea when she left Cuba for Florida as a teenager 13 years ago. It will be a busy weeklong trip for González, a surgery nurse in Orlando. She will celebrate her 30th birthday tonight with her younger brother, whom she has not seen for 12 years, and on Thursday the couple will finally get their marriage ceremony in a Cuban church. “I always wanted to get married in the church I grew up in, and our children will be baptised there on the same day, so it’s a very emotional time,” González said. “The trip was sort of a birthday present, and for it to be on this flight today makes it more special. ” Martínez, 28, was born in Santa Clara but moved to central Florida with his parents as a child and has not been able to go home to visit his grandmother since 2004. “It’s freedom for us in that we no longer have to go to agents where they charge $500 for a ticket,” he said. “It’s good to see the relationship moving forward and travel opening up, but things in Cuba don’t change much. ” Jet Blue is one of a handful of   airlines who won approval from the state department to operate to and from Cuba earlier this year following the signing of a memorandum of understanding with the government in Havana. It also offers flights to Camaguey and Holguín and hopes to add daily flights to Havana shortly. American Airlines, meanwhile, begins scheduled services from Miami, home to Florida’s largest concentration of Cuban Americans, on 7 September. The airlines hope to cash in on a surge in visitors to Cuba from the US, which grew to 161, 000 in 2015, a 77% increase over the previous year according to government figures. Yet although the skies are reopening for the first time since the US broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1961, two years after Fidel Castro’s communist revolution, Barack Obama has been unable to persuade Congress to lift the   trade embargo. To the Cuban government’s chagrin, American citizens booking tickets must fall into one of 12 narrowly defined categories, including travel for religious, educational or cultural reasons. “This process of establishing regular flights is a step although the restrictions of the blockade remain, which among other things impede US citizens from travelling to our country as tourists,” the Cuban foreign minister, Eduardo Rodríguez Padilla, told reporters on Monday at a press conference in Havana. In an interview with the Guardian on Wednesday, Foxx said the Obama administration was working hard on continuing to bring down the barriers, a process announced publicly in December 2014 after months of secret talks with Cuban officials. “Today is one of the most tangible examples of the president’s vision for restored diplomatic relations with Cuba,” Foxx said. “This is part of a larger objective we have right now to really nudge Cuba towards progress in the 21st century, economically, politically and on so many other fronts. ” Foxx said he planned to announce later on Wednesday the “slot allocations” to Havana for US airlines after a meeting with Rodríguez Padilla. “There are a few other areas we will explore on the transportation connections between the two countries and creating better access in the longer term. ” The restoration of air links follows the historic docking in Havana in May of the Carnival cruise ship Adonia, the first such voyage in five decades, carrying more than 700 passengers. Passenger Julio César Valdés, also from Santa Clara, was looking forward to reuniting with his parents Teresa and Osnedo at his childhood home, and spending time with his    sister. “It’s a very emotional and wonderful day,” said Valdés, a medical assistant who lives in Jacksonville, Florida. “This is a new step in relations between the US and Cuba and I hope to see it progress further. ”   dentist Edelio González, 52, who has lived in south Florida for 36 years, said he has travelled regularly on charter flights to Santa Clara since 2001, but feels that today’s flight was “a powerful moment”. “The first flight in more than 50 years is just historic,” said González, who will spend a week with his    sister. “I wanted to be here. ”

La La Land tipped for Oscars glory after win at Toronto film festival
La La Land has taken the top honour at the Toronto film festival. The Los   musical world premiered on the opening night film of the Venice film festival and screened in Telluride, before debuting in Toronto. The movie   Damien Chazelle’s third   has attracted raves from reviewers, with especial praise for Emma Stone’s performance as a struggling actor, whose relationship to her jazz pianist boyfriend (Ryan Gosling) becomes strained when his career begins to overtake hers. Stone was named best actress at last Saturday’s Venice film festival awards. The film is the   by Chazelle, 31, to   drumming drama Whiplash, which won three Oscars, including best supporting actor for JK Simmons. La La Land is his second musical, following Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench, a     jazz musical, originally planned as his thesis project for Harvard Film School (he briefly left Harvard to focus on finishing the film).  “La La Land is about the city I live in, it’s about the music that I grew up playing, it’s about movies that I grew up watching,” Chazelle told the Guardian in Telluride, before screening it in Toronto. “Even the big spectacle of the movie feels private to me in that way. ” The People’s Choice Award is a proven indicator for future awards glory: past winners which have proceeded to the bag the best picture Oscar include Slumdog Millionaire, The King’s Speech and 12 Years a Slave. The   for this year’s prize was Garth Davis’s directorial debut, Lion, starring Dev Patel as a young man adopted as a child who uses Google Maps to track down the family he left in India. The inspirational and   story also stars Nicole Kidman and Rooney Mara. Another   drama, Mira Nair’s Queen of Katwe, about a    Ugandan girl who trains to become a world chess champion, took third place. The juried Platform award, established last year to celebrate international auteurs, went to Pablo Larraín’s Jackie, starring Natalie Portman as Jacqueline Kennedy, and unfolding shortly before and after her husband’s assassination. Brian De Palma,   Haroun and Zhang Ziy, who ruled on the prize, said: “Our decision was unanimous. We found one film that combined an extraordinary script with precise direction and unforgettable acting. ” The prize comes with a $25, 000 prize  —   $10, 000 more than the main winner receives. Ben Wheatley’s Free Fire, a     comedy starring Brie Larson and Armie Hammer, won the equivalent of the People’s Choice Award for the Midnight Madness sidebar   a lineup comprised of genre films. The second runner up for the award went to Julia Ducournau’s cannibal thriller Raw, which caused some audience members to faint at its Toronto premiere.

England in disarray as quest for next manager begins after bizarre campaign
These are the moments when the mind goes back to one of the sketches that has formed part of Henning Wehn’s   routine since the last World Cup. There are not many Germans on the comedy circuit in England and Wehn used to have a replica of the trophy to bring out on stage. Back home, he would explain, everyone had one. And then he would hold it towards his audience, teasing them, with a tone to his voice that reminded everyone which nation coined the term schadenfreude. “This,” he said, “is the closest you will ever get to it. ” He might be right bearing in mind a country that likes to think of itself as football royalty has won only six knockout matches in tournaments since 1966. The last occasion was 10 years ago against Ecuador. Before that it was Denmark in 2002, Spain (on penalties) at Euro 96, Belgium and Cameroon in 1990 and Paraguay in 1986. England might have invented the game but a look at their record over the last 50 years shows it is an awfully long time since they saw any royalties. The latest ordeal might be the most grievous of the lot and, once again, it is difficult not to marvel at the pomposity of a nation that has a clock on the wall of its football operation, St George’s Park, noting the day England apparently win the 2022 World Cup. The most noteworthy part of Martin Glenn’s press conference was the Football Association’s chief executive introducing himself as the man who would help find England’s new manager, then reminding us, twice, he was “no football expert”. Glenn’s performance did not bode well and it turns out Hodgson was so convinced his team would be in the   on Sunday that he had already arranged for his wife to fly to Paris. Hodgson, to give him his due, is not an easy man to pin arrogance on and, however joyless the football at times, it was not easy sitting across the table from him at Les Fontaines, looking into the eyes of someone who had not slept and seeing,   his suffering. “I’m very raw, I’m very fragile,” he said. His three top buttons were undone. He spent 10 minutes clawing the top of his hand as if troubled by a nervous tic. His first words were confused and defensive  —   “I don’t know why I am here”  —   and it turned out the FA asked him four times before he agreed he should front up. Hodgson looked as if he would rather be anywhere else. He was grey, perspiring, broken. His fingernails were bitten to the quick. “I don’t remember Roberto Martínez holding a major conference when he left Everton,” he complained. In happier times those of us who witnessed this personal devastation might actually miss Hodgson’s easy manner, the quaint references to “the mass media” and the way some of his answers tended to be longer than one of Neil Young’s guitar solos. His players liked his idiosyncrasies, the floral language and even his capacity, as one confided recently, to “go nuts” if something annoyed him (one example: finding out Wales had gone above England in the Fifa rankings). The team’s failings could not be attributed to   disharmony and it would be a surprise if the players were to start chopping him down in absentia in the way that happened to Fabio Capello, Steve McClaren and a few others. Equally, managers can have spells of good and bad form, just like players, and there are a couple of stories from the last few weeks that show Hodgson might have peaked too early with that friendly win against Germany in March. For starters there is the strange case of Harry Kane and who should be taking England’s corners. Kane was handed the role before the tournament and Hodgson was indignant when it was put to him that the Premier League’s leading scorer would be better off in the penalty area. “I don’t need to apologise for Harry Kane taking a corner,” he argued. “Kane is the best striker of the ball we have. He’s the one who gives us the best delivery. We’ve tried many other players and we don’t get the same level of delivery as we get from Harry. We believe the best chance of scoring a goal is by the delivery and you can prove that with research. ” The players, however, plainly did not agree, bearing in mind that in the following match against Wales it was Wayne Rooney who went across to take the first corner. Hodgson was so startled he came out of the dugout and his body language was of a man wanting to know what was going on. Kane went into the middle, Rooney swung the ball over and Hodgson looked entirely nonplussed. It could not be described as a mutiny but it was as close to one as anything else that happened in the Hodgson era. Do not be fooled either by the players, with their media training, saying they understood Hodgson’s reasons for making half a dozen changes for the goalless draw against Slovakia when England had the chance to win Group B. The truth is that lots of them could not see the logic and nobody more so than Rooney. The first Rooney knew about it was when Hodgson announced the team. There was no private explanation and Rooney could probably be forgiven for thinking, as captain, that he was entitled to one. Rooney will now be consulted about the new manager. Indeed, a lot of people will be, judging by Glenn’s admission that the FA needed help: “We are going to use the opinions, wisdom and insight of current managers, former managers and the same with players. ” Gary Lineker will be one. Hodgson himself might be asked, and Gary Neville too, but the decision will ultimately be taken by Glenn along with the FA   David Gill, and technical director, Dan Ashworth. Gill was a chartered accountant before becoming chief executive of Manchester United. He, like Glenn, has never hired a manager, though Ashworth did help to bring Roberto Di Matteo, Hodgson and Steve Clarke to West Bromwich Albion. “We kick off the process with the three of us,” Glenn said. “It’s the old joke: ‘what’s a camel?’ It’s a horse designed by committee. If we get 55 people involved . . . ” Glenn, one imagines, would get on well with Garry Cook, the former Manchester City chief executive. The FA is promising a “definitive review” of what went wrong but it is not just the football it needs to address and the   question about why players find exhilarating highs with their clubs but excruciating lows for their country. With England, it is more than that: the   press conferences, the extraordinary coddling of the players, the jarring sense it is better fun elsewhere and that the players are spoilt in the extreme. England’s players stayed at the £   Auberge du Jeu de Paume, a hotel with two Michelin stars that is described as “the epitome of French finesse and art de vivre” but there was still a complaint on the first night that the duvets could be plumper. The players’ idea of fun was to take turns carrying round a cuddly lion that had its own accreditation lanyard indicating its name was Kit. One photograph showed Hodgson in conversation with Jack Wilshere on the pitch in   before the Slovakia game. Wilshere had Kit strapped to his back and it was tempting to wonder what might have happened if anyone had tried this kind of PR gimmickry with, say, Sir Alex Ferguson or Brian Clough. A swift jab in the privates from Cloughie, almost certainly. But this is the weird and wacky world the FA would ideally like Arsène Wenger to explore when his contract at Arsenal runs down next year, with Gareth Southgate taking over in the meantime, it appears, for little reason other than the fact he is already on the FA’s payroll. No other country in Euro 2016 stops its officials staying in the same hotel and forbids them from eating with the players because the coaching staff prefer it that way. No team bar England has a set of players who are given their lines, like homework, before interviews instead of being trusted to talk for themselves. Nobody else has made one of Euro 2016’s training grounds look like a woodland prison, surrounded by   fences, police lookouts and flying drones. Covering England, one quickly learns there are rules in place. Players were told not to mention anything that related to their clubs or talk about opposition players. This is how silly it became: the players were even under orders not to discuss their   dart tournaments. Whose idea was Kit? “Senior players,” came the FA’s stock answer. Only a little thing, perhaps, but just compare the secrecy surrounding a cuddly toy with the way players from other teams hold themselves in front of the cameras. These issues might not matter if Hodgson’s reign had not been brought to its knees with three wins in his 11 tournament matches and a humiliation, ultimately, that a man who has devoted himself to this profession since 1976 will never live down. Likewise, it probably looks even worse in hindsight that Hodgson and his assistant, Ray Lewington, went sightseeing in Paris on the day Iceland played Austria, visiting Notre Dame and taking a boat ride along the Seine, but chose not to make a personal check on the game that would yield England’s opponents. Hodgson described it as “laughable” that this would be questioned when Gary Neville and four other members of staff were at the game and could report back. Others might apply the same word to the fact England’s delegation apparently jumped from their seats and punched the air when Iceland scored the   winner that meant Hodgson’s team facing the smallest nation in the tournament. Is it any wonder sometimes that the rest of Europe thinks of English football as far too haughty, full of   and entitlement? Alan Shearer, meanwhile, presents himself as the saviour, complaining that he should have been given the job after Fabio Capello and actually sounding as if he means it. Someone presumably might have to let Shearer know that it is going to be a hard sell. And, besides, Glenn sounds as if he is getting the idea. “It has to be the best man or woman for the job more likely a man,” the former biscuit company boss concluded.

Typecast as a terrorist
To begin with, auditions taught me to get through airports. In the end, it was the other way around. I’m an actor. Since I was a teenager I have had to play different characters, negotiating the cultural expectations of a Pakistani family,   rudeboy culture, and a scholarship to private school. The fluidity of my own personal identity on any given day was further compounded by the changing labels assigned to Asians in general. As children in the 1980s, when my brother and I were stopped near our home by a skinhead who decided to put a knife to my brother’s throat, we were black. A decade later, the knife to my throat was held by another “Paki” a label we wore with swagger in the   youth and gang culture of the 1990s. The next time I found myself as helplessly cornered, it was in a windowless room at Luton airport. My arm was in a painful   and my collar pinned to the wall by British intelligence officers. It was “post  ” and I was now labelled a Muslim.  Membership Event: The Long Read live at the Hospital Club  As a minority, no sooner do you learn to polish and cherish one chip on your shoulder than it’s taken off you and swapped for another. The jewellery of your struggles is forever on loan, like the    diamond in the crown jewels. You are intermittently handed a necklace of labels to hang around your neck, neither of your choosing nor making, both constricting and decorative. Part of the reason I became an actor was the promise that I might be able to help stretch these necklaces, and that the teenage version of myself might breathe a little easier as a result. If the films I   as a kid could humanise mutants and aliens, maybe there was hope for us. But portrayals of ethnic minorities worked in stages, I realised, so I’d have to strap in for a long ride. Stage one is the   stereotype  —   the minicab    owner. It tightens the necklace. Stage two is the subversive portrayal, taking place on “ethnic” terrain but aiming to challenge existing stereotypes. It loosens the necklace. And stage three is the Promised Land, where you play a character whose story is not intrinsically linked to his race. There, I am not a terror suspect, nor a victim of forced marriage. There, my name might even be Dave. In this place, there is no necklace. I started acting professionally during the    boom for   stereotypes, but I avoided them at the behest of my    self. Luckily, there was also a tiny speck of stage two stuff taking shape, subverting those same stereotypes, and I managed to get in on the act. My first film was in this mode, Michael Winterbottom’s The Road to Guantánamo. It told the story of a group of friends from Birmingham who were illegally imprisoned and tortured in the US detainment camp. When it won a prestigious award at the Berlin film festival, we were euphoric. For those who saw it, the inmates went from orange jumpsuits to human beings. But airport security did not get the memo. Returning to the glamour of Luton Airport after our festival win, ironically named British intelligence officers frogmarched me to an unmarked room where they insulted, threatened, and then attacked me. “What kinda film you making? Did you become an actor to further the Muslim struggle?” an officer screamed, twisting my arm to the point of snapping. The question is disturbing not only because it endangers artistic expression, but because it suggests our security services don’t quite grasp the nature of the terror threat we all face. A training presentation outlining  ’s penchant for “theatrical” attacks may have been taken a little literally.  It turned out that what those special branch officers did was illegal. I was asked by activist lawyers if I wanted to sue, but instead I wrote an account of the incident and sent it to a few journalists. A story about the illegal detention of the actors from a film about illegal detention turned out to be too good to ignore. I was glad to shed some light on this depressing state of affairs. I went on to write a song inspired by the incident, titled Post   Blues. It was full of sage advice, such as: “We’re all suspects so watch your back   I farted and got arrested for a chemical attack. ” The song got the attention of Chris Morris, who cast me in Four Lions. In the end, having my arm nearly torn off by people whose salary I pay led to me exploring loads of stage two work  —   loosening the necklace. It felt good, but what about stage three, the Promised Land? It turned out that there was no clear pathway for an actor of colour in the UK to go to stage three  —   to play “just a bloke”. Producers all said they wanted to work with me, but they had nothing I could feasibly act in. The stories that needed to be told in the multicultural   were about the     it seemed. I heard rumours that the Promised Land was not in Britain at all, but in Hollywood. The reason for this is simple. America uses its stories to export a myth of itself, just like the UK. The reality of Britain is vibrant multiculturalism, but the myth we export is an   world of lords and ladies. Conversely, American society is pretty segregated, but the myth it exports is of a racial   everyone solving crimes and fighting aliens side by side. So America was where I headed. But it would not be an easy journey. You see, the pitfalls of the audition room and the airport interrogation room are the same. They are places where the threat of rejection is real. They are also places where you are reduced to your marketability or   where the length of your facial hair can be a   where you are seen, and hence see yourself, in reductive labels  —   never as “just a bloke called Dave”. The post   Necklace tightens around your neck. I had so far managed to avoid this in the audition room, but now I faced the same threat at US airports. It didn’t help that The Road to Guantánamo had left my passport stamped with an Axis of Evil world tour  —   shooting in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran within six months. I spent the flight sweating in defiance of   wondering what would await me. When I landed, the officer assessing me shared my skin colour. I wondered whether this was a good sign or if he was one of the legendarily patriotic Cuban border officers I had heard about, determined to assess how   I was with a thumb up the anus. He looked at my passport, then at me, frowned and drew a big ‘P’ over my immigration card. I immediately thought it stood for Paki. “Protocol!” I was led down a long corridor, without explanation, before turning into a side room that felt instantly familiar. Apart from a Chinese family and a South American pilot battling the indignity with his spotless uniform, the holding pen was filled with 20 slight variations of my own face, all staring at me  —   kind of like a Bollywood remake of Being John Malkovich. It was a reminder: you are a type, whose face says things before your mouth opens you are a signifier before you are a person you are back at stage one. The holding pen also had that familiar audition room fear. Everyone is nervous, but the prospect of solidarity is undercut by competition. In this situation, you’re all fighting to graduate out of a reductive purgatory and into some recognition of your unique personhood. In one way or another you are all saying: “I’m not like the rest of them. ” The   desk officer was no older than 23. By the time I was called up to audition for him, my spiel to explain the passport stamps was ready. I’d show a letter from the film’s producer, I’d say “  film” and I’d flash a shiny new DVD. But the kid questioning me seemed more nervous than I was. He had clearly been to the same “Beware Bloodthirsty Actors” seminar as the intelligence officers at Luton. “Step back from the counter!” I was bounced up the chain for a proper interrogation by a dangerously fat man and his moustache. I sat and waited, rehearsing my lines. When the interrogation came, it was more of a car crash than my Slumdog Millionaire audition. “Oh yeah? Afghanistan? What kinda movie were you making there?” The question shot through me with a shudder. It reminded me of the questions I faced at Luton airport, but also of the question I ask myself all the time. Was I adding to the catalogue of stage one, two, or three? Was it a film my    self wanted? Would it make the necklace looser or tighter? I thought about the right way to answer him. The Road to Guantánamo was a   but maybe saying I was in a documentary about Guantánamo Bay wouldn’t be wise. Drama should do. I said: “Erm, it’s an   drama called The Road to Guantánamo. ” There was a long silence. He raised an eyebrow. I offered up the DVD. It had a photo of me handcuffed in an orange jumpsuit on its cover. I immediately regretted it. Longer silence. Second eyebrow goes up. He leaned in. “Do you know anyone who wants to do harm to the United States?” I shook my head and made Hugh Grant noises, venturing a “gosh!” in there somewhere. He absorbed my performance before holding up a book from my luggage. It was Mohsin Hamid’s novel The Reluctant Fundamentalist. “What’s this book?” I explained, but he wasn’t really listening. He deployed a     intelligence protocol by Googling me, which returned a news clipping about the Luton airport incident. Fuck. My heart sank. This was it. No Hollywood for me. I was never gonna be Brad Pitt. I wasn’t even gonna be Apu from the fucking Simpsons. What was I thinking? When, after an agonising three hours, I was waved through, I couldn’t believe it. I felt relieved, grateful, lucky  —   and then suddenly incensed. On the way out past my lookalikes, I gave a loud, “  aliekum. ” No one leapt to return the greeting. Perhaps they lacked the safety net of a convincing “gosh!” I joined a friend in Manhattan for dinner, apologising for being three hours late, and zoned out while they discussed astrology. Someone at the dinner turned to me. “You’re such a terrorist,” she said. I blinked. What the fuck? My face screwed itself into the expression I wish I’d pulled instead of mewling apologetically at the border officers. “What the fuck is that supposed to mean?” My friend put her arm on mine and squeezed. “Riz, she asked if you’re a Sagittarius. ” I swallowed. Baffled faces pinned me with concern. “Right. Sorry. Yeah. Yes I am,” I said. A similar version of the same thing happened again soon after. And again. And again. And again. I grew belligerent. One officer asked if I had had any military training. My school had a   programme that I was swiftly ejected from, but I just answered “yes” without expanding. I was asked if I had travelled to Iran, Iraq, or Afghanistan recently. “All except Iraq, but if it helps I’ve also been to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” I smiled. Childish perhaps, but the situation itself is infantilising. Feigning obliviousness to an officer’s suspicion and refusing to pander to it was my only defence. But the farce rolled on. Twice when applying for a US work visa I was subjected to a Section 221G  —   a lengthy background check against a global database of terrorists  —   which almost lost me the jobs. I saw the email correspondence between the state department and my attorney: “Hey Bill, looking at your client Mr Ahmed  —   pretty   name, huh? Saw his Post   Blues song, what’s with the ‘I heart Osama’ routine?” Fair enough, you might think. Search him. Look at his racial profile and his passport stamps and his dangerously hilarious rap lyrics. But since I had been let into the US and deemed safe just the previous month, another rigmarole this month was obviously fruitless. In the end, I was always let in, so these airport auditions were technically a success. But they involved the experience of being typecast, and when that happens enough, you internalise the role written for you by others. Now, like an   method actor, I was struggling to break character. I tried not to ingest all the signs telling me I was a suspect. I tried not to buy into the story world of this “protocol” or its   stereotype of who I was. But when you have always moulded your identity to your environment and had your necklace picked out by others, it’s not easy. I couldn’t see myself as “just a bloke”. I failed at every single audition I went up for. Rehearsing a scene beds a role into you. But sometimes if you   it without unearthing any new meaning in it, you can suddenly forget your lines. You realise that you are on a stage, not in the real world. The scene’s emotional power and your immersion in it disappears. And so it dawned on me that these searches were a fictional   taking place in a bubble, rather than an assessment of my worth. This was the way to see it. And it turns out this is also the way to see auditions. The protocol lost its chokehold on me, and I started getting roles again. One big job secured me a proper US visa, and soon I was getting waved through without the protocol. I began inching towards the Promised Land. Now, both at auditions and airports, I find myself on the right side of the same velvet rope by which I was once  . But this isn’t a success story. I see most of my fellow Malkoviches still arched back, spines bent to snapping as they try to limbo under that rope. These days it’s likely that no one resembles me in the waiting room for an acting audition, and the same is true of everyone being waved through with me at US immigration. In both spaces, my exception proves the rule. Don’t get me wrong: although my US airport experience is smoother, I still get stopped before boarding a plane at Heathrow every time I fly to the US. But now I find it hilarious rather than bruising. Easy for me to laugh with my work visa and strategically deployed “gosh!” perhaps. But it’s also easy for me to laugh, because the more I travel, the more ridiculous the procedures become. Heathrow airport draws its staff from the nearby Asian suburbs of Hounslow and Southall. My “random selection” flying to LA was so reliable that as I started travelling more, I went through a   stretch of being searched by the same   Sikh guy. I instinctively started calling him Uncle, as is the custom for Asian elders. He started calling me “beta” or son, as he went through my luggage apologetically. It was   but veered dangerously close to incest every time he had to frisk my crotch. “How are you, son?” “I’m er, ooh, er, good. Uncle. ” As I’ve travelled more, I’ve also done more film work, increasing the chances of being recognised by the young Asian staff at Heathrow. I have had my films quoted back at me by someone rifling through my underpants, and been asked for selfies by someone swabbing me for explosives. The last kid who searched me, a young Muslim boy with an immaculate   and goatee, was particularly apologetic. “Sorry bro. If it makes you feel any better, they search me before I fly too. ” We laughed, not because he was joking, but because he was deadly serious. It was the perfect encapsulation of the minority’s shifting and divided self, forced to internalise the limitations imposed on us just to get by, on the wrong side of the velvet rope even when (maybe especially when) you’re on the right side of it. We cracked jokes and bumped fists. As I left, he called after me with a question. “Bro, what kinda film you doing next?” I looked at the ID badge hanging from a string around his neck. I told him that I hoped it would be one he liked. • This essay is extracted from The Good Immigrant, a book of essays about race and immigration in the UK by 21 British black, Asian and minority ethnic writers, edited by Nikesh Shukla and featuring contributions from Bim Adewunmi, Salena Godden, Musa Okwonga, Coco Khan, Himesh Patel and more.

Marvin Gaye’s family approve What’s Going On documentary
Marvin Gaye seminal 1971 album What’s Going On is to be the subject of a documentary. Centred around themes of poverty, police brutality, drug abuse and injustice in the wake of Martin Luther King Jr’s assassination and with lyrics written from the perspective of a Vietnam war veteran, the film will document the making of a soul classic that “challenged America and the world to   going on to inspire a generation of artists and music lovers” the producers told Variety.  “The relevance of [his] masterpiece   …     is as strong as ever. ” According to the publication, this will be the first time his former wife, Janis Gaye, and his children, Nona, Marvin III and Frankie Gaye have approved a project such as this, with his family contributing previously unseen archive footage of the late artist to the film’s producers.  Including “exclusive interviews with some of Motown’s top stars and    archive footage unearthed by Gaye’s children and former wife,” the documentary will be filmed in Washington DC, LA and Detroit.  “We look forward to participating and sharing what we can through friends, family, photos, footage and priceless stories that only those who knew our father up close and personal would know, as well as his contemporaries, purists and fans who have studied him and his art over decades,” the Gaye family said in a joint statement. “What’s Going On   …     something many of us find ourselves asking today, 45 years later. Peace. ” The film is scheduled for release in 2017. • This article was amended on 15 July 2016 to add a credit to Variety that had been omitted in error

Islamic State retakes historic city of Palmyra
Islamic State fighters appear to have reconquered the historic city of Palmyra after days of intense fighting on its outskirts prompted a withdrawal by the Syrian military. “The catastrophe has happened, I am in absolute shock,” said Maamoun Abdulkarim, Syria’s director of antiquities, in a phone interview. “I am losing hope, it looks like we have lost the city. ” An   news channel claimed victory in the battle on Sunday, saying its soldiers had reclaimed control of the entirety of Palmyra, once a Silk Road oasis that boasted some of the   ruins of antiquity. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring group, confirmed the takeover. It was the second time Isis has seized Palmyra. In May last year, jihadi militants stormed the city after a   siege that ended with the mass retreat of the Syrian military. Militants rampaged through the city’s museums and ruins, blowing up the    towering Temple of Bel and the Arch of Victory, along with other priceless artefacts, and killed Khaled   Palmyra’s   leading archaeologist.  The group also carried out mass executions in the historic amphitheatre. The Syrian army, backed by Russian fighter jets, reclaimed the city in March this year in a   campaign. Moscow organised a musical concert at the amphitheatre shortly afterwards. The loss of the city will come as a shock, particularly with Isis in retreat throughout Syria and Iraq with the killing of its top lieutenants and facing increasing pressure in its two largest cities, Mosul and Raqqa. Abdulkarim said the vast majority of the artefacts that were in Palmyra had already been moved to Damascus for safekeeping, a prescient move that may help preserve something of the city’s heritage, one of the few aspects that unite many Syrians after nearly six years of civil war. But the remaining buildings in the old city, a Unesco world heritage site, including the amphitheatre and the ancient citadel, remain at risk. There were few people left in the city under 1, 000 by government estimates. “We can only pray to God to protect Palmyra and we appeal to the international community to protect Palmyra, because it is a bridge truly between east and west,” said Abdulkarim. “Otherwise we will weep for more destruction of Syria’s heritage. ” The loss of Palmyra a second time raises questions about the ability of the Syrian military, worn down after years of fighting, to hold territory even with the backing of its Russian allies. The battles on the outskirts of Palmyra have been ongoing for four days and Islamic State’s takeover was preceded by a night of intense bombardment by Russian warplanes, which carried out more than 60 airstrikes. It will also come as a shock to observers as Isis is in retreat on multiple fronts. Drone strikes have claimed the lives of most of the group’s leading officials, including its spokesman, Abu Mohammad  . Iraqi troops are inching their way through the eastern half of Mosul, the most populous city under the   caliphate’s control, and Kurdish paramilitaries as well as   rebels have been steadily gaining ground against the militants in northern Syria. The latest conquest also shows Isis still has the ability to rally sufficient troops to its cause to conquer territory. “It’s a repeat of the same scenario,” said Abdulkarim. “Today we will watch that same film again, that horror movie, if they stay in the city. It will be an insult to the entire international community and to civilisation as a whole. I hope the international community unites on this again. It must not be politicised. Palmyra is an international treasure. ”

’Save us’: Aleppo civilians plead for help as airstrikes resume
Desperate residents in eastern Aleppo spent another day under intense bombardment on Wednesday and their elation at a possible rescue deal was replaced with horror as attacks on rebel territory resumed and an evacuation deal appeared to unravel in the face of Iranian opposition. Tens of thousands of civilians trapped without food, water or medicine under a hail of artillery and airstrikes found themselves once again pawns in a geopolitical struggle, with   militia who had spearheaded the ground assault on eastern Aleppo defying a ceasefire agreement brokered by Russia and Turkey to allow residents and opposition fighters under siege to leave the city. Doctors and other civilians, who hours earlier had expressed optimism that they would be able to evacuate eastern Aleppo, again implored the international community to put a stop to the fighting that had left their homes in ruins and allow them to seek a safe haven elsewhere. “We will always remember and never forget how the criminals of the world forced Aleppo’s people to choose between two options, collective death or collective forced displacement, and we chose the lesser of the two crimes,” said one activist in a besieged   district. Rebel officials and a source with knowledge of the negotiations indicated that Iranian intransigence had undermined the deal so far, and Iran’s proxies on the ground, some of whom have been accused of carrying out   shootings of civilians, had violated the ceasefire. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, issued a joint statement on Wednesday night urging an end to the ceasefire violations and “reaffirmed their commitment to start the evacuation of civilians and the opposition through safe corridors as soon as possible”.  A senior rebel official said a ceasefire deal for east Aleppo had been reached on Wednesday night and civilians would began evacuating the besieged eastern districts of the city early on Thursday. Ahmed Qaran Ali, the military spokesman of the Ahrar al Sham rebel group, said the new ceasefire would go into effect on Wednesday night and a first batch of civilians and wounded would leave the following morning. But it was unclear if Iran, which obstructed the first deal reached on Tuesday, was onboard with the new agreement. The original ceasefire was agreed on Tuesday by Turkish intelligence and the Russian military. One of the rebel groups, Noureddine   said Iran had imposed conditions the rebels could not actually comply with. When asked about the specifics of the demands, the group’s spokesman, Yasser   told the Guardian they included a lifting of the siege of Fua and Kefraya, two Shia villages in Idlib province that have been surrounded by rebels for years, as well as deals on prisoners of war, wounded fighters and missing members of   militias. The evacuation of fighters and civilians to Idlib province had been intended to begin on Wednesday morning, but buses intended to transport them  —   decorated with posters of the Syrian president, Bashar    —   returned to their depots empty hours later as the   militias refused to allow the evacuation to proceed. “Iran has prepared to invade our besieged areas and has defied Russia’s agreement,” said  .  Residents said shells had also fallen on the road on which the evacuations were supposed to take place. Assad told Russia Today in an interview aired on Wednesday that western powers were seeking a ceasefire in Aleppo to stop the regime advance and save “the terrorists”. The evacuation of   eastern Aleppo would, however, mean the opposition would cede the city, the last significant urban stronghold where it maintained an active presence. Civilians left in the opposition districts have been posting farewell messages on social media as the   militias and forces loyal to Assad rampaged through newly reclaimed neighbourhoods in what the UN described as a “meltdown of humanity”. Many predicted they would either die once the regime’s forces reached their homes, or would be detained and tortured if they gave themselves up to them. “Save us, people. Save us, people, world, anyone who has even a bit of humanity,” said one doctor in a voice message from a besieged district. “We beg you, we beg you, the dead and wounded are in the streets and people’s homes have collapsed on top of them. Save us. Save us. ” Another resident said: “We want to leave. We don’t want more massacres, let us leave. What is happening?” The UN reported on Tuesday that the   militias, including the Iraqi Harakat   had carried out at least 82 extrajudicial killings, including of women and children who were living in   areas.  Reports of detentions and forced recruitment into the Syrian army have also proliferated in recent days as the regime has advanced through former rebel territory. Residents said the bombardment on Wednesday, with artillery and airstrikes as well as alleged use of cluster bombs, had resumed at a pace greater even than before the ceasefire deal. “This is an urgent distress call,” said another doctor, who on Tuesday night had told the Guardian he was saddened to leave Aleppo but happy that civilians would survive.  “Save the besieged districts of Aleppo. Since the early morning, the shelling has targeted all the besieged neighborhoods with all types of weaponry. The dead are in the street, and so are the wounded, and there are no ambulances. Save Aleppo. An urgent distress call to every free person in the world. ” Another nurse, whose father and brother were killed on the same day earlier in the regime’s offensive, pleaded that civilians be spared. “A lot of shells and bombs are falling on us, no one can walk in the streets,” he said in a voice message. “Hundreds of shells and rockets. Please let us stay alive. Please pressure the regime to keep us safe. Please, from Aleppo, the last call. ” He added: “The medical situation is so bad. No ambulances, no cars, it’s a very horrible situation in our neighbourhoods. Please let our scream arrive to the whole world. ” Weeks of immense suffering and violence in eastern Aleppo since the Syrian regime and its allies began a final push into territory that had been in rebel hands since 2012 have left residents in total despair and increasingly angry at the international community for abandoning them to their fate. The US ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, told the security council late on Tuesday that the Syrian government, along with Russia and Iran, bore responsibility for the deaths of civilians in Aleppo. She accused the three states of putting a noose around civilians in the city, asking: “Are you incapable of shame?   …     Is there no execution of a child that gets under your skin? Is there literally nothing that shames you?” Iranian leaders were congratulating themselves on Wednesday for the role they had played in the assault. The chief military adviser to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Aleppo had been “liberated thanks to a coalition between Iran, Syria, Russia and Lebanon’s Hezbollah”.

The problem with Disney’s new Latina princess: one size doesn’t fit all
As a kid, my   Halloween costumes were Esmerelda, Jasmine or Pocahontas  —   or as I’ve deemed them: the Disney Princess Brown Girl Club. I remember being excited about dressing up as these princesses because my body in these costumes could accurately replicate a Disney Princess. It felt good to be included in the club, to have a seat at the table, even if the brown women at the table were a collection of slapdash caricatures created to sell merchandise. I have mixed feelings about Friday’s premiere of Elena: Princess of Avalor, a new television show on the Disney Channel featuring the rare Latina princess. In an interview, head writer Sylvia Cardenas Olivas has stated feeling an immense amount of pressure trying to “get Elena right” so that she can, in some way, be “everybody’s princess”. So although she has been a long time coming, I fear Disney will flatten and generalize the diversity of Latino identity.  Elena isn’t indigenous or   or from a specific   country. She is a thin,   Latina princess from Avalor, a made up    kingdom that exists in a     world. This, by the way, is baffling: how does one understand their Latino identity without acknowledging colonialism? While the backdrop of Elena is influenced by Mayan culture and Chilean folklore, her race and ethnicity is otherwise based in Disney fantasy.  It’s almost romantic to think that Disney has taken so long to have a   Latina Princess because we are just so hard to get right. Like Elena, I am a mixture of Latino cultures.  When speaking Spanish, my accent is some parts my father’s Colombian paisano, my mother’s Guatemala city, and whatever the hell contrived accent I learned in Spanish class. When people ask me which side of myself I identify with more, I can’t give them a definite answer. I understand my identity to be something that is sloppily mashed together  —   like the food my Abuelita sneaks over from her trips to Guatemala. I know what it is, and I know the way it is supposed to taste, but travel and time has made it kind of just look like a weird thing in a plastic container. But every culture is hard to get right and define, and Disney has certainly mangled them before. I don’t think we can make progress by waiting for “everybody’s princess”. The only way we can get full, accurate representation is by shouting ourselves into existence and carving stories in places that were not meant for us. As a writer, I try to remember that the stories I tell as a Latina woman are not everyone’s. I am not the voice of all Latinas. However, I hope that my words make it seem more possible for others to tell their own stories. Disney is doing the work but not enough of it. And yet. Watching the Elena trailer, I cry when her grandmother calls her mija, meaning “my dear” or “my daughter”. I think of all the dears and daughters watching, their eyes wide, their hearts still believing in magic, soaking every image and sound in. I think of my niece, who last year dressed up as Elsa from Frozen for Halloween, a fake silver braid falling down her back.   I remember that there is so little of us reflected in the media that any resemblance  —   however messy and inaccurate  —   can feel like someone calling us home. It’s a relief to have a costume that fits us, to buy a little doll that looks like us. It can feel good to have a version of ourselves on a backpack, even if it is a caricature.  I am not advocating for blind endorsement of Disney’s merchandising as a solution to Latina media erasure. But I do wonder if my niece will watch Elena  —   a young, loud, ambiguously brown cartoon princess, ruling a kingdom without a man  —   and feel like she, too, can be royal and magical in her body.

’Scottish optimist’ at Monsanto helm battles Bayer takeover bid and protests
Meet Hugh Grant. No, not the famously charming Four Weddings and a Funeral actor, but the far more controversial   “Scottish optimist” who is chairman and chief executive of US agrochemical company Monsanto, AKA “the most evil company in the world”. It’s a big weekend for Grant and Monsanto, a company that has been fighting against adverse publicity since its production of deadly herbicide Agent Orange in the 1960s and, more recently, its role at the forefront of genetically engineered crops. Now it is battling an unsolicited   takeover from the German chemicals company Bayer that would create the dominant force in the world’s food supply. It’s a role reversal for Grant, who had overseen Monsanto  —   which also makes the controversial and probably carcinogenic Roundup weedkiller  —   during a series of takeovers by the agrochemical giant.  Last month, one such attempt hit a roadblock when Monsanto dropped its long pursuit of the Swiss seed and pesticide maker Syngenta, losing to ChemChina. Grant told investors that Monsanto was better off alone. But, analysts say, Grant had left the firm vulnerable to a takeover itself.  Earning forecasts had been cut, and the company was entangled in legal disputes across the world, sending its shares down almost 20% before news of the Bayer approach. “It’s a relentless string of bad news,” Jonas Oxgaard, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, told Bloomberg. “It’s almost like they forgot to sacrifice a goat to the gods. ” The news will get worse this weekend, when hundreds of thousands of activists join a day of coordinated marches against Monsanto in more than 400 cities across the world. In New York, campaigners promoted the march with a billboard in Times Square showing a topless model and the slogan “Keep GMOs out of your genes”.  Grant, 57, is used to controversy. Born in Larkhall, near Glasgow, he has worked at Monsanto since he was 23, first in Scotland and in Asia before moving to the US and becoming president and CEO in 2003.  He regularly faces protests from campaigners outside events, and even stars of the silver screen have been known to give him an earful. Just before Christmas,   actor Mark Ruffalo accosted Grant in green room of CBS studios to tell him: “You are poisoning people. You are killing small farms. You are killing bees. What you are doing is dead wrong. ” Writing about the encounter, Ruffalo said he felt he had to approach Grant because he was “beside myself watching this guy who is responsible for so much misery and sickness throughout the world slime his way through his interview. I could not hold my tongue. ”  Grant’s reply: “What I think we are doing is good. ” When protests are expected, Grant likes to be prepared. On the mornings of the company’s   annual meetings, Grant, who is paid more than $11m (£7. 6m) makes arrangements for protesting shareholders to meet scientists and himself before taking their questions publicly at the meeting.  At this year’s meeting, Zen Honeycutt, founder of Moms Across America, who described him on her website as “the CEO of the Most Evil Company in the World” told Grant: “I’m imploring you to choose a new direction. Stop poisoning our children,” in a reference to claimed links between Roundup and autism and cancer.  Pointing out that he was a father of three, Grant, who holds molecular biology and agricultural degrees from Glasgow and Edinburgh universities, said various studies had shown there was “no linkage” between glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, and any human illnesses. However, the European Union this week delayed a vote on whether to continue to allow Roundup sales beyond June due to concerns that it could be carcinogenic.  Concerns were led by France and Germany, and those countries are likely to lead a fight against the     which some fear could lead to more GMO crops and potentially dangerous pesticides entering Europe.  “Germans view Monsanto as the main example of American corporate evil,” Heike Moldenhauer, a biotechnology expert at German environmental group BUND, told Bloomberg. “It may not be such a good idea to take over Monsanto, as that means incorporating its bad reputation, which would also make Bayer more vulnerable. ” Campaigners are also worried that the proposed takeover, which was made public by Monsanto late into the night on Wednesday just hours after a senior executive had dismissed rumors of an approach as “wild speculation” will leave control of the world’s food supply in too few hands.  If Monsanto is bought (the price has not been made public, but it is said to be about $42bn) the combined   will control 29% of the world’s seed market and 24% of the pesticide market.  “A further concentration of corporate power in the   sector would be bad news for farmers and consumers,” said Franziska Achterberg, Greenpeace’s EU food policy director. “It would accelerate the decrease in crop diversity while limiting consumer choice. Farmers would become even more dependent on just a handful of global players. They would find it harder to choose what they grow and how they grow it. ”  Grant says the problem is that consumers have become too distant from the food they eat, with just 2% of the world’s population involved in agriculture, and the food industry needs to do a better job of educating them about the challenges ahead.  He told the Fortune Brainstorm E conference in California this week that to feed an   population, food production needed to double by 2050 while using roughly the same land area and trying to reduce water use.  After playing defense, his aim now is to convince millennials of the need for more GM crops, which require less natural resources to grow. He’s started by hiring more young people. “We have an enormous community of millennials, and they’re there because they want to be there,” he said. If you’re interested in plant biology, the “party is at Monsanto”.

Buenos Aires zoo to close after 140 years: ’Captivity is degrading’
Buenos Aires has announced plans to close down its    zoo, arguing that keeping wild animals in captivity and on display is degrading.  Mayor Horacio Rodríguez Larreta said that the zoo’s 2, 500 animals will be gradually moved to nature reserves in Argentina which can provide a more suitable environment. The   zoo in the Palermo neighbourhood will become an ecopark when it is reopened later this year.   “This situation of captivity is degrading for the animals, it’s not the way to take care of them,” said Rodríguez, at a ceremony on Thursday. The new ecopark will be “a place where children can learn how to take care of and relate with the different species” the mayor said. “What we have to value is the animals. The way they live here is definitely not the way to do that. ” Some of the zoo’s bird species will be released in the Reserva Ecológica, a riverside ecological reserve covering 864 acres in Buenos Aires. Older animals and those too infirm to be moved will remain at the current site.  The new ecopark will also provide refuge and rehabilitation for animals rescued from illegal trafficking, city officials said. Buenos Aires zoo was one of the city’s main tourist attractions, but despite its popularity, the decaying zoo had been running a loss for its private concessionaires.  It had also attracted bad publicity in recent years, particularly regarding the desperate plight of its captive polar bears during the city’s oppressively hot summers. The zoo’s last remaining polar bear, called Winner, died three and a half years ago partly due to soaring temperatures and inadequate conditions at the zoo. “The most important thing is breaking with the model of captivity and exhibition,” animal rights lawyer Gerardo Biglia, a   campaigner for the closure of this city’s zoo, said in statements to the press. “I think there is a change coming for which we are already prepared because kids nowadays consider it obvious that it’s wrong for animals to be caged. ”Among the 50 animals staying behind will be Sandra, an orangutan that madeinternational headlines two years ago when a Buenos Aires court declared her “a   person” deserving rights.  “The problem is Sandra is a hybrid of Borneo and Sumatra orangutans so she doesn’t socialize,” Biglia said. But Sandra and the other animals that cannot be moved will no longer be exhibited to the public, city officials said.

Chelsea Manning readies for disciplinary hearing over suicide attempt
Chelsea Manning goes before a   disciplinary board of the US army on Thursday charged with interfering with the “good order” of the military prison in which she is held by attempting suicide, an offence that could lead to indefinite solitary confinement. Manning, who is serving 35 years at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas for leaking a vast trove of secret documents on the US war effort in Iraq and Afghanistan, required hospital treatment after she attempted to kill herself in July. The military authorities generated outrage by responding to the army private’s act of despair by charging her with a number of serious disciplinary counts. On Wednesday, the campaigning group Fight for the Future posted a copy of the military charge sheet that had been issued against the soldier. It showed that she has been slapped with two   counts  —   among the most serious available  —   both of which carry a possible sentence of indefinite solitary confinement. One of those counts said that by attempting suicide Manning had caused the “activation of the Force Cell Move Team”  —   the disciplinary crew of prison officers who are deployed forcefully to remove inmates from their cells. Yet in accompanying documents also posted by the group, the official report makes clear that Manning did not do anything to resist the force cell move team and she went with them quietly. The soldier will have to attend Thursday’s disciplinary hearing on her own, without legal representation, in accordance with disciplinary rules. Her lawyer at the ACLU, Chase Strangio, expressed anger at the way the army was handling the fallout from Manning’s suicide attempt. “You cannot possibly have any consideration for someone’s survival or wellbeing if the response to a suicide attempt is to find the most serious infraction to charge them with,” he said. Earlier this month, Manning ended a hunger strike after she was granted gender affirming surgery as a transgender woman. She is expected to meet the medical team in charge of the procedure sometime in the next two weeks. In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is    . In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

JonBenét Ramsey’s family threatens to sue CBS over documentary
The lawyer representing the family of JonBenét Ramsey, the child pageant queen whose death became a sensation in the late 1990s, is threatening to sue CBS over a recent documentary about the case. The body of    Ramsey, a winner of several child beauty pageants, was found the day after Christmas 1996 in her family home in Boulder, Colorado, along with a ransom note.  Despite enormous media attention and mass public speculation  —   many have said the Ramsey case was the birth of the era of the internet sleuth  —   no one was ever prosecuted for her death. CBS’s documentary The Case Of: JonBenét Ramsey, the first episode of which debuted on Sunday, reportedly concludes that Ramsey was killed not by a stranger but by her brother Burke, possibly accidentally. It also claims that Ramsey’s parents covered up the death, according to TMZ. But L Lin Wood, a lawyer representing the Ramsey family, has said the documentary is riddled with “lies, misrepresentations, distortions and omissions” according to Reuters. In a separate statement given to Rolling Stone, Wood said: “In its desire to match or surpass the ratings and profits achieved by other networks in recent true crime series, CBS juxtaposed lies, misrepresentations, distortions and omissions with very few grains of truth to falsely accuse Burke Ramsey of killing his sister. ” “The accusations of the CBS   ‘experts’ lack substantial evidentiary support and contradict the factual conclusions reached by legitimate law enforcement authorities and experts familiar with the actual evidence developed in the case. CBS’ false and unprofessional attacks on this young man are disgusting and revolting,” he continued. In an email, a press representative for the network said: “CBS stands by the broadcast and will do so in court. ” Wood did not immediately respond to a request from the Guardian for comment.

A man for Four Seasons: my goodbye to New York’s modernist cathedral
There are elegant restaurants and erotic restaurants, restaurants for business and restaurants for pleasure  —   and one that was all of these things, more beautiful than any other. But after six decades, the Four Seasons, as stately as ever in its glass box off Park Avenue, will complete its last service on Saturday. Then the restaurant  —   the place Jackie Kennedy called “the cathedral” an acme of modernist design outshining any other space in New York  —   will be despoiled. The tables, the furnishings, and even the pots and pans will be flogged off at auction later this month. The season is summer. But for architectural preservationists, students of modern design, and lovers of New York, this is a winter of discontent. The Four Seasons opened in 1959 at the base of the Seagram Building, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe’s   black skyscraper on Park Avenue  —   a building that the late critic Herbert Muschamp, with slight but understandable hyperbole, once called the greatest work of architecture of the past thousand years. The architect Philip Johnson was tasked with designing the space, which he paneled in rich burled walnut delicate window coverings made of aluminum beads made the light appear to dance. Diners sat in nimble, cantilevered chairs of Mies’s design Eero Saarinen kitted out the women’s powder room with his   tulip chairs and Ada Louise Huxtable, not yet the doyenne of New York architecture critics, had a hand in everything from the champagne flutes to the bread baskets. For the writer Paul Goldberger, Johnson’s design of the Four Seasons substantiated a modernism that was more than mere functionalism  —   and proved “the notion that modernism could, in fact, deal in emotion”. That modernist commitment extended to the art on the walls. Jackson Pollock’s Blue Poles, a syncopated abstraction now in the collection of the National Gallery of Australia, initially hung in the dining room. But the owners wanted a custom job, and called Mark Rothko. The painter got to work on a suite of murals, which darkened as he worked from Bordeaux red to  . The more he worked, the angrier he got, until he finally said: “Anyone who will eat that kind of food for those kind of prices will never look at a painting of mine. ” Rothko pulled out of the commission the murals are now in the collection of Tate Modern in London. In its early days, the Four Seasons staked its claim as a home for American cuisine cooked with the same ambition, and priced at the same altitudes, then still reserved for French restaurants. (Even its name was a statement of intent, decades before the brunching hordes got fixated on “seasonality”.) Upon its opening it was the most expensive restaurant in the city. The New York Times’ critic acclaimed its decor and its verve, though he huffed that the kitchen was not as “exquisite” as “la grande cuisine française”. But the restaurant’s heyday was the 1970s. Outside, the city came within days of bankruptcy, and the streets were choked with crime. Inside, tycoons and socialites conducted a choreographed spectacle of dining and   worthy of France’s ancien régime. New York’s world of publishing gravitated to the Grill Room, as did magazine editors with expense accounts larger than the entire budgets of today’s viral content abattoirs. (“I’ve hatched every one of my deals in the booths over that swordfish and salad,” whirrs Tina Brown.) In 1977 two new managers, Julian Niccolini of Italy and Alex von Bidder of Switzerland, arrived at the restaurant  —   they’re now    —   and under their eyes the Four Seasons became the de facto canteen of New York’s elite, with a regular roster of bankers, fashion types, and at least one war criminal. At the Four Seasons, lunch and dinner were profoundly different experiences. Lunch, unless you were a neophyte or having an affair, always took place in the Grill Room, the restaurant’s anterior chamber. Dinner, unless you were exiled to the Siberian tables, was in the Pool Room, the restaurant’s main dining area. The tables were arranged with ample space, nothing like the   closeness we’ve since grown to accept. A quartet of trees framed the dining space, and in the center was the room’s namesake square impluvium, quietly burbling as diners laughed and gossiped in the golden light. As for the food itself   …     well, shall we say that it did not distract from the decor? Steak and vegetables, some grilled fish, a serviceable   crab: the tide had long gone out in the Four Seasons kitchen, but so what? Here the plates mattered more than what was on them. In 2000 the Seagram Building was sold to the real estate maven Aby Rosen. Despite his prodigious collection of contemporary art  —   acquired in singular circumstances last May he settled with the New York attorney general to the tune of $7m in back taxes  —   Rosen was never impressed with the heritage of the Four Seasons, and he spent years battling with the city’s landmark commission to remove a Picasso tapestry that hung between Grill Room and Pool Room. We should have known, when the Picasso got axed, that the end was coming. With its lease up, Rosen hiked the rent on the Four Seasons more than fivefold. The restaurateurs are moving on, and the new leaseholders will be an outfit called the Major Food Group. They specialize in theme park restaurants at which the young rich can pretend, Marie   to be   immigrants, paying outrageous multiples for matzo ball soup or veal parmesan. Whether the new tenants hit or flop, it won’t be the Four Seasons any more. The restaurant was a Gesamtkunstwerk, and once you’ve sold off the furniture, junked the stately graphic design and driven away the clientele, it will have come apart. So last week I threw on a suit, poured myself into a cab and took myself to the Four Seasons for the last time. The night was hot, and in the Grill Room I had a valedictory martini under the shimmering mobile, designed by the artist Richard Lippold, that was suspended above the bar. In the Pool Room my partner and I ordered a duck, which was carved tableside without much finesse half the carcass was left over, and the meat was as desiccated as bone. The wine was overpriced, the service was doddering. But it didn’t matter: the beaded curtains glistered like Titian’s shower of gold, and all around us was the soft, reliable murmur of contentment. My word, it was beautiful. I stayed until midnight, when all the other diners had picked apart the cotton candy and headed home. No doubt the martinis helped here, but it was my last ever night in the Four Seasons, and so I took off my shoes and socks, rolled up my trousers, and then, after all those years, I jumped into Philip Johnson’s marble pool. I waded around, dragged my hand through the water, and looked at the loveliest room in New York from its very nucleus, from a vantage point I had never seen before. Then I walked out of the Four Seasons for the last time, dripping, and the history of modernism evaporated from my sodden trousers into the New York summer night.

Yale denies expelling basketball captain to prove tough on sexual assault
Yale University has denied it was trying to make an example of a former basketball captain, Jack Montague, when it expelled him over an allegation of sexual assault. The school filed its formal response late on Friday to Montague’s federal lawsuit, which accused the Ivy League university of punishing Montague over what he believes was consensual sex. The lawsuit, filed in June, argues the university expelled the popular athlete in February to prove it was tough on sexual misconduct. It also argues the school coerced the alleged victim into cooperating by inappropriately telling her about a previous misconduct complaint against Montague. The school “admits that some Yale students and some alumni raised concerns about how Yale responded to complaints of sexual misconduct” according to the court filing.  “[It] denies that it had to show that it was willing to take a hard line against male students accused of sexual assault in order to dispel the notion that Yale’s campus was an unfriendly and unsafe. ” The lawsuit argues that the university used the case against Montague, a popular and   athlete, in part as an opportunity to respond to a survey on sexual assault by the Association of American Universities. The association estimated that one in four Yale undergraduates had an experience that “does not meet Yale’s standard for consent”. “In short, imposing harsh discipline on Montague would surely make an impact,” the lawsuit says. A spokeswoman for Montague’s attorney, Max Stern, said they were still reading the Yale response on Saturday and were not ready to comment. Montague, a senior, was expelled after a friend of the woman involved in his case went to a school official who ensures Yale’s compliance with Title IX, the federal law designed to prevent gender discrimination in education. The lawsuit alleges the Title IX officer brought the complaint more than a year after the incident and despite being told the woman did not believe Montague heard her when she tried to end their sexual encounter.  The victim cooperated only after the Title IX officer informed her that Montague had previously received counseling after an incident involving another woman, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges the school did not tell her that case involved him shoving a paper plate down someone’s shirt following a drunken argument outside a pizza parlor. The woman was not “affirmatively misled by the defendants into participating in a formal complaint process initiated by Yale” the school said in its response. The allegation involved the last of four sexual encounters between the two students, his attorneys say. Police and the local prosecutor have said no criminal allegation was ever made against Montague. The lawsuit asks that Montague be reinstated as a student or for Yale to reopen the proceedings against him. It also seeks monetary damages. It is scheduled to go to trial no earlier than February.

Truman Capote’s ashes go up for auction in LA: ’I think he would love it’
Truman Capote is to have a final, macabre whirl of celebrity by having his ashes auctioned off in Los Angeles  —   starting price $2, 000. The remains, contained in a carved Japanese box, will go on the block in September, 32 years after Capote’s death. Whether the author of In Cold Blood would appreciate his ashes being sold off in cold commerce is an open question, but the man flogging them has no doubt. “With some celebrities this wouldn’t be tasteful, but I know 100% he would love it,” Darren Julien, president of Julien’s Auctions, told the Guardian. “He loved to create press opportunities and to read his name in the paper. I think he would love it that he’s still grabbing headlines today. ” The ashes are part of the estate of Joanne Carson, the late wife of former Tonight Show host Johnny Carson, who died last year. Carson was a close friend of Capote and hosted him at her   mansion, where he died of liver disease in 1984, aged 59. The estate’s executors were unsure what to do with the ashes, but after some ethical deliberation they decided to include them in the 24 September auction, Julien said.  “In this case it’s absolutely fine because it really embodies what Truman Capote was and what he loved to do,” Julien said. “Truman told Joanne that he didn’t want his ashes to sit on a shelf. So this is a different way of honouring his request. It is just furthering the adventures of Truman Capote. ” It is unlikely that even the imagination behind Breakfast at Tiffany’s and the   novel could have anticipated ending up as lot 517 —   starting price $2, 000, estimated price $ $6, 000  —   at an auction house at 3327 La Cienega Place, tucked between a Food Express and Five Four Clothing store. Julien said that to his knowledge it was the first time human ashes had been auctioned. “It’s never been done. This will be right up there. ”  The closest comparison the auctioneer could think of was the sale of Napoleon’s penis and a kidney stone belonging to the actor William Shatner, which raised $75, 000 for charity in 2006. Julien said Capote fans and collectors had expressed interest in the ashes and predicted they would fetch “a lot more” than $6, 000. “The one thing about Truman Capote is he’s highly collectible. People collect because they like to show things off. Or they become conversation pieces. This is the ultimate conversation piece. ” Capote, born in Louisiana, began writing fiction aged 11 and started work as a copyboy at the New Yorker. In Cold Blood, his   chronicle of the slaying of the Clutter family in Kansas, published in 1966, was a literary milestone that rocketed him to fame and prestige.  Critics, however, accused the author of wanting the murderers, Perry Smith and Richard Hickock, to hang to enhance the book’s power. Capote never repeated the book’s literary heights book but kept a high profile through society hobnobbing, television appearances and gleeful gossiping. Upon cremation, his remains were kept in the room where he died. Thieves reportedly stole them twice but they were recovered each time. Producers of the Broadway version of Breakfast at Tiffany’s invited the ashes to the 2013 opening gala but Carson, fearing another scare, kept them in  . Julien said with the right buyer Capote may find himself back in his beloved Manhattan. “Hopefully it’s a New York buyer so he can go home. Or someone that travels a lot and can take him with them. ”

The Guardian view on the US election: the time is right for a female president
The final presidential debate, thankfully the last set piece in a wretched campaign, revealed what is admirable and loathsome in American politics. Hillary Clinton displayed a   intelligence and a quick wit. Her facility with facts trumped Donald Trump’s lack of them. Americans finally saw on Wednesday why Secretary Clinton had got rich from giving lectures after leaving office. Her fluency with words, which has earned her $22m in speaking fees, appeared to silence her opponent. Mr Trump, a boastful,   billionaire who trades in racism and misogyny, was left squawking on the sidelines of the debate. His jibes revealed a man out of his depth. His answer was to plunge down deeper. By disgracefully refusing to rule out calling this a rigged election he gave up a fight he had by then lost. Americans should vote for Secretary Clinton as an able and proven politician. A Trump presidency would be bad for America and dangerous for the world, so a vote for Secretary Clinton is the most effective way of preventing it. Mr Trump has been exposed for questionable tax arrangements, outrageous business practices and irregularities at his charity. The billionaire is a grabber and kisser of women who he presumed gave consent because he was famous. There are numerous allegations of sexual assault by Mr Trump. He has demonstrated that he has neither the conscience, training nor sense of history  —   and the desire to be judged well by it  —   to occupy the White House. Secretary Clinton possesses such attributes. She has a serious and sustained commitment on issues like education, healthcare and equality, and she has stood consistently for the rights of women, ethnic minorities, children and the disabled through her long career. However, there are fewer reasons to vote for Secretary Clinton than one would have hoped. For more than two decades she has been part of a political establishment that shaped a dysfunctional country. She has been unable to escape being tarnished by the most damaging policies  —   notably around criminal justice  —   of her husband’s administration. There are   concerns, highlighted by transcripts of her speeches, that she is too close to Wall Street to be an effective check on its excesses if elected. Even so, as the first female president she would represent a symbolic transformative change in American politics. In some ways what Secretary Clinton has had to deal with are ingrained cultural attitudes about what success and leadership look like. These were exposed by the finding that Mr Trump would win if only men voted and Secretary Clinton would win if only women voted. That most men favor Mr Trump over Secretary Clinton demonstrates at some level a more insidious sexism than the one Mr Trump peddles: that centred on the mind, not the body. It is a hostility  —   deeply embedded but rarely conceded  —   against seeing women as genuinely equal. There is little doubt that the 2016 presidential campaign has been one of the most confrontational contests of the modern era. The mood for change has been more pervasive and volatile, and has been supercharged by Mr Trump, a braggart with tyrannical instincts. The backdrop to this election has been genuine and understandable public anger about economic insecurity, growing inequality and frustration with elites. Mr Trump on the right and Bernie Sanders on the left have reflected that mood in their very different ways. That is not going to disappear after 8 November. The election has also raised real questions about the crisis of American democracy. Mr Trump encouraged violence against opponents and threatened to jail Secretary Clinton if he took office. The civility that has marked out US democracy as ordered and restrained appears dead. The next president will have to resurrect it. The political topography of a polarized and resentful nation has been obscured by the preternatural equanimity of Barack Obama. Mr Trump has in some ways skilfully exploited these divisions. On social security he has moved to the left on the campaign trail, telling jobless Americans that he would not touch their benefits. Mr Trump also wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the landmark measure that increases health coverage for   workers and benefits large numbers of immigrants and minorities. This contrasts with the real estate magnate’s offer to expand the US health programme for the elderly  —   Medicare  —   which benefits overwhelmingly older, whiter voters. These dog whistles have been part of American politics for decades. But they come at a time when there is a sense that there are too many losers from economic growth in the country. Driving discontent in the US is a system that no longer defuses high levels of inequality with opportunities for all. The middle classes are poorer today than in 2000. Since the Great Recession the top 1% of families in the US have captured 52% of the income growth. There’s understandable anger that the wealthy were bailed out while ordinary Americans were hollowed out. Voters rage that, in the current incarnation of globalization, jobs that disappeared when the US decided to import rather than manufacture did not come back  —   they simply popped up elsewhere, usually in China. Nowhere has this fury been more keenly felt than in the country’s former manufacturing heartlands, tapping into America’s long history of resistance to free trade and making protectionism a potent political force once again. The politician who has shaped the politics of the country and accounted for populist anger is Senator Sanders. The man from Vermont understood, earlier than most, that voters see the economy as rigged against them by a political system that has been corrupted by big money. His campaign was backed three to one by millennials in the Democratic primaries. This month his favorability ratings in opinion polls are only bettered by Michelle Obama. Senator Sanders’ insurgent campaign has transformed Democratic politics  —   forcing Secretary Clinton to adopt, albeit sotto voce, key planks of his program such as a federal minimum wage of $15 an hour,   public college and opposition to the   Partnership  —   President Obama’s big trade deal. Until this week, Secretary Clinton failed to outline enough of a bold reform program. Tellingly, she offered signs of one in the final televised debate, making unprompted promises to push immigration reforms, a key Sanders point, within the first 100 days of her presidency. Although domestic politics has framed the campaign, Secretary Clinton’s election would be greeted with relief and optimism in most world capitals other than Moscow and Damascus. Despite her hawkish outlook, she will have no alternative but to recognize that the 21st century no longer always looks to the United States as an indispensable hegemon, whether benign or threatening. Secretary Clinton should focus on US soft, not hard, power  —   dealing with climate change and working out fairer global trade arrangements. If Secretary Clinton is elected she must recognize the mood without pandering to its demons. She needs to bring the bold ambition about the role of government to this era that Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt each did in earlier times. She has the intelligence, the seriousness and the experience to do this. The US presidency is hugely powerful: 10% of all posts in federal government are allocated on the basis of political patronage. Secretary Clinton offers the best chance of ensuring those jobs go to competent people. Her choice of Treasury secretary in the aftermath of the banking crisis will be watched with special care, as will an olive branch appointment to Senator Sanders of the kind that president Obama made to her in 2008. She offers the greatest hope that the supreme court defends abortion rights and looks again at issues like campaign finance as well as background checks on gun owners. Yet America will soon find itself weakened at home and abroad if the new president is as badly served by congress as Mr Obama has been for most of his tenure. There is a danger, if Mrs Clinton wins, that the Republicans will relapse into the   that has marked them for a quarter century. The tragedy of this election is that, to become president, Secretary Clinton has had to talk more radically than she actually felt to be an effective president she may be compelled to act more conservatively than she now says she wants to do.

Documentary film-makers face decades in prison for taping oil pipeline protests
Two documentary   are facing decades in prison for recording US oil pipeline protests, with serious felony charges that first amendment advocates say are part of a growing number of attacks on freedom of the press. The controversial prosecutions of Deia Schlosberg and Lindsey Grayzel are moving forward after a judge in North Dakota rejected “riot” charges filed against Democracy Now! host Amy Goodman for her   reporting at the Dakota Access pipeline protests. But authorities in other parts of North Dakota and in Washington state have continued to target other   over their recent reporting on similar demonstrations, raising concerns that the   journalists are not getting the same kind of public support and national attention. Schlosberg, a New     is facing three felony conspiracy charges for filming protesters on 11 October at a TransCanada Keystone Pipeline site in Pembina County in North Dakota, with prosecutors alleging that she was “recruited to record the criminal activity”. The     —   who produced a documentary called How to Let Go of the World and Love All the Things Climate Can’t Change  —   could face 45 years in prison. US whistleblower Edward Snowden recently tweeted his support of Schlosberg, writing: “This reporter is being prosecuted for covering the North Dakota oil protests. For reference, I face a mere 30 years. ” Grayzel, an independent   from Portland, Oregon, was also arrested and jailed on 11 October while filming at a separate pipeline protest in Skagit County, Washington. She and her cinematographer, Carl Davis, had their footage and equipment seized and were kept behind bars for a day. The two were filming activist Ken Ward attempting to shut down the Trans Mountain pipeline, and they now face 30 years in prison for a felony burglary charge, a felony “criminal sabotage” charge and a misdemeanor trespass offense. There were a series of pipeline protests across the US on 11 October. “Everyone needs to be afraid when our first amendment rights are in jeopardy,” Grayzel, 41, told the Guardian on Thursday before her criminal arraignment. “This is not just about me. This is not just about Carl. This is not about Amy Goodman   …     This is about the public’s right to know what is going on in this country. ”   advocates said that both cases are unusual and troubling given that prosecutors have admitted that the defendants were acting as   and are still pursuing aggressive felony cases.  While it’s not uncommon for journalists to face arrest and misdemeanor charges for trespassing or disorderly conduct while reporting at controversial protests, conspiracy, burglary and sabotage offenses are rare for members of the media. “It’s outrageous. It’s an assault on the first amendment,” said Neil Fox, one of Grayzel’s attorneys. “It’s shocking, but it is the kind of climate that we’re living in right now. ” Fox cast blame on the Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, who has made vicious attacks on the media a cornerstone of his campaign. “This is certainly the result of the toxic language that Trump brings to the election. ” Although Ward, a climate activist, had gained access to a fenced enclosure owned by the Trans Mountain Pipeline, the Skagit County sheriff’s report noted that Grayzel and her cinematographer were “just outside the enclosure   …     taking photographs and video”. The report said they confiscated the  ’ phone and “assorted camera equipment” actions that have raised further concerns about press intimidation and free speech violations. Washington prosecutors are relying on laws that were passed in the early 20th century to target labor rights’ protesters, Fox added. “There’s been a revival in the state of Washington of the use of these statutes against labor activists and against environmental activists. ” In Goodman’s case, a judge forced prosecutors to drop a serious “riot” charge, which was centered on Goodman’s viral coverage of the intense Native   protests. But prosecutors and sheriff’s officials said they may continue to pursue other charges against the critically acclaimed journalist. In Schlosberg’s charges, North Dakota prosecutors have alleged that she was part of a conspiracy, claiming she traveled with protesters “with the objective of diverting the flow of oil”. “I was surprised at the conspiracy charges. I never thought that would ever happen,” her attorney Robert Woods told the Guardian. “All she was doing was her job of being a journalist and covering the story. ” Prosecutors in both cases declined to comment.

The Cleveland artists waiting for Donald Trump
Next week, Cleveland will host the Republican national convention for the first time since 1936. At least 50, 000 visitors are expected. In anticipation, the city that’s been fighting for half a century to shake the moniker of “the mistake on the lake” has undertaken a vigorous campaign of beautification. It has hung an estimated 14, 000 strands of “LED twinkle lights” plus 1, 000 banners. It has planted 275 new trees and put down 100 planters, installed 55 directional signs and maps. It has repaired sidewalks, spent $50m redesigning Public Square, and approved the construction of new hotels. Most of this activity is congregated downtown, an area of 3. 2 square miles. Those 50, 000 RNC visitors are expected to spend $200m in Cleveland over the course of five days  —   arguably the reason the largely Democratic city bid on the convention  —   but it’s unlikely they’ll spend much money, or time, outside downtown.  “When I think about a convention, this is   political process happening in a local place,” says artist Kate Sopko. “That local place should speak to that process. ”  Cleveland tends to feels both shrunken and stretched. At its peak, in 1950, it was the   city in the nation today, it has fewer than 400, 000 residents. It has also undergone a demographic shift: whereas   African Americans made up about 30% of the population, today they account for a small majority, 53. 3%. If the inhabitants of Cleveland could talk to the Republican conventioneers about their city, what would they say? This question was the impetus for Sopko’s project The Fixers, a series of six short documentary films released  —   at Spaces gallery, at screenings around Cleveland and online  —   in the   to the RNC. (Full disclosure: I was art writer in residence at Spaces.) Each of the films considers a topic central to the lives of everyday Clevelanders  —   the education system, access to healthy food  —   by focusing on one or two knowledgable locals. These are the titular fixers, a term Sopko learned from a photojournalist that describes locals hired by foreign correspondents to help with finding sources and putting together stories. “We really need to show, through the voices of people on the ground in Cleveland, what’s happening here, how public policy influences our lives for better or worse,” says Sopko. “We need to have people be seen, because they won’t be seen [by the conventioneers]. The Fixers became the incentive to do that. ” Sopko worked with six   and eight fixers. The resulting videos are spare and meditative, mixing ambient music with   shots of the city and interviews with discerning participants. In one, lifelong   rider Marvetta Rutherford stands at the corner of Woodland Avenue and East 79th Street at 9pm amid the glare of a streetlight and falling snow. She laments that if she wants to catch a bus heading north or south at that time, “I’m pretty much out of luck”.  In another, writer and community worker RA Washington and civil rights attorney Jacqueline Greene discuss the broken relationship between Cleveland’s African American community and its police department, which is operating under a consent decree with the Department of Justice after an investigation into its history of excessive force. They consider the implications of the federal government giving Cleveland’s police $50m for the RNC, $20m of which has been spent on new equipment, like riot gear, that will remain long after the convention has gone.  “What this RNC coming to Cleveland represents for the community at large is a silence  —   an invisibility that is generations long,” says Washington in the film. “You’re seeing all these things that they beautify for the convention, and you’re thinking, well, where’s my voice?” For most of the 20th century, thanks to the placement of public housing, redlining, and blockbusting, Cleveland’s African American population was confined almost entirely to a single   neighborhood, Central. When the community did expand, it was into nearby Hough, Glenville and East Cleveland, all of which remained highly segregated. The number of African Americans in the city grew steadily, but so too did the racism they faced: discrimination in employment, segregated schools, the construction of a network of highways that let white people speed past them while fleeing for the suburbs. These frustrations came to the boil in July 1966, when one of the owners of a cafe in Hough denied a black customer a glass of water and placed a sign outside that read “No Water for Niggers”. Violence broke out and lasted a week. Black Clevelanders, however, were in the midst of consolidating their political power. That activism’s biggest triumph came in 1967, when Carl Stokes was elected mayor  —   the first African American mayor of a major US city. Once in office, he embarked on a campaign of urban rehabilitation, including an attempt to reform the police. His progress was halted in July 1968, when a shootout in Glenville between police officers and members of a group called the Black Nationalists of New Libya sparked four days of rebellion. “When the riots did break out in the 60s, the city successfully repressed them and divided the city,” says Jeremy   ethics professor at Case Western Reserve University. “This city’s police force is really suspect  —   Cleveland has a longstanding history of cronyism, of union   and the public prosecutor is in cahoots with them. There’s a long history of the judicial system supporting the police. What you’ve got is a city that’s been divided and then it’s policed. ” Seven people were killed that July in Glenville, including three police officers. The deaths of those officers spurred the formation of the Cleveland Police Patrolmen’s Association. After Tamir Rice was shot and killed by a Cleveland police officer while playing with a toy gun in 2014, the CPPA’s president, Steve Loomis, stated that the    Rice had been “in the wrong”.  The legal system, too, seemed to blame Tamir for his own death. Members of a grand jury declined to bring charges against the officer who killed Tamir, based on the recommendation of the Cuyahoga County prosecutor. Tamir’s family received $6m in the settlement of a wrongful death lawsuit that involved no admission of wrongdoing from the city. The only part of Cleveland that seems to admit to the crime is the spot where it happened: the gazebo at the Cudell Recreation Center. There’s been talk of the city removing it, but for now it stands, transformed by stuffed animals, homemade crosses, and a small   garden into a makeshift memorial. On the day I visited, the stuffed animals seemed to huddle together for protection under the gazebo’s wooden roof, even as the sun lit up the park around them. Children played a few feet away, their carefree presence a sobering reminder of Tamir’s absence. “It’s like that  —   it’s over,” says poet Ali McClain, who works in the Cudell neighborhood running a summer camp and afterschool program for girls, many of whom knew Tamir. She laments the lack of an official memorial, saying, “You would never know. It’s like it didn’t happen. ” McClain is a   along with photographers Donald Black and Gabriel Gonzalez, of the art collective Acerbic, which advocates for artists of color in Cleveland. And for the RNC, Acerbic has decided it wants to remind not just the conventioneers but the whole world about Tamir Rice. The group is “concerned with making sure that his name and his story don’t disappear” says McClain. “If we got 15, 000 media, it’s gonna be the most photographed place in the world,” adds Black. “What do we want to say to the world?” Remember Me Always. You Will Never Be Forgotten. These are some of the phrases appearing on   that Acerbic is printing for its Tamir Rice project. Positioned below Tamir’s first name, the slogans form part of a striking logo that looks like it might represent a real political campaign: stately white font,   box, white stars, blue shirt. Having recently invested in a    printer, the group plans to make and give away 500 such   during the RNC, subsidized by the sales of 100 of them in advance. Their campaign also involves posters and some street art, but Black and McClain won’t say much more about it, for fear of ruining the surprise (and being stopped by authorities). The two are relatively young, but their view is long, informed in equal parts by personal experiences, talking with Cleveland’s older artists of color about theirs, and a deep racial awareness. To them, as to many Clevelanders, Tamir’s death and the mishandling of it represent one more example of the racism entrenched in one of the most segregated metro areas in the country. “This is a majority black city run by   institutions,” laments Black  —   part of why Acerbic is seeking to become an institution of its own, run by and for artists of color. “A few people have said, ‘Donald, you seem so angry,’ and I am, I should be,” adds Black. “My feelings are hurt. I bought into this shit a long time ago. I wouldn’t have even tried to learn the system if you had just told me it’s not designed for me. ” Michelangelo Lovelace has been navigating the Cleveland system for more than 30 years  —   first as a    artist finding his way, now as a    who recently won a Cleveland Arts Prize. Lovelace paints vivid, figurative,    images of the African American life he sees around him: street and party scenes,   church funerals, allegories about the dangers of alcohol. Art has always, he says, served as a kind of therapy  —   when he was a child it was his comfort zone, and as he grew older, “it also became my release”. Over a lifetime in Cleveland, there’s been plenty for him to release: years of doing “the street thing” divorces and bankruptcies, family deaths. Even as he speaks of these things, though, Lovelace’s disposition is unrelentingly cheerful and friendly, and with his art he follows a similar course: he channels adversity into paint.  He tells me a story about a reception for last year’s Arts Prize. When Lovelace approached another winner who’s also a visual artist, the man made a racist remark that was so offensive, Lovelace and his wife left. “For me, that’s fuel for the fire,” he says. “Every time I think about that, I throw another log on the fire. You can’t get angry and burn down the house, cause it’ll just take you down. ” This is also how he confronts the looming presence of Donald Trump, who’ll soon be arriving in Cleveland. Lovelace’s gallery, Maria Neil Art Project, offered him an exhibition for the month of July, during the RNC, and he accepted on the condition that he could “say what I want to say”. The show, titled We the People, features paintings that all use the American flag as a backdrop. Set against it are a wide range of vividly painted scenes, everything from a solemn vision of a multicultural populace to a woman at a stripper pole to a gruesome view of police brutality, in which a cop stands over a black man lying in a pool of blood.  The latter echoes Lovelace’s Rodney King series, which he made after visiting Los Angeles in 1992. The King series borrows from the aesthetics of graffiti and street art, featuring   marks, newspaper clippings, and phrases like “No Justice, No Peace” atop painted bricks the paintings pulse with anger and urgency. The We the People image, on the other hand, offers a scene painted in calm, confident strokes it’s also an allegory of sorts, as a small black angel stands over the dead man with a sign that reads “Justice or ” while in the background, three cops in a row cover, in turn, their eyes, mouth and ears.  Nearly 25 years have passed in between the making of the two paintings. Lovelace’s artistic approach has changed, but the subject matter has not. Alton Sterling. Philando Castile. Rodney King. Tamir Rice.  “Just because I pledge allegiance doesn’t mean I give up my blackness,” says Lovelace. “Sometimes they look at you like you a strange species, but I’m not, I’m American. Why be quiet? Why say nothing? Turn down for what?” And then, speaking about the coming national election but also, maybe inadvertently, about an earlier era in Cleveland’s history, he continues: “We the people have to make sure the politicians are doing what we put them there for. If we’re gonna change anything, it’s gonna be from the people. ”

Climate deniers, conspiracists and one-percenters: Trump’s cabinet of characters
Barack Obama’s original cabinet was chockablock with historic firsts. The first African American attorney general. The first Nobel laureate upon appointment. The first female homeland security secretary, and the first African American to head the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Donald Trump’s cabinet, if confirmed, also would advance multiple historic firsts. It would be the first cabinet of multiple billionaires. It would be the first cabinet to give pride of place to climate deniers. It would be the first cabinet whose members want to eliminate their own agencies. And it would raise the bar  —   a lot  —   for conspiracy theorists. Before Trump’s team faces closer scrutiny from Congress in January, here’s your guide to understanding how these four categories define many of Trump’s major nominees and advisers.  These nominees would lead the four most important agencies in combatting climate change. Scott Pruitt, EPAOklahoma state attorney general, Pruitt wrote in a May 2016 editorial in the National Review that there was a climate change “debate” that was “far from settled. Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind. That debate should be encouraged   …    ” He was part of a “secretive alliance” with fossil fuel companies to fight Obama administration environmental regulations, according to 2014 New York Times reporting. Ryan Zinke, Department of the InteriorCongressman from Montana,  In a 2014 interview, Zinke blamed the buildup of greenhouse gases on volcanoes. “I’m a conservationist, but when there’s a volcano in the Philippines that erupts and produces more CO2 than humans have produced in 200 years  —   is CO2 really the problem?” Rick Perry, Department of Energy,  Former Texas governor, Perry wrote in a 2010 book that “we have been experiencing a cooling trend”. “I don’t believe that we have the settled science,” he said in a 2014 interview, continuing: “Calling CO2 a pollutant is doing a disservice the country, and I believe a disservice to the world . .. I’m not a scientist. ” Mike Pompeo, CIACongressman from Kansas, Pompeo has used congressional hearings to grandstand against “what you all call climate change today”. He told CSPAN in 2013: “There are scientists who think lots of different things about climate change. There’s some who think we’re warming, there’s some who think we’re cooling, there’s some who think that the last 16 years have shown a pretty stable climate environment. ” Rex Tillerson, secretary of stateCEO of ExxonMobil, Tillerson pays lip service to “risks of climate change” but runs the world’s biggest   oil and gas extraction company. Likewise, he has said ExxonMobil favors a climate tax and supports the Paris climate accords but has not backed those statements with action. Trump’s billionaire cabinet could be the wealthiest administration ever. At least six appointees have net worths estimated in the nine figures. Collectively, they have more money than a third of American households combined, according to a Quartz calculation. Wilbur Ross, Department of Commerce, Industrialist, Net worth: $2. 5bn, according to Forbes. He made it the   way: by buying, merging and selling large industrial concerns in steel, textiles and coal. He owns 40 Magrittes. Linda McMahon, Small Business AdministrationEntertainment executive, Forbes pegs the net worth of her husband, Vince McMahon, at $1. 14bn the couple has been married 50 years. Together they created the entertainment juggernaut now known as World Wrestling Entertainment. Betsy DeVos, Department of EducationPhilanthropist,    of Richard DeVos, who   the    giant Amway, which specializes in beauty, home care and health products such as the dietary supplement Nutrilite.  Forbes pegs Richard DeVos’s family’s net worth at $5. 1bn. Steve Mnuchin, treasury secretaryFinancier, Net worth: about $655m, according to Bloomberg. Former Goldman Sachs partner, hedge funder and Hollywood producer (Sully, American Sniper, The Legend of Tarzan).  Rex Tillerson, Net worth: around $365m, according to Bloomberg. Outgoing chairman of ExxonMobil after 41 years with the energy giant. Elaine Chao, Department of Transportation Public servant, Her net worth has faced scrutiny because her husband is Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who is subject to financial disclosure rules. Chao is a daughter of James SC Chao, a shipping magnate whose net worth PolitiFact had difficulty nailing down in 2014, except to note that the family foundation recently gave $40m to Harvard.  A noticeable Trump innovation in picking a cabinet: appointing leaders who have said they would like to destroy the agencies they’re supposed to lead. A variation is appointing leaders whose careers have undercut the agencies they’re supposed to lead.  Scott Pruitt, Pruitt has been involved in multiple lawsuits against the EPA. He is currently part of a legal action waged by 28 states against the EPA to halt the Clean Power Plan, an effort by Obama’s administration to curb greenhouse gas emissions from   power plants. Pruitt has said the American people “are tired of seeing billions of dollars drained from our economy due to unnecessary EPA regulations” and he boasted on his LinkedIn page that he was “a leading advocate against the EPA’s activist agenda”. Rick Perry, Perry famously suffered a memory lapse during a presidential debate in trying to name the Department of Energy as one of three federal agencies he would eliminate if elected. “Oops,” he said. Perry’s background in nuclear issues, which is the energy department’s main charge, appears to be limited to an effort to privatize the disposal of radioactive waste in Texas. Perry’s two immediate predecessors in the job were both nuclear physicists. Andrew Puzder, Department of LaborFast food executive, Puzder is a vehement critic of government regulation and staunch opponent of minimum wage laws and the Fight for $15 movement. He blames Obamacare for increased labor costs and has diagnosed a “  restaurant recession”.  Rex Tillerson  As ExxonMobil’s main dealmaker around the world, Tillerson had interests that sometimes ran up against US interests. He continued (legally) to do business with Russia after the country became the target of continuing sanctions. During the Obama years, Tillerson defied the state department to cut an oil deal with the Iraqi Kurds, the New Yorker pointed out. Betsy DeVos  DeVos has been an advocate for school vouchers, which critics say undercut public schools.  Trump traffics in conspiracy theories and fake news  —   Barack Obama was born outside the US and sympathizes with terrorists, the election was rigged, Hillary Clinton is a criminal  —   so it’s only proper that his cabinet should too. Here are the three Trump nominees in competition for the tinfoil hat trophy. Ben Carson, Department of Housing and Urban Development Retired neurosurgeon, Carson believes pyramids were built by the biblical Joseph to store grain, that Vladimir Putin, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and Mahmoud Abbas attended school together in Moscow in 1968, that Jews with firearms might have been able to stop the Holocaust, that he personally could stop a mass shooting and that Osama bin Laden enjoyed Saudi protection after  . Stephen Bannon, chief strategist Former CEO of Breitbart and Sirius XM radio host, Breitbart ran stories linking Hillary Clinton’s aide Huma Abedin to the Muslim Brotherhood in addition to stories stoking antisemitism, white supremacy and misogyny. As a Sirius host, Bannon made the “case that House speaker Paul Ryan is a liberal globalist trying to sell out the American worker to foreign Islamist shills” the Daily Beast reported.  Michael Flynn, national security adviserRetired general, Flynn tweeted that Hillary Clinton had ties to “money laundering, sex crimes with children, etc”. He told his Twitter followers to buy the book of a   troll who said Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta was part of a sex cult and the Orlando nightclub shooter did not act alone.  He once said there were signs in Arabic along the Mexican border, which he had seen pictures of, to guide “radicalized Muslims” into the United States. “On three occasions, Flynn tagged in his tweets Jared Wyland, an ‘ ’ antisemitic commentator who has tweeted about the ‘Liberal Jewish media’,” CNN reported.

Dear Britain: Elena Ferrante, Slavoj Žižek and other European writers on Brexit
Dear Britain, I don’t have much sympathy for the current European Union. Its upper floors are elegantly furnished, with spacious halls for parties and banquets there are abundant stores and provisions, rooms with panoramic views where building bylaws pertaining to those residing on the lower floors are discussed and drawn up, security services that design alarm systems and sturdy doors to keep out those who want to set up camp in the entrance hall or at least in the basement. It’s an ugly Europe, this one. Behind its facade, it safeguards the interests of those countries that are strongest, both economically and militarily. And yet, despite the rules and regulations, it has never stopped thinking that  —   when there is nothing further to be gained  —   it is best to throw off the union and make do with the old cocksure ways of the proud old nations. This belief is the most wrongheaded of all. The single pieces of Europe have long lost their autonomy and centrality. Major financial crises cannot be faced by stewing in one’s own juice. Migrations cannot be controlled with traffic lights or barbed wire. Global terrorism is not a video game you play at home in your living room. The world’s climate cannot be fixed by opening an umbrella. The happy few are no longer enough, not even for themselves, but must confront the unhappy many. And so, while it may be a union that has united little or nothing, it is necessary, in my opinion, to stay together at all costs. What we need now is not many small countries but a continent. Amid conflicts and confrontations, in defiance of the facts, we must try to move towards a community that instead of drawing up lists of objectives becomes actively political and puts an end to countless intolerable inequalities. Contained in the treasure chests of its sovereign states, Europe has many kinds of poison but also wonderful jewels. It is time to throw away the former and pull out the latter in preparation for our impassioned feast of common thought and action. We don’t need roots now: they make plants of us, splendid, yes, but bound to the ground, and nowadays everything is more mobile than ever, shifting quickly from one shape to the next. A broad, true identity must open itself up to all identities and absorb the best in them. Time is short. Many kinds of malaise and poverty are spreading, the streets are increasingly stained with blood, the worst intentions feed the worst kinds of politics. Staying together is no longer an option but an obligation and an urgent necessity. Women and men of Britain, please, let us stay together, and change Europe together. • Translated by Daniela Petracco. Frantumaglia: An Author’s Journey Told Through Letters, Interviews, and Occasional Writings will be published in November by Europa Editions. Dear Britain, As Spaniards born under the Franco dictatorship (especially those of us who belonged to families on the losing side of the civil war) we were always aware that we might one day have to leave our country and go into exile. Whenever I imagined this possibility, my chosen destination was never France or Italy or some Latin American country, but Britain. This was perhaps because, early on, I acquired a reasonably good knowledge of English, but it was doubtless also because I had read so much British literature and seen so many British films that Britain seemed to me a familiar place and as undeniably European as my home town of Madrid. Indeed, I partly owe my vocation as a writer to Richmal Crompton and her Just William (or Guillermo as we knew him) books. I was brought up reading Charles Dickens and Robert Louis Stevenson, Rudyard Kipling and GK Chesterton, J Meade Faulkner and Anthony Hope, Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle. My childhood heroes were portrayed by actors such as John Mills, Stewart Granger, Jack Hawkins, David Niven and Trevor Howard. My first platonic love was Hayley Mills. Britain was not only a constant presence in my fantasies, it also seemed to me a country that would be sure to take me in if things took a turn for the worse in Spain a place where I would not feel entirely foreign. For me, it is as much a part of Europe as Italy, Germany, France or Austria, possibly even more so. I knew, too, that it was an invariably democratic country, respectful of individual freedoms and generous to those who took refuge there: from Joseph Baretti to Nikolaus Pevsner and from Elias Canetti to my friend Guillermo Cabrera Infante, who was exiled from Cuba in 1965, not to mention such Spanish writers as Blanco White, Luis Cernuda, Arturo Barea and Manuel Chaves Nogales. It seemed only natural that Britain should form part of the EU. True, the EU does not tend to arouse great passion  —   it more often provokes feelings of discontent  —   however, it is largely responsible for the fact that, since 1945, the various countries of this continent have not resorted to killing each other. That this fails to spark enthusiasm and, above all, gratitude, only demonstrates how ignorant and forgetful our   societies are. Were Britain to leave the union, it’s unlikely that anyone would immediately start a war, but you never know. One thing I do know is that the rest of the continent would feel orphaned, amputated, empty and even defenceless. Let me explain that last word: those of us who do still remember ought to give thanks every day for the existence of that island separated from us only by a narrow strip of sea. Without it, it is probable that the entire continent would have suffered the consequences of a crushing victory by Hitler. Simply knowing that this small island spent years resisting tyranny and invasion is enough to make us all want to be able to count on its continuing presence, and always to be on the same side, whether in wartime or during long years of peace. We want to keep it as close to us as possible, even if only for purely selfish reasons and in order to save us from ourselves. • Translated by Margaret Jull Costa. Thus Bad Begins is published by Penguin. Dear Britain, Let’s keep it short: what is the EU? It’s the consequence of the second world war. It’s the attempt to make things better. Even if you don’t always get the best result for yourself. Many, throughout the whole of Europe, don’t share this ambition any more. That’s understandable, for 60 million people had to die before most found it a worthwhile ambition. And that was a long time ago. Everyone has the right to wait until this view comes naturally to them. But they should know this: next time they won’t get it so cheaply. • Look Who’s Back is available in paperback from MacLehose. Dear Britain, I have two of your children  —   at least, they might choose to be yours. Their father is British, born and reared. He likes cricket. His name is Murphy. His family moved from Ireland to London after the potato famine of the 1840s and five generations later, they are still called “Spud”. In 1980 he swapped the friendly racism of Surrey for the friendly racism that English people are subjected to in Dublin, which he finds a bit tiresome. The huge migration that unsettled his family and left them forever subject to cheerful insult involved more than a million refugees who left Ireland for the urban centres of Britain and America. When a population tips like that it is hard to rebalance. Ireland has been weakened by migration ever since, and Britain has been strengthened by it. I don’t think there will be a Brexit because people rarely vote against their clear economic interests (“Apart from working class Tories,” mutters Mr Murphy). But I would like Britain to stay in Europe for more positive reasons. I could talk about idealism. I could talk about the second world war, or other wars less glorious  —   ask why you don’t vote to leave Nato, for example, or the community of nations that went to Iraq  —   but the arguments for Brexit seem based on a fear of being contaminated by foreigners, and fear is never truly idealistic. It is tribal. It is the kind of atavistic thinking that makes me step back from my own nationalism, now and then. So it is easy for me to set aside my Irishness in order to say: I like Britain very much. I mean, I like whatever Britain is  —   a shifting thing, a landscape, a language, a library full of astonishing books, a mosaic of peoples stalled in one migration or another, from the raw Saxon faces you see in East Anglia, to the sari shops of Bradford, to the eyes of my two children, who came from God knows where. They like the trees, by the way. Also, and in this order: curry, cousins, yorkshire pudding, “the way that everything is better funded” the BBC, Bristol, sarcasm, the pub, AFC Wimbledon, Edgar Wright, Topshop and “how the politicians seem very polite but are really furious”. So now you know. Of course as an Irishwoman I also have to be cheerfully insulting and say that I am really sorry that Britain lost her empire with all the money and the power that came with it, I know that must be hard for you all. But as you would say to any grand old lady, in her nostalgia and wounded pride, “Don’t isolate yourself. ” It must be so tempting to shut the doors and pull the curtains, keep the money under the mattress until the value fades out of the old notes, and think about the past. Which was great, if a little bit unfair. But the world has changed, since Britain was last alone. Don’t go. You will not thrive, and we want you to thrive. You are still family to us all. • The Green Road is published by Vintage. Dear Britain, Last year I tried, and failed, to convince the EU top brass to behave humanely toward my   country. Now, I am writing to you with an odd plea: that you stay in this same EU  —   yes, the one that crushed our Athens spring and has been behaving abominably ever since. Some will deploy tabloid logic to explain my plea (“Varoufakis wants the UK to stay in to pay for Greece’s bailouts”). Others will accuse me of abandoning the fight for restoring democracy. Yet I trust that your Pythonesque appreciation of paradox will pierce through the seeming contradiction. The reason I want you to stay in is that voting to leave will not get you “out”. Rather than escaping the EU, Brexit will keep you tied to a Europe that is nastier, sadder and increasingly dangerous to itself, to you, indeed to the rest of the planet. The masters of the City will never allow a new Boris Johnson government to even think of leaving the EU’s single market, despite Michael Gove’s musings. Which means that all the gadgets sold in your shops will have to abide by standards made in Brussels, your environmental protection rules will be drawn up in Brussels, and market regulation will be (yes you guessed it) determined in Brussels. So, even after Brexit, the majority of your laws will be written in the same dreary Brussels corridors as now, except you will have no say in their shaping. With your democracy as truncated as it is now, you will remain stuck, albeit less powerful, in a Europe whose fragmentation Brexit will accelerate. The EU is undoubtedly bureaucratic, opaque and contemptuous of the parliamentarianism that you and I cherish. You may, therefore, conclude that speeding up the EU’s fragmentation is not such a bad idea. Think again! Will its disintegration cause progressive democrats to rise up across Europe, empower their parliaments, usher in the forces of light and hope, and foster harmonious cooperation on the continent? Not likely. The EU’s fragmentation will divide the continent in at least two parts, the major fault line running down the Rhine and across the Alps. In the north east, deflation will rule, with millions of working poor Germans, Poles and so on becoming unemployed. In the Latin part, the order of the day will be inflation with unemployment. Only political monsters will crawl out of this fault line, spreading xenophobic misanthropy everywhere and ensuring, through competitive devaluations, that you will also be drawn into the ensuing vortex. This is why I am pleading with you to stay in our terrible EU. Europe’s democrats need you. And you need us. Together we have a chance of reviving democratic sovereignty across Europe. It won’t be easy. But it is worth a try. When I was student, a close friend who hated parties nevertheless never missed one just so that he would have something to bitch about the day after. Please do not be like him. Please stay in the EU with enthusiasm for our common cause: to take arms against a sea of troubles, and, by opposing, end them. • And the Weak Suffer What They Must? is published by Vintage. • The graphic novel The Arab of the Future, Vol 1 by Riad Sattouf is published by Two Roads. Dear Britain, You have many talents. Playing football springs to mind. Brewing decent beer. Speaking a language that people understand. On the other hand, you seem to be having trouble driving. It is the wrong side, you know. But it seems to work, as long as you all make the same mistake. And you were more than brave during the war. Churchill said all he had to offer was blood, toil, tears and sweat. But he left out  . You taught the world and yourselves that a Brit is a Brit is a Brit. Meanwhile, Swedes let the Nazis pass through our country, cap in hand. War is bad. And still Europe engaged in war for a long time in the first half of the 20th century. More than 50 million Europeans died. And we came to sensible conclusions: we decided to work together, across the borders, in such a way that attacking your neighbour would be like attacking yourself. We called it the European Coal and Steel Community, a rather ingenious construction presented by a French politician of German descent. As more countries joined, this community eventually turned into the European Union, and it was quite something. Fifty million died during the first half of the last century. Fifty thousand in the second half. Were it not for the downfall of Yugoslavia, there would be no official number at all. But then there is this thing called memory. We tend to forget a lot. Like England not being able to beat Sweden in football for 24 straight years (you were just as surprised every time we won). Or like the EU, and what it is really for. In Sweden, people tend to write about how the UK would be worse off leaving the union. The fact that it would be a disaster for the rest of us is given less attention. I think Brexit would be the beginning of the end of an unprecedented period of peace at the heart of Europe. Without you, the EU will crack at its very seams. I wish you would stay, and that all of us together  —   in toil, tears and sweat but not blood  —   will steer the peace project that is the European Union in the right direction. If you accept, you may drive on whichever side of the road you prefer. We will even let you win Euro 2016 this summer. After all, the manager of the England team is practically half Swedish. • Hitman Anders and the Meaning of It All by Jonas Jonasson is published by 4th Estate. Dear Britain, The country I come from is where Europe technically ends today, or begins, depending on your journey. But only technically: recently, in European Turkey, I met people who feel proudly European, just minus the passports. To them, Europeanness, like the secular republic, is a   value, worlds away from Brussels, where beautiful Europa has been nibbled to a drab word. The Turks on the west side of the Bosphorus are perhaps the last European idealists. It was the Ottomans who gave Europe  —   via the Balkans  —   the word komshulak, neighbourliness, the spirit of living next door convivially, sharing joys and sorrows as the tides of history turn. Komshulak is the highest, if humblest, form of civility. When it breaks down, everything breaks down. Komshulak is at the heart of the battered European project. Battered but not beaten. Let us not be fooled, on these most westerly isles, that there is some better place, once we drift away. There isn’t. There is only the cold Atlantic Ocean. I settled in Edinburgh a decade ago, after a decade in New Zealand: I had returned to Europe, and one of its great cities too. When I moved to the Highlands, I lost none of this essential Scottish Europeanness, with its unfussy love of eccentricity, diversity, and     attitude, this sense of continuity with the continent even in remote glens. And though I love Scotland with an almost unseemly passion, I feel like an adopted Brit. Is that a paradox? Then so is the fact that I feel Balkan and European, in the sense that the Balkans are (whisper it) only partly “European”. And here’s the wonderful rub: Europe is not a monoculture. It is a place where people ride reindeer, grow vines, eat Turkish delight, and call themselves Shetlanders. I’ll keep my subscription to that. • Border will be published by Granta in 2017. Dear Britain, When Stalin was asked in the late 1920s which is worse, the right or the left, he snapped back: “They are both worse!” And this is my first reaction to the question of whether or not to leave the EU. I am not interested in sending love letters to the British public with the sentimental message: “Please stay in Europe!” What interests me is ultimately only one question. Europe is now caught in a vicious cycle, oscillating between the false opposites of surrender to global capitalism and surrender to   populism  —   which politics has a chance of enabling us to step out of this mad dance? The symbols of global capitalism are secretly negotiated trade agreements such as the Trade in Services Agreement (Tisa) or Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). The social impact of TTIP is clear enough: it stands for nothing less than a brutal assault on democracy. Nowhere is this clearer than in the case of   Dispute Settlements (ISDS) which allow companies to sue governments if their policies cause a loss of profits. Simply put, this means that unelected transnational corporations can dictate the policies of democratically elected governments. So how would Brexit fare in this context? From a leftwing standpoint, there are some good reasons to support Brexit: a strong nation state exempted from the control of Brussels technocrats can protect the welfare state and counteract austerity politics. However, I am worried about the ideological and political background of this option. From Greece to France, a new trend is arising in what remains of the “radical left”: the rediscovery of nationalism. All of a sudden, universalism is out, dismissed as a lifeless political and cultural counterpart of “rootless” global capital. The reason for this is obvious: the rise of rightwing nationalist populism in western Europe, which is now the strongest political force advocating the protection of working class interests, and simultaneously the strongest political force able to give rise to proper political passions. So the reasoning goes: why should the left leave this field of nationalist passions to the radical right, why should it not “reclaim la patrie from the Front National”? In this leftwing populism, the logic of Us against Them remains, however here “they” are not poor refugees or immigrants, but financial capital and technocratic state bureaucracy. This populism moves beyond the old working class anticapitalism it tries to bring together a multiplicity of struggles from ecology to feminism, from the right to employment to free education and healthcare. The recurrent story of the contemporary left is that of a leader or party elected with universal enthusiasm, promising a “new world” (Mandela, Lula)  —   but sooner or later, usually after a couple of years, they stumble upon the key dilemma: does one dare to touch the capitalist mechanisms, or does one decide to “play the game”? If one disturbs the mechanisms, one is very swiftly punished by market perturbations, economic chaos and the rest. So how can we push things further after the first enthusiastic stage is over? I remain convinced that our only hope is to act    —   only in this way do we have a chance to constrain global capitalism. The   is not the right instrument to confront the refugee crisis, global warming, and other truly pressing issues. So instead of opposing Eurocrats on behalf of national interests, let’s try to form an   left. And it is because of this margin of hope that I am tempted to say: vote against Brexit, but do it as a devout Christian who supports a sinner while secretly cursing him. Don’t compete with the rightwing populists, don’t allow them to define the terms of the struggle. Socialist nationalism is not the right way to fight the threat of national socialism.  • Against the Double Blackmail is published by Allen Lane. Dear Britain, Imagine for one moment a peculiar kind of parlour game. Take the famous picture by   Isabey, The Congress of Vienna, from 1815. Look at the gentlemen involved, Alexander I, tsar of Russia, the Duke of Wellington, the devious and eternal Talleyrand, accompanied by a poet and a writer, De Lamartine and Chateaubriand. Then of course Metternich, the Bavarians, the Saxons and the Prussians, Karl August Fürst von Hardenberg, Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt. There is even a Dutchman with a German name, Hans Christoph Ernst von Gagern. Now take out Viscount Castlereagh, the Duke of Wellington, the Earl of Aberdeen and the rest of the British delegation. Remember it is only a game. Make them leave their seats, that means five empty chairs. Look at the intense amazement on the faces of Metternich and Talleyrand. Where are the British? Have they really left the table? These last few months we have been reading and hearing daily about Brexit. Economists, politicians, commentators have inundated us with arguments for and against. We have lost our innocence. There is no escape. We must have an opinion. Even me. I am not an economist. I am a poet, like Lamartine. And I have written a book on Germany. Does that make me an expert? I was a child during the second world war. My father died in the British aerial bombardment of the Hague in February 1945. But the British did not start the war. Germany did. And the Germans have understood better than most they were on the wrong side of history. Therefore they are now convinced that they do not want a German Europe but a European Germany. But what if a British absence will force them to fill the European vacuum? Simply, by their specific weight in the middle, by their industrial strength, and by their history, which will determine the history of Europe, because they are there? And how does that affect the other countries of Europe? I am a European, convinced, against all odds, and amid the sad turbulence of separatists and populists. The Europeans outside Britain cannot decide their fate this time. Now I read that the bosses of hedge funds are supporting the campaign to leave the EU. These are the people who were called not so long ago the dandies of the apocalypse in a French publication   …     but who reads the French newspapers in the UK? David Cameron has spoken about the possibility of a world war. That seems   rhetoric, and has been ridiculed. And yet, who dares to bet that if Britain opts out, later historians might not see this as a Versailles moment? Castlereagh and Wellington never left the congress in Vienna, and as far as I am concerned Cameron  —   or Johnson, or Corbyn  —   should stay seated at the tables of Europe. Our problems are manifold, but 50 years of peace is too precious to gamble with. • Letters to Poseidon is published by MacLehose.

El Salvador police arrest 77 in high-profile raids against powerful MS13 gang
A   dollar network of businesses created by leaders of El Salvador’s most powerful street gang has been exposed by authorities as part of a investigation targeting the groups’ finances. Police and prosecutors announced a series of   raids on Thursday against alleged leaders and business associates of the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) gang, claiming to have delivered a severe blow to the group’s financial operations.  Five   leaders  —   including the gang’s alleged “CEO” who posed as an evangelical preacher  —   were among 77 people arrested across the country after a   investigation known as Operation Checkmate.  Police seized weapons, cash and vehicles during raids at motels, brothels, bars, car dealerships and bus and taxi firms  —   businesses they claim were created using illicit funds, mainly from extortion rackets.  The arrests came amid growing international concern about the government’s mano dura  —   or iron fist  —   security policy which has outlawed dialogue with the warring street gangs and seen them designated as terrorist groups.  In May police arrested 16 people who had helped negotiate a controversial 2012 truce between MS13 and its biggest rival, Calle 18. After the truce, homicides dropped by 50% but collapsed after a year amid patchy support from the international community.  This week’s operation marks the first serious attempt by Salvadoran authorities to target the gang’s   gains  —   a strategy widely used in the US against national and international crime groups.  Authorities were at pains yesterday to distinguish between the riches enjoyed by the  ’s national leaders and the poverty endured by the vast majority of the gang’s 40, 000 members. Howard Cotto, director of the national police, said at the press conference: “The majority of gang members live in deplorable, very depressed places. The ringleaders have been very careful to keep secret the way in which they live   …     some have even have decided to pay extortion rather than allow members know that these businesses belong to them. ” Cotto pointed to Marvin Quintanilla, 35, who ran a network of evangelical pastors after his release from prison last year. Cotto said the investigation found evidence that Quintanilla’s church role was simply a front to hide criminal activities. But amid widespread praise for the investigation, including congratulatory messages on Twitter by the US ambassador in San Salvador, there was concern that the roundup also targeted activists seeking to stop gang violence. Dany Romero, a former   member who has dedicated himself to human rights and gang prevention work since he was released from prison in 2006, was arrested and accused of using his NGO OPERA as a front for criminal activities.  Romero, who has won several prizes for his activism, has in recent years documented human rights abuses carried out by state security services against alleged gang members in deprived communities. Documents containing information on more than 150 cases, including extrajudicial killings, were taken by police during his arrest. The documents were copied and shared by Romero with international organisations in recent weeks after his name was added to the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanction list.  Romero, and human rights organisations who work closely with him, have consistently rejected the allegations against him.  Rafa Gude, an academic researcher on Salvadoran gang violence, said: “Dany served his time in prison, but since his release has been recognized for the great work he’s done in favour of human rights in prisons and relatives of prisoners. I, along with many others, don’t have any reason to doubt his innocence. We need more   members to do the work that Dany does, and this arrest sends a clear message to those who would follow his footsteps people doing violence intervention are increasingly criminalized for the work they do. ”  Wilson Alvarado, a psychologist and founder of the NGO Nahual which provides legal aid to imprisoned gang members and their families, was also accused  —   but not arrested  —   of using his organisation as a front to shield gang activities.

Congress passes $1.1bn Zika bill days before government shutdown deadline
Congress has addressed the Zika funding crisis and finalized a deal to fund the government just days ahead of a shutdown deadline. The legislation passed on Wednesday night extends existing spending levels a mere 10 weeks, past election day, while finally addressing the Zika crisis with $1. 1bn and providing   help for the residents of Flint, Michigan, as well as flood victims in Louisiana. After a   burst of   the legislation passed the Senate on a   vote Wednesday and was backed by the House   in a   vote. It was a conclusion in sight and within reach since lawmakers returned from their summer recess just after Labor Day. But with the Capitol awash in   politics and shadowed by the contentious presidential race and engulfed in a fierce battle for control of the Senate, the simplest task became a nearly impossible heavy lift impeded by needless delays and bitter  . Republicans, defending a fragile Senate majority and eager to get a handful of vulnerable incumbents back home to campaign for   accused the minority leader, Harry Reid, of holding up a deal to keep GOP lawmakers off the campaign trail. “The Democrats are determined to keep us here as long as they can,” said one   Republican senator, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. Democrats denied it but lobbed their own allegations, all but accusing Republicans of racism for holding up money for people affected by   water in predominantly black Flint, the final sticking point in the talks. “All they’d have to do is put Flint in and we’d be out of here in a minute. We want to get out of here. They’re the ones holding it up,” said Democratic senator Chuck Schumer of New York. Compromise on a $170m Flint aid package ultimately gave Democrats a partial victory while the   Louisiana delegation won a down payment on Barack Obama’s $2. 6bn request for their state. The Zika deal was the resolution of a long and vexing dispute on that issue after Obama made his initial request for federal money in February. The situation produced frustration all around as lawmakers of both parties lamented their inability to get their basic work done, even as each party insisted the other was to blame. The gridlock that has kept Congress’s approval ratings below 20% for years was on vivid display at a moment when the electorate has made crystal clear that it wants an end to Washington’s dysfunction and inability to address the many real problems confronting the nation. Yet even as they stumbled to a messy solution at close to the last possible moment  —   the deadline was midnight on Friday  —   some lawmakers were already looking ahead to next year, when much weightier tasks await the next Congress and a new president in what may be an even more fraught era of divided government. A   budget deal agreed to a year ago under the former House speaker, Republican John Boehner, pushed a number of major issues into next year, in particular the next fight over raising the government’s borrowing limit. The debt limit will need to be raised by around   of next year, something that has provoked major     battles among the Capitol’s warring factions and the administration in recent years. Lawmakers will need to revisit major programs that are ripe for battles including the Children’s Health Insurance Program under Medicaid, payments to hospitals and community health centers, expiring tax credits for a range of industries, a reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration, the annual defense policy bill, as well as the annual budgeting process. And there is a vacancy to fill on the supreme court. This year, even though getting the appropriations process on track was a top goal for the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Congress deadlocked and could not get a budget done while passing just one of the 12 annual spending bills that fund government agencies. The rest of them will need to be lumped together in what’s sure to be another messy struggle in the   session after the election. Regardless of whether the next president is Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, the White House will confront numerous tricky   on Capitol Hill next year. Whichever party controls the Senate, the majority is likely to be   and senators will probably be focused immediately on the 2018 midterms, when Democrats will be defending tough seats in red states. In the   House, the number of   House Republicans is likely to be reduced, potentially giving more power to the House Freedom Caucus, which frequently opposes routine legislation and impedes   by leadership. Ryan himself is widely seen as having presidential ambitions in 2020, which may complicate his willingness to cut deals with Clinton or Trump. Yet with the outcome of the election uncertain, many lawmakers said it remained to be seen whether a new Congress might provide an opening for more productive relations in Washington, or more of the same. “It depends on what kind of message the voters send,” said Democratic senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii. “If they express enough frustration I think you’ll have members understanding that they have a responsibility to govern. But the voters have to hold us accountable and it remains to be seen whether or not they will. ”

Defense secretary Ash Carter meets leaders in Iraq amid fight for Mosul
US defense secretary Ash Carter arrived in Baghdad on Sunday to meet American commanders and Iraqi leaders and to assess progress in the fight to retake the northern city of Mosul from Islamic State militants. The unannounced visit came as Iraqi security forces have been slowed in their nearly    offensive against Isis, which has occupied Mosul for more than two years. Carter flew into Baghdad aboard a military cargo plane. He was scheduled to meet with the prime minister, Haider   as well as top US and coalition commanders. In Bahrain on Saturday, Carter announced he was sending another 200 troops to Syria to train and advise local fighters combatting Isis. There were already 300 US troops authorized for the Syria effort, and some 5, 000 in Iraq. The recapture of Mosul, the country’s   city, is crucial to Iraqi hopes of restoring sovereignty, although political stability will probably remain a challenge. Carter told an international security conference in Bahrain that the battle for Mosul and for the Syrian city of Raqqa, the de facto capital of the extremists’   caliphate, would be crucial for defeating the group, which has claimed attacks worldwide. “The seizure of these two cities is necessary to ensure the destruction of Isil’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria  —   the primary objective of our military campaign  —   and put Isil on an irreversible path to a lasting defeat,” he said, using another acronym for Isis. He did not predict how long it might take for Iraqi forces to prevail in Mosul, but he sounded a note of optimism. “This is a complex mission that will take time to accomplish, but I am confident that Isil’s days in Mosul are numbered,” he said in Bahrain. Iraqi forces have only captured a handful of eastern Mosul neighborhoods since launching the offensive in  . On Sunday they came under mortar fire as they worked to clear villages along the Tigris river to the south, part of operations to secure supply lines for a campaign that is likely to stretch into the coming year. Carter, whose tenure as defense secretary will end in January if his designated successor  —   the retired marine general James Mattis  —   is confirmed by the Senate as expected, also made the case for keeping US forces in Iraq even after Isis is dislodged from Mosul. “Beyond security, there will still be towns to rebuild, services to   and communities to restore,” he said in Bahrain. The extremists, he predicted, would attempt to survive by reinventing themselves “in some other shape or form” after they lose their grip on Iraq and Syria. Left unsaid was a possible change in course under Donald Trump when he takes office next month.

A Strong Exit, a new play by James Graham
Dramatis Personae, Minister for Brexit Male, 40s, Tory MP  Permanent Secretary Female, 50s, from the Cabinet Office  Dale Special adviser, 30s, Erica Special adviser, 30s, Whitehall, London, 2016.  . The offices of the hastily established Ministry for Brexit. A large map of Europe on the back wall. A screen showing global market activity. The newly appointed Minister for Brexit is greeting his team of   Spads, Erica and Dale, alongside the department’s new Permanent Secretary.  Minister (looking around) Christ, why are we in this mess?  Dale It’s what people voted for. Minister No, I mean these offices. What a dump. Permanent Secretary  The civil service thought a “staggered” approach to establishing this new ministry was the best course of action, Minister. Hence finding you some makeshift rooms here underneath the Cabinet Office.  Minister  Under the watchful eyes of mother, is it? Right.   well, the White House may have the Situation Room. But this little bunker of ours will be our new Situation Command. And this “ ” is going to  —   ah, right, no, that won’t work, we’ll have to —    Dale  It’s all right, I’m on it (typing on his Blackberry). Erica  Can I introduce the Permanent Secretary assigned here by the Cabinet Office. Permanent Secretary (shaking his hand) Congratulations on your appointment.  Minister Said through slightly gritted teeth, I expect.  Permanent Secretary  Not at all, my role is to be impartial. I’m not a political appointment.  Minister  But you were the civil servant who helped draft that whole “This government believes in remaining” booklet thing, right? Hardly impartial. Permanent Secretary  If by that you mean it laid out the expert analysis of the independent institutions that run and service the British economy, its national security, international relations and other historic functions, then yes.  Minister  Well, let’s not go into all that again, it’s been three torturous and bruising months. Some of the most difficult in our history. But we must put it all behind us, and deliver the will of the people. Most of the people. At least, what their will was a couple of weeks ago, whatever it may be now. Some of them. (Claps his hands) Anyway.  Permanent Secretary To that end, Minister   …      She gestures to a box on a desk in the centre of the room.  Some other official looking Civil Servants enter. They insert their keys into the locks in the desk. The Permanent Secretary does likewise. On her nod, they turn their keys simultaneously.  The box opens with a hiss, revealing a small Red Button. The Minister approaches it, uncertainly   …     Minister What is this thing before me   …    ?  Permanent Secretary In order to invoke Article 50, Minister, all 28 member states of the   …     apologies, force of habit, all 27 member states of the European Council must be simultaneously informed of the decision by the British government to leave. This mechanism, as designed by the civil service, alerts all necessary domestic and foreign bodies of that decision so that the article may be immediately invoked. Once triggered   …     a clock begins its countdown, impossible to stop once it starts. Two years precisely to gather up our things and get out.  Parliament has no say. The decision alone rests with the royal prerogative of the government. It’s up to you to decide if, and when, to press the trigger. Sir.  Minister (looks at the button. It almost seems to glow. His hand, half drawn to it.) Many a man and woman were called upon to push it   …     and all were found wanting. Now those players have all departed the stage. And so it falls to me   …      Well, I will push. And push hard. When the time is right. For as soon as we do, we reveal our hand and the tables are turned against us. I will to Europe go! And negotiate the best terms while we still have our trump card to play. Erica Maybe don’t call it a Trump card. Minister No, good call. Dale We have to get you over to Newsnight in 25, sir.  Minister All right. Blue tie, cufflinks? I have a travel toothbrush somewhere —    A general sorting of the Minister as he gets ready.  Erica Shall we prep a little?  Minister Yes, what am I saying  —   uh, “very honoured, weight of responsibility” blah blah. Er, “The new Prime Minister, in her first day behind the controls —  ”  Erica May day! May day!  Minister Erica, don’t. “I am aware that”  —   oh, I just got it  —   “I’m aware that I am the first ever minister appointed to this position, and hopefully the last”  —   mmm, I’ll work on that bit  —   “I’ve been given the job of drafting the future of a nation, in the biggest decision ever undertaken by a free people within our lifetimes. ” Er, what else  —   ah, the new ministry. Well, “Yes, we may be a small unit. And not everyone gives us much hope of success. But  —   I know a plucky little country in not that dissimilar a position. ” Dale Nice. Minister Thank you  —   er, “one that also just extricated itself from a, a difficult marriage. Something I happen to have some experience of. ” Erica Good  —   personal experience, human, in touch. Minister (brushing his teeth while he rehearses) And, yes, it can be scary. As the one leaving the nest, the other side gets to keep the home and the car and the kids  —   sure. But there are new homes to find, new kids to, to  —   have. And yeah it can be scary to hit the dating scene again  —   you’re a little longer in the tooth, a little thinner in the wallet. And, yes, there’s an awful moment you realise everyone else is already in a relationship with someone else. But that’s OK. Solitude is underrated. And there are other ways to get what you need, to find satisfaction, enjoyment. I’ve lost my train of thought.  Dale Doesn’t matter, let’s move on. Minister Exactly. “Moving on”  —   I like that actually. That’s one of the problems with “exit” as a term. Arriving is, is triumphant. Exiting is failure. Erica The inevitable day we’re called upon to quit, headlines write themselves. “Fire Brexits. ”  Dale “Brexiting under a cloud. ” Erica “Where are the signs for the nearest Brexit?”  Dale “Be warned, the nearest Brexit may be behind you. ”  Permanent Secretary That one’s almost certainly true.  Dale (on his Blackberry) Car’s on its way. Two minutes.  Erica   a few interview questions?  Minister Mm, good idea.  An interview setup arranged, the Minister still brushing his teeth, sorting his tie and so on. Erica acting as the interviewer.  Erica Minister, as a vocal Brexiteer, you must be pleased to be playing your part.  Minister Mmm, yes, certainly, I  —   I may not be as, as colourful a character as some of the others. And I can’t say that I was a leading part of all campaign areas, but unlike others it’s fair to say I, like, led some.  Dale Don’t say “I like Leadsom. ” Minister What? Oh right, yes. Good spot, Dale. Erica And you are going to trigger Article 50? Minister That’s the will of the people. Erica The winning side only won by a margin of 3. 8%.  Minister Brexit is going to happen. And that requires Article 50.  Erica But when, minister? This uncertainty has wiped billions off Britain’s shares, billions off GDP, equivalent to the cost of many years of EU membership that leaving was intended to save. A bull stock market has quickly become a bear market, tanking at the rate of —    Minister Ah, yes, you see, but you know the thing about bears, is that, is that, when you see one, the advice is not to run, but to make yourself as big and as loud as possible, to scare it away. Or at least, that’s the case with one type of bear, there’s a difference between black and brown, I think, the other one you’re meant to shrivel up into a ball and cower, but, but I forget which —    (looking at Dale) Can we Google that, check which one’s which, if I’m going to say it —   Dale I don’t think you should say it —    Minister No, but if I am I don’t want to be giving bad bear advice on live TV. That could come back and bite me on the arse. Quite literally. Anyway —   Erica Time is at a premium, Minister, the Council of Europe is meeting right now in Brussels. They’re losing patience. There’s even talk of them triggering their Article 7, kicking us out immediately without any terms whatsoever.  Minister That’s scaremongering. It’ll never happen. To justify that, a majority of member states have to believe that we pose a real threat to the values and existence of the union, and I don’t think any reasonable person thinks that.  Erica You can’t be certain. No one has ever triggered Article 50 before.  Minister Exactly, and the fact that no one knows how to do it is actually quite helpful. Erica You’re saying no one knows what they’re doing?  Minister No, it isn’t that no one knows what they’re doing, it’s just that  —   no one knows quite what to do. There’s a difference between those two positions. Not huge, admittedly —    Erica Like 3. 8%? Minister Exactly, not huge, but it, it makes all the difference, entirely, to everyone, and everything, for ever   …     Look, a lot of people keep saying we should sleep on this. Well, my message to them, to quote a former colleague, is, “You kip if you want to —  ” Dale Not “Ukip”. Minister Right, you  —   hmm, go back on that one. Erica You agree with the new PM when she says, “Brexit means Brexit. ”  Minister Absolutely, yes, yes, though of course for “Brexit to mean Brexit” and rightly so, no question, we first have to work out what   …     what Brexit means. Don’t we? In order for Brexit to mean, to mean “that”.  Erica Shouldn’t you have worked out what it meant before people voted for it?  Minister Oh, no, you misunderstand me. We knew what it meant then. When people voted. Obviously. But ever since people voted to Brexit, everything’s just got thrown up in the air, hasn’t it? You know, including   …     Brexit   …     (turning around to his team) Hard this, isn’t it? Dale and Erica Nooo, you’ll be fine.  Erica Car’s downstairs.  Minister OK, wish me luck.  Dale Remember, just end on a zinger.  Minister You don’t have to tell me that: it’s been my political maxim all my life. (Putting on his jacket) No one will remember how you got there. But they’ll sure as hell remember the manner in which you leave.  He winks, and exits.  Permanent Secretary Right, if you’ll excuse me, I have about a hundred thousand new positions to fill. (Taking her files) You have to find some humour in the irony, I suppose. Extricating ourselves over the next two years will require the civil service to expand exponentially to fill the legislative tasks currently administered and financed by Brussels. A vote to “return democracy to the people” is about to trigger the largest and most expensive surrender of   capabilities from elected representatives to an unelected bureaucratic elite in modern times. Que sera sera. If I’m still able to use casual French.  Dale Look, I know we were on different sides of the war, but we must both be on the winning side of the peace.  Permanent Secretary There’s a winning side? Dale I get it. You’re angry  —   Permanent Secretary (turning on him) I’m not angry. I’ve   …     I spent my life, here, working, here, yearning, fucking praying, for the return of “ideas” telling young people, my daughter’s age, that politics doesn’t just have to be the preservation of the status quo, it can be a place of ideas, the potential for change. Well honestly, honestly, I miss the old days. When the worst you could accuse politics of being was boring. I miss boring. And I hate that that’s what this has done to me. That all I want for my children is a return to boring. For them. That I might find a way, somehow, to make life boring again. And I hate that that’s what this has done to me   …       …     that’s all. A phone in the office starts to ring. And then another. And then all of them   …     Dale That   …     that doesn’t sound good. Has something happened? Erica (checking her phone). Oh Jesus. The Council. They’re voting! Voting on Article 7.  Dale No, bollocks, what? Permanent Secretary (checking her phone) Belgium called a vote. Erica Shit, get the Minister back, get him back. Dale I’m trying, I’m trying  —   it’s engaged! Permanent Secretary France has voted yes. Erica What do we do?  Permanent Secretary Now Germany. Dale How many do they need to push their trigger?!  Permanent Secretary A majority, 17.  Erica Spain   …     Italy   …     Dale We have to trigger ours before they trigger theirs, it’s our only hope  —   push it! Permanent Secretary What? We’re not authorised to do that.  Dale No one is! It’s our only hope.  Erica Greece! Portugal!  Dale Erica, push it!  Erica No way, I’m not having my fingerprints on that!  Permanent Secretary Denmark!  Dale Someone do it! Someone do it! Trigger, trigger!  The noise of the phones, alarms, and screaming becomes deafening.  Erica and Dale can’t take it and make a run for it  —   leaving the Permanent Secretary alone by the button. They shoot one guilty look back at her before exiting. Blackout.  • This House by James Graham is at the Minerva theatre, Chichester, from 23 September to 29 October, and then at the Garrick theatre, London, from 19 November.

Mark Singer on Trump: ’The wheels are starting to come off dramatically’
The first time I interview Mark Singer it’s the Tuesday after the Republican national convention, which culminated with a Donald Trump speech Singer accurately describes as “scripted insanity”. Things feel pretty bleak. Trump’s candidacy, says Singer, is “the most cynical and truly sad thing that’s ever happened in my life in this country, and I’ve lived through assassinations and terrible wars, but that it has led to this  —   it’s a mixture of every awful emotion. If we elect this man it’s the end of a lot of things, I just don’t know how that happens. With a whimper perhaps  —   I hope not a bang. ” Born in 1950, Singer has been a writer for the New Yorker since 1974 (“There was no reason to leave,” he tells me as we sit outside a café near his home on Manhattan’s Upper East Side). In 1996, his then editor Tina Brown commissioned him to write a profile of Trump with the words “He’s totally full of shit, you’ll love him!” After months getting a full immersion into Trump’s world, one highlight being a ludicrous meeting between Trump and Aleksandr Lebed, in which Trump proudly showed the Russian general and Kremlin fixer a shoe he’d been given by Shaquille O’Neal  —   Singer wrote a   profile that nailed the narcissism, superficiality and cynicism with which the world is now so alarmingly familiar. It concluded that Trump had “aspired to and achieved the ultimate luxury, an existence unmolested by the rumbling of a soul”. Naturally, Trump didn’t appreciate Singer’s efforts, attacking him in his book Trump: the Art of the Comeback, in a letter to the New York Times (“he was not born with great writing ability”) and finally in an irate missive that read: “Mark, you are a total loser! And your book (and writings) sucks!”  These last two sentences are proudly printed on the back of Singer’s new book Trump and Me, which revisits his profile in the light of Trump’s presidential campaign. Given Singer’s probing wit and Trump’s essential ridiculousness, it is very funny, though the implications of a Trump presidency seem increasingly less amusing in the light of the hatred he has unleashed. “I am afraid. Everybody I know is afraid,” Singer says. “If Hillary Clinton wins, listening to the sigh of relief just on this island, we might have a carbon dioxide overload crisis. You’ll see these trees shooting up. ”  Singer says that Trump is “the most unapologetic   …     there has to be a word stronger than hypocrite, there really does. ” He is despairing that some voters  —   stoked by the email scandal and the WikiLeaks revelations about her attempts to undermine Bernie Sanders  —   think Hillary Clinton is more dishonest than Trump. This, he says, “is what really makes you want to blow your brains out. It makes you want to go back and find patient zero and think, when was the moment where we stopped being willing to fund public education in this country, that it became so egregious that we no longer could have people who understood the constitution, the checks and balances? Trump says: ‘I love the  .’ You bet he does. ”  Singer blames Fox News and the web for what seems to be a growing disregard for the truth, but also acknowledges that widening inequality, leaving a large swathe of Americans essentially abandoned by the two main parties, has helped account for Trump’s rise  —   along with “the haters” racists and xenophobes excited by this promises to keep Mexicans and Muslims out of America.  Nevertheless, he can’t bring himself to picture Trump actually being elected. “Imagine November 9, 2016. You wake up and there it is in the newspaper, Donald Trump has been elected president. He’s not going to institute martial law yet, he’s not going to abridge the first amendment just yet, he’s not going to seal the borders  —   he can’t do anything until January 20. This will be the beginning of a series of anni horobili that we’ve never seen. ” Singer cites a recent obituary of a friend’s aunt, which concluded: “Died of complications of congestive heart failure and the 2016 presidential election. ” Like her, he says, “I think that you’re going to see a lot of people who’ve been hanging on, letting go. I believe that. And a lot of them are going to be envied. ” Just a week later, however, things look very different. Trump is plunging in the polls, largely thanks to his typically impetuous and politically suicidal decision to attack Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of US army captain Humayun Khan, who was killed in the Iraq war. “You have sacrificed nothing,” Khan said of Trump in his speech at the DNC, a line devastating because it is so   true, and one to which Trump was stupid enough to respond, telling ABC: “I think I’ve made a lot of sacrifices. ”  “That almost made me embarrassed for humanity,” says Singer when I call him a few days after Trump’s   performance. “I don’t really lump myself in the same humanity that possibly he belongs to. ” Singer says the Khan episode “showed Donald Trump in his quintessence”. Even the rightwing political commentator Bill O’Reilly, he says, “who’s a bomb thrower” told Trump on his Fox show that you don’t attack a   mother. “Trump is saying: ‘Well yeah, but’  —   and then he says, as plain as day, ‘I didn’t attack her.’ And right after he says that he says: ‘I was viciously attacked.’ This demonstrates as plainly as anything that he’s a person who lies reflexively. ” Now Trump seems to be flailing. “He’s shocked,” Singer says. “He’s in a tailspin because his ego is constructed in a way that does not brook any kind of disagreement. He has his own party telling him, ‘Dude, shut the fuck up. Do not go there.’ These are people like Rudy Guiliani and Newt Gingrich, this is not Nancy Pelosi, OK? He hears them, he goes out and the next day does it again. ” This reckless behaviour has had many commentators wondering whether Trump is suffering from a mental illness. Last week, Singer participated in an extraordinary discussion on MSNBC’s The Last Word With Lawrence O’Donnell with Dr George Simon, a psychologist described on his website as “the leading expert on manipulators and other disturbed characters”. To be diagnosed with a narcissistic personality disorder, you need to exhibit five of around a dozen symptoms on a checklist, such as “Has a grandiose sense of  ” and “lacks empathy”. However, the entire list seemed to apply to Trump.  “His mental illness is now the conversation,” Singer says. There are tricky ethical issues around such a   diagnosis  —   not least, he says, the fact that comparing them to Trump may further stigmatize sufferers. “It’s extremely unfair to people who have various mental illnesses. ”  Singer says that even mental illness can’t entirely account for Trump’s behaviour. “You can’t believe that this is somebody capable of this degree of obtuseness, obliviousness, total absence of   and cruelty. This combination. Since you and I spoke the other day, that has blown open and he’s really done. So now the headlines are, what’s the party going to do? They’ve got to do something. They’re almost conceding the election now, two weeks after their convention!” Singer even made a bet last Monday with Jane Mayer, a New Yorker colleague, that Trump would be gone in two weeks. “The wheels are starting to come off so dramatically and you can feel it. ”  Given his plunging popularity, Singer says it’s no surprise that Trump is now claiming that the election will be rigged. “It’s in the book,” he points out. “The thing that he’s dreaded most in his life is being labeled a loser. So he has to have an explanation for that. ”  In the shorter term, Singer says, Trump’s next big challenge will be the debates  —   or more specially, how he can avoid them. As Trump has demonstrated many times, for instance recently claiming that Russia would not invade Ukraine, when Russian soldiers occupied Crimea over two years ago, when it comes to events beyond America’s borders he is profoundly ignorant. “Exactly right,” Singer says. “By choice and temperament both. And this is a person who brags: ‘I know more about Isis than the generals.’ This party has this quote on record when they nominated him. Guess who I don’t have a whole lot of sympathy for? It’s game over. ” Given the warp speed at which the news has moved this year however, Singer rows back: “That is the kind of stuff that is so dangerous to say I should bite my tongue. ” Trump, says Singer, is the most transparent politician there has ever been: “He’s only out for himself, in every way, in every gesture. ” One of the reasons for publishing his book, he says, was in disgust at the way journalists indulged Trump’s race for the presidency because it was good for ratings and traffic. “This notion of false equivalency is not something that journalists have figured out, but it wasn’t even that with Trump, it was just the celebrity and [him] using up all the oxygen. But I knew that Trump had no intention of winning, it was obvious  —   and here we are. ” As for many Americans, the Trump candidacy has been a draining experience for Singer. No one can turn away, Singer least of all. “I just sat here and I was watching MSNBC last night until 11 o’clock and I realized, I am now an addict. I’m totally a junkie and I really need to have an intervention of my own, I’m afraid. ” That sets him off on another Trumpian train of thought  —   those in the Republican party who think they can perform some kind of intervention. “This idea of doing an intervention with Trump is hilarious to me. These might be the last optimists in America. ” You can’t treat people like Trump, he says. “They’re incurable. ”

Experience: I broke my neck on a night out
In autumn 2006, I’d just returned from a year of travelling after getting a first in economics at the University of Birmingham. I was 21, living back with my parents near Southampton and two weeks into a graduate position at the accountancy firm, KPMG. The future could not have looked brighter. I went back to Birmingham to catch up with some friends. After a curry, we headed back to the student union for old times’ sake. There had been an open day on campus so the fountain was on. I got the idea to jump in, and tried to persuade everyone to join me. We had had a few beers but we weren’t wrecked  —   it was just a laugh. At the end of the night, a mate and I decided to go for it. We ran towards it, but while he jumped in, I, for some reason, put my arms over my head and did a racing dive. I remember lying face down in the water, thinking, “OK, time to get out now,” but my legs wouldn’t work. I tried to use my arms to push myself out, but that wasn’t going to happen, either. I had just worked out that I couldn’t roll over when the security guard pulled me out. I was lying there, facing the sky, thinking, “This feels quite serious. ” The paramedics arrived and in the ambulance it dawned on me that I was paralysed. But it didn’t occur to me for one moment that it would be permanent. I couldn’t feel anything from the chest down. Within half an hour I was shown my spinal   in hospital. The doctor pointed to where my neck was broken. The bone was crushing my spinal cord. I asked him if I would walk again, and he told me he doubted it. I hadn’t got my head around the situation because one of the first things I did was call in sick to work. I told them, “Don’t worry, everything is going to be OK, but I’ve broken my neck and I’m paralysed. ” They called my parents and said, “Concentrate on getting him better, then we’ll help him get back to work. ” I fought hard to be optimistic, but I had to accept that I would use a wheelchair for the rest of my life. I couldn’t really do anything by myself and I will always need someone to wash and dress me. There were some very dark days, but I had something to work towards. Knowing my job was waiting for me gave me a purpose. Rehab was hard, but I stayed focused. At about six weeks I was able to sit in a wheelchair for about 25 minutes. I sat for a few more minutes each day, but it was excruciating. It must have been so hard for my family. I remember my parents watching me trying to take Wotsits crisps out of the bag, spilling them everywhere. After nine months, I could move around in a wheelchair. I went to live with my parents, and exactly one year after the accident I started work. I gradually increased my hours until, two years after the accident, I was able to start back on the graduate scheme. I passed my professional exams, but the need to reduce my workload meant I couldn’t excel. After a secondment, I got a job as a senior lecturer in accountancy at Southampton Solent University, which was a real boost. I also set up a wheelchair rugby club: returning to a sporting life was an important step. I went on to take a post at Southampton Business School, where I am now a senior teaching fellow. I’d put off thinking about relationships because I wanted to get to a point where my spinal injury was one of the least interesting things about me. But over time, I began to feel ready. I met Laura two years ago and now we are married. Proposing wasn’t easy  —   I wanted to do it on holiday, but I needed help hiding the ring. I ended up asking her over a takeout pizza. I feel lucky. I love my job, I play sport, and I have this incredible woman in my life. I do wonder what would have happened if I hadn’t dived into the fountain. If I could wake up and not be disabled, of course I would take that. But I wouldn’t undo my accident. I’ve achieved so much. And not everything has been despite the accident  —   some things have actually been because of it. • As told to Tillie Harris, Do you have an experience to share? Email experience@theguardian. com

You’ve Been Trumped Too review – this is what a Trump win would look like
The polls tighten. The fear rises. And there could hardly be a more urgent or relevant film than this. Five years ago, British director Anthony Baxter made a Michael   documentary about the obnoxious arrogance of Donald J Trump, who was vandalising a coastline of natural beauty near Aberdeen to build a golf course, in so doing making promises on job creation and finding a useful idiot in Alex Salmond, who had rolled over with the necessary political permissions. In the course of all this, Trump’s building workers had cut off the water supply to an elderly, courageous widow, Mrs Molly Forbes, and her son Michael. The Forbes family had refused to sell up. Now, five years later, Baxter has returned to find this water supply has still not been restored. The point about Trump’s grisly Scottish adventure is that it’s a very real dummy run for what he would be like as an international statesman in the arena of politics and diplomacy. Of course he is a mendacious sociopath, and he has far too easily coerced   UK officials into doing his bidding. When Trump talks about bringing the private business style into politics, this is what he means: corporate lawyers attacking local communities and breaking promises on jobs, supposedly the cornerstone of what passes for Trump’s political vision. What on earth is Nicola Sturgeon doing about this? Or Scottish Secretary David Mundell? Whatever happens in the US presidential election, it is time for them to stand up for Mrs Molly Forbes.

Faith No More’s Mike Patton talks about new side project tētēma: ’It’s very, very tricky’
The   Australian composer and pianist Anthony Pateras doesn’t get a chance to speak to   renowned vocal prodigy and Faith No More frontman Mike Patton very often. Patton admits this makes him feel “nervous and scared” given the pair will be performing together, as duo, tētēma, in less than two months time in a   show at the Mona Festival of Music and Art (Mona Foma) in Hobart, Australia. When they speak to each other during an interview with Guardian Australia, there is catching up to be done first. They last time they spoke was in June. “Where the fuck are you, Anthony?” Patton asks. “You’re in fucking Sydney? Get the fuck out of here. I’m surprised. Usually you’re like, in Berlin. ” Patton explains that between now and their performance together in January, “there’s no way we’re going to be on the same piece of the Earth together”. Patton is renowned for being a workaholic and taking on multiple projects at once, such as touring with his multitude of bands that include Fantomas and Tomahawk, writing film scores, or collaborating with artists ranging from     John Zorn to Norwegian   John Kaada. Pateras, too, is constantly on the move, touring with various bands and improvisational groups, writing concert works for orchestras, ensembles and soloists, and running the text and music project, Immediata. “My relationship with Anthony is always very intercontinental, you know?” Patton says. “But I love this guy. I love him. ”  Pateras, the more considered of the pair, explains that much of their collaboration as tētēma is done over email. In 2014 tētēma released their album, Geocidal  —   an   mix of exotic percussion, strings, symphonic winds and rock synths, punctuated by Patton’s vocals  —   which took about four years to complete.  “That was years of swapping stuff back and forth over email and building on it over an extended period,” Pateras says. “It took a long time. The drums were recorded in Paris, clarinets in Santiago, the brass in Berlin. And eventually we met together in San Francisco for three days to do the rest, and we mixed it in Brussels. ” Pateras needed Patton to do the vocals because “there were not really any other options,” he says. Patton, with a vocal range of six octaves, has appeared at the top of lists like world’s most versatile vocalist and world’s best vocalist, ahead of Guns N’ Roses’ Axl Rose and avant garde soprano Diamanda Galás. While Patton laughs dismissively at such descriptors, the fact remains, Pateras says, that “in terms of the arrangements and orchestration for tētēma, there’s not many singers qualified to actually handle it”. “Mike has the avant garde sensibility, the orchestral sensibility, the rock sensibility and the   sensibility to deal with this kind of material, and those are all angles and histories I like to address in the music. “A key thing which I feel Mike can actually do is have that compositional logic while remaining free and open to the moment. So we work around our respective schedules and make it work because we both love the work so much. ” It’s this versatility that has seen Patton croon 1950s and 60s Italian pop under the moniker Mondo Cane, use his voice as both an instrument and a noise machine with experimental rock band Mr Bungle, and beatbox for Björk on her Medúlla album. Pateras describes Patton as the rare type of artist who can perform a complex song all the way through in one take.  “Musicians today kind of piece things together gradually, and then a take is put together in an edited way,” he says. “But Mike is part of a generation of musicians who can do the take all the way through and there’s a certain feel and discipline to that, which a lot of musicians today are not aware of. That discipline and focus in a take is increasingly rare and is a privilege to witness, and that’s what I really admire in Mike. ” Patton responds that while his first takes are “usually pretty fucking good” he is more than happy to take advantage of technology to clean up a   rhythm or redo parts. Despite his vocal prowess, Patton says the idea of performing live with tētēma is challenging. The Geocidal album, which explored the concept of “the murder of place” and which Patton had wrongly assumed would be a piano and vocals record, is full of foreboding landscapes fuelled by an array of erratic instrumentals.  “It’s very, very tricky. It’s the kind of music that makes me go, ‘Sheesh   …     there’s no easy way of doing this,’” Patton says. “So you have to figure out a way. You make a record and the record is beautiful but when you want to present it live, it’s a whole other mindset. ” The pair are also producing new material separate to Geocidal to perform for Mona Foma, which will, by necessity, be slightly more contained.  “The notion of a traditional band doesn’t really function for us,” Pateras says. “So for Mona we had quite a long conversation about how we could do this live and that took a while to establish   …     a year and a half or something. It’s a little less spiralling outwards. ”  • tētēma is performing on the Mona main stage at Mona Foma on 21 January

Derrick Rose rape trial: LAPD detective’s apparent suicide complicates case
The apparent suicide of a Los Angeles police department detective who was investigating a rape allegation against NBA star Derrick Rose is a dramatic turn that has injected uncertainty into the lawsuit against him. News that Nadine Hernandez had been found dead jolted the civil trial on Wednesday and opened a potentially new legal front in the closely watched case.  Officers found Hernandez, 44, suffering from a single gunshot wound to the chest on Tuesday afternoon in a home in Whittier, about 20 miles   of downtown LA, according to the Whittier police department. She was ferried to PIH Health Hospital where she died at 3. 27pm. There was no sign of foul play, a Whittier police spokesman said. “This incident is being investigated as a suicide. However, this is an ongoing investigation. ” The news added a macabre twist on what was already a dramatic day in the US district court where a woman is seeking $21. 5m compensation for allegedly being raped by Rose and two of his friends.  The    alleged victim, known as Jane Doe, appeared shocked when Mark Baute, a lawyer for Rose, made the announcement. Baute, who has mounted a combative defense of the New York Knicks point guard, told the court that the detective had told him “there’s no rape case here” and had alerted him to potentially damning texts from Doe to Rose which her lawyers had withheld from the defense. During a break in the trial one of Doe’s lawyers, Brandon Anand, told journalists the detective had in fact believed there was a case: “She unequivocally stated that a crime had been committed. ” He said the detective had visited Doe at her parents’ home in northern California less than a month ago. The contradictory versions added an extra layer of dispute in a highly charged trial which has shined a fresh light on the judicial system’s handling of sexual assault cases. Rose, 28, and two friends, Randall Hampton and Ryan Allen, are accused of raping Doe while she was intoxicated in her LA apartment in the early hours of 27 August 2013. The defendants admit taking turns having sex with her but say it was consensual. America’s latest collision of celebrity and alleged sexual assault is playing out in civil litigation, not criminal trial. If the defendants lose they will be ordered to pay damages but not go to jail or have a criminal conviction. The LAPD’s criminal investigation remains open, however, and Hernandez was among the officers monitoring the trial for evidence that could trigger a criminal prosecution. The LAPD said she was one of two detectives assigned to the Rose case. “At this point there is no indication that her casework had any connection to her death,” a statement said. “The Rose investigation will continue unimpeded. ” Law enforcement sources told the Los Angeles Times the house where Hernandez was found belonged to a relative, and that property records showed it registered to a retired LAPD lieutenant. Hernandez’s involvement in the Rose case became publicly known last month when Doe’s lawyers cited her in an attempt to protect Doe’s anonymity.  Shielding alleged rape victims’ identities was an “an invaluable investigative aid to investigators” the detective wrote in a letter that lawyers submitted to federal Judge Michael Fitzgerald. However the judge ruled that the anonymity granted to Doe after she filed the lawsuit last year would end when the trial began last week in the interest of openness and of not prejudicing the jury. Her name has been cited in testimony and court documents, but most media outlets have refrained from reporting it. Lawyers for Rose, the youngest player ever to win the NBA’s Most Valuable Player award, asked the judge to dismiss the case because Doe’s legal team had withheld some deleted texts she sent Rose on the night of the alleged rape.  Judge Fitzgerald rejected the mistrial motion on Wednesday but instructed the jury of six women and two men to draw an adverse inference because of the lapse. “Plaintiff failed in her legal obligation to respond fully to the lawful discovery demands. These texts could be viewed by the jury as being helpful to the defense. They are at a minimum consistent with the defense’s theory of this action. ” Doe and Rose had dated on and off for two years before the alleged assault. On the night of 26 August 2013 Doe went with a female friend to Rose’s Beverly Hills home. She became inebriated and after midnight took a taxi back to her apartment. Rose, Hampton and Allen arrived there a short time later, had intercourse with her and left. The case hinges on whether she gave consent. In one of the deleted texts, sent at 1. 36am after Doe left Rose’s home and before he arrived at her apartment, she told Rose her friend was angry he had not had sex with her. “She was mad at me babe. Why you have me bring a bitch and you ain’t finna [sic] fuck her. ” The defense contends Doe concocted the rape accusation to get rich. Hampton, Rose’s   testified that he and the basketball star both had sex with Doe at Rose’s home before the alleged rape at her apartment later. The third defendant, Allen, was due to testify later on Wednesday. Last week Doe testified that she when she got home she vomited, passed out on her bed and drifted in and out of consciousness while the three men had sex with her. She said she woke with her dress around her neck, lubricant on her legs, a burning sensation between her legs and condoms around the bed.

There ain’t no resignation like a Nigel Farage resignation
A Nigel Farage resignation is for Christmas, but not for life. Even before the Ukip leader finished the event announcing he was stepping down, Nigel was already softening his stance so much it feels more prudent to cast this as a sabbatical. Think of it as Glenn Close going under the bathwater in Fatal Attraction. You know she’s going to rear back up soon enough. Or, as Nigel put it about the possibility of returning as party leader in time for the 2020 general election: “Let’s see. Let’s see where we are in two and a half years’ time. ” Farage has, of course, resigned twice before. Outside the room in the evangelical centre where he made the   speech, there was a huge wall inscription reading: “THOU SHALT HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE ME”. What about Douglas Carswell, the party’s only MP? “Get down to the bookies if you want,” sniffed Farage, “but I wouldn’t put too much money on it if I were you. ” Informed that Carswell had tweeted a smiling emoji shortly after news of his standing down, Nigel replied: “I’m pleased that he’s smiling, because that’s not something I’ve seen very often. ” There were the usual ironicidal moments. Of Britain’s lack of qualified trade negotiators to handle Brexit, Nigel observed: “I’m told we haven’t got the skills. So let’s headhunt them. Let’s get them from Singapore, from Asia   …    ” How about Europe? They’ve got plenty there. In his Telegraph column today, Boris Johnson declared that David Cameron needs a plan to stop this political Diana moment. That’s a bit like the drunk chauffeur and 15 French paparazzi demanding to know why the Queen is still at Balmoral. But Farage has got a plan, he wanted us to know, which amounts to: let’s get the hell on with it. Though he was needily coy as to a potential role for himself in the political negotiations. “We need a team of negotiators that includes figures from across the political spectrum,” he kept stressing, “which reflects where that Brexit vote came from. ” Which was, in case you missed it, from “the Ukip people’s army” and “Ukip’s messages”. It is fair to say Nigel remains unaware of the difference in calibre between himself and a figure such as Theresa May (whatever your views on her). You sense he will be condemned to wonder furiously why the call to the top table doesn’t come, much as Liz Hurley may enquire furiously of her agent why she has been overlooked again for a role in favour of Meryl Streep. Keen to get a clearer sense of the Farage diplomacy doctrine, I asked him: does he think the tone he took in the European parliament last week was a good negotiating tactic that will help the UK to get the best deal out of Europe? After all, for an MEP who must have spent a lot of time near airport bookshops over the past two decades, Nigel seems mystified by the tenets of even basic business manuals. Unless I missed the bit in Sun Tzu that explains that all battles are won by mugging off your opponents before you start. Explaining the “context” of his artless and embarrassing rudeness, Nigel claimed that the session had been “the worst event ever in the history of the European project”. It was only right, he went on, “that they got just a tiny little piece of my mind”. That is certainly all he would have to spare. His failure to understand how avenues are being opened up for any future deal appears total. Any manoeuvrability is deemed “backsliding”. “If we start to concede in these negotiations now,” he explained, “we will get a rotten deal. We’ve got the trump cards. ” Certainly the Trump cards. Perhaps he could use his new free time to pen Nigel Farage’s Art of the Deal. Either way, according to Nigel, we are now going to see “the real me” now he is no longer constrained by   …     by what? Decorum? Ukip’s famously rigorous party discipline?   race discrimination legislation? It was rather unclear. Of all the Farage disguises, incidentally, Daffy Nigel is the least convincing. Was he going to get a seat in the Lords? “Oh gosh, I shouldn’t have thought so for a moment. ” The main thing about his victory, he reminded listeners for the 2, 345th time, was that “we were against the entire UK establishment”. Spoken like a man who had literally spent yesterday at a garden party at the home of newspaper proprietor Evgeny Lebedev, sitting opposite Liam Fox and Rupert Murdoch. Considering how frequently he warned people to “watch this space” if Ukip doesn’t get the deal it wants out of Brexit, you should probably treat reports of Mr Farage’s departure as somewhat exaggerated. For my tastes, the entire event recalled the moment in the Day Today soap opera set in a bureau de change, when the Steve Coogan boss declares dramatically: “I never thought I’d say this, but pull down the blinds. I’M CLOSING THE BUREAU   …     for an hour. ”

Georgia police officer killed by suspect who remains on the run, officials say
Authorities say a police officer in a small, central Georgia city has been shot and killed by a suspect who remains on the loose. Special agent Scott Whitley of the Georgia bureau of investigation told the Associated Press that Eastman patrol officer Tim Smith, 31, was fatally shot at about 9. 30pm Saturday in a residential area of the city about 60 miles   of Macon.  “Officer Smith exited his patrol car to investigate and was shot by the individual,” the Georgia bureau of investigation said in a statement.  Whitley said Smith was responding to a suspicious person call when he encountered the suspect, exited his patrol car and was shot. The suspect fled the scene.  Whitley said Smith was in his early 30s but no further information about him was immediately available. He said an unidentified suspect was being sought and an investigation was ongoing.  Smith was not wearing a body camera. The Georgia bureau of investigation is seeking tips to identify and find the assailant, it said. It did not release information about a possible motive for the attack.

Chaos, caution and fairytales – is Euro 2016 about to catch fire?
For much of its first fortnight Euro 2016 felt like a party that, for completely understandable reasons, the hosts did not much want to hold. As though hovering behind their guests with a dustpan and brush, repeatedly checking the clock to see when it would be polite to ask them to leave and turning the music down whenever possible, organisers have had the air of reluctant hosts. It was only with the final round of group games, two weeks in, that there were signs this tournament is ready to throw off its shackles. That is not to say the French public and the omnipresent youthful volunteers in jaunty cagoules that are now routinely roped in to any major international sporting event to brighten it up for minimal pay have not been welcoming. Simply that they appear to have had their minds on other matters, from the security situation to national strikes and the looming EU referendum on the other side of the Channel. Uefa, meanwhile, was locked in internal meltdown until the eve of the tournament, mourning the defenestration of their leader Michel Platini following his rapid fall from grace and waving goodbye to its general secretary, Gianni Infantino, as he swapped Nyon for the Fifa headquarters in Zurich. It is as though as soon as terrorists struck venues across Paris on 13 November last year, the wider security threat obscured all else. Although the big pieces of the puzzle were in place  —   impressive stadiums built or refurbished, tickets sold  —   the final stages of the organisation therefore became frayed. So while all the usual accoutrements are there  —   the sponsors’ branding, the     entertainment  —   there has been a vaguely chaotic feel at its heart. Such as, for example, ensuring pitches were fit to play on. The surface at the Stade Pierre Mauroy in Lille, in particular, has been appalling and necessitated an emergency diktat from Uefa requiring it to be replaced by a new one flown in from the Netherlands after the last group match there between Italy and the Republic of Ireland. It is a small detail, but it highlights a wider undercurrent of niggly concerns that have steadfastly dogged efforts to get the party started. The level of organisation in the stadiums has also felt worryingly lax at times for a country under a state of emergency. Even after Uefa admitted the scenes in the Stade Vélodrome on the opening weekend, where Russian supporters charged at their fleeing English counterparts, left huge questions to answer over stewarding and ticketing there have been further instances of flares being smuggled into stadiums and disorder among fans. Even some of those sides for whom international tournament football is a novelty have been shocked. Supporters travelling with Iceland, for example, are known to have been concerned about a lack of segregation in stadiums and glitches involving ticketing and logistics. Then there was the incident where a fan was allowed to run the length of the Parc des Princes pitch to demand a selfie with Ronaldo. Something more sinister has also stirred. The expansion of the tournament to 24 teams seems to have both increased the possibility of     moments of international bonding and, conversely, provided a backdrop for the tensions currently playing out across the continent. Outside the stadiums this ragged atmosphere has manifested itself in all sorts of ways  —   from the edgy riot police in Marseille and Lille, to the lack of any sort of concession to a major sporting event being held on the streets of the capital. In the small merchandising outlets erected in major train stations, piles of official souvenirs so far remain untouched. Things may change as the tournament progresses especially if the French team, already mildly discombobulated by a needless   with the media over Paul Pogba, clicks into gear. History shows that at the 1998 World Cup the population swung behind the team and the tournament only as it reached the business end. The format and the football have not helped. To what extent the former begat the latter will continue to be debated and may become a moot point if the tournament takes flight in the knockout stages. The group stage, however, has yielded the lowest average goals per game figure (1. 92) since 1992 and delivered few truly memorable matches. As many predicted, the thrill of the qualifying stages in delivering new sides to the top table has not been matched by the feast itself, with a fortnight and 36 matches devoted to getting rid of only a third of those in the competition. As was the case with the   World Cup the format is cumbersome and flies in the face of natural justice, with some sides knowing exactly what they needed to do to go through and others flying blind. While in Brazil two years ago an outbreak of adventurous attacking football featuring a fresh batch of stars helped to paper over some of the organisational cracks, in France some of the action on the pitch has been as drab as the weather as the bigger nations have tried to keep their powder dry for the knockout stages  —   and in one or two cases come unstuck. It also seems inevitable that those opening troubling days in Marseille will leave a huge stain. At some distance it now seems clear that the antisocial and boorish behaviour of some England fans over three days should not be conflated with the organised violence that followed from a   gang of Russian hooligans. Yet nor should that excuse or lead us to gloss over that behaviour. Most depressingly, it appears to have begat a new generation of England fans who believe that aggressive occupation of host cities is the way to follow their team. As for Russia, the overlaps between   politics, organised hooliganism, its official travelling supporters’ club and the Kremlin are too troubling to ignore before the 2018 World Cup tournament. Somewhere in that toxic brew is a troubling portent of what is to come. And yet there has, of course, been a flipside. The adrenaline rush of international matches coming thick and fast has helped to hide some of the problems. There have been some stunning goals and some players that have suggested they can take the competition by the scruff of the neck, not least Dimitri Payet and Gareth Bale. The sheer volume of football can be intoxicating and the atmosphere inside stadiums has generally been good. The Russians have gone home, hopefully taking the worst excesses of a minority of their fanbase with them. Away from the sodden north, the Northern Ireland and Wales fans have been having a ball. In Paris, Republic of Ireland supporters have made friends and provided some cheer with their relentless acts of random kindness. Noisy and passionate fans from Iceland, Slovakia and elsewhere have joined the party. A French barkeeper was quoted in L’Équipe as saying that the Irish fans from north and south had given Parisians something to smile about after a relentlessly grim seven months. The sentiment was heartfelt, though no doubt the influx had been good for takings too. With the distressing and troubling events of Marseille and Lille behind them, the vast majority of England fans were able to at least go some way to redressing the balance by delivering what Martin Glenn, the Football Association chief executive, called the best atmosphere he had witnessed at an England game in  . Adrian Tempany noted in his excellent recent book, And the Sun Shines Now, that Euro 96 was the first football tournament of the   media age, with   fans playing up to the cameras and watching themselves on the big screens. Social media and the ubiquity of camera phones has taken this to another level  —   from harmless, inclusive mass singalongs to the deeply disturbing footage of the trouble in Marseille. This is fandom as performance. As the final round of a group matches drew to a close amid a flurry of mathematical calculations and frantic logistical arrangements for fans, the weather took a turn for the better. Iceland and Northern Ireland continued their fairytales, the former with a   winner that provoked delirium. Portugal and Hungary played out a   freewheeling   draw and the Republic of Ireland secured a   winner (late goals being another feature of this tournament) to send their fans wild in Lille. By some fluke, Uefa has ended up with a delicious twin narrative  —   meaningful, heavyweight knockout clashes in one half of the draw with new names and stories in the other. Ultimately, it comes back to the football. Anticipating some of the   matches to come and the propensity of the French to get behind their team once they start to build some momentum, the sun may be about to come out on Euro 2016 too.

Russian government hackers steal DNC files on Donald Trump
Hackers linked to the Russian government stole research files on Donald Trump from the Democratic National Committee, according to a US firm investigating the breach. Some of the hackers had been lurking in the systems since at least last summer, well before Trump sealed the Republican nomination, but only recently exfiltrated the Democratic party’s cache of files on Trump’s business dealings and past political statements, investigators said.  Political parties normally use such files for attack ads and leaking story ideas to journalists while spy agencies typically maintain dossiers on world leaders to better understand their thinking and habits. The Washington Post previously reported on the breach on Tuesday. “Everyone around the world is trying to figure out, ‘Who is Mr Trump? ’” said Dmitri Alperovitch, chief technology officer of Crowdstrike, the cybersecurity firm the DNC hired to investigate the breach. “What is his foreign policy going to be? What is it going to be in relation to Russia? He’s said some complimentary things about Putin. How real is that?” Crowdstrike said it actually found two different hacking groups going after the Trump files. The company believes the hackers that got in last summer might be linked to Russia’s federal security service, known as FSB, while another team that got into the system in April are probably linked to Russian military intelligence.  Crowdstrike spent the weekend removing the hackers from the party’s computers. Neither the Russian embassy nor the DNC responded immediately to a request for comment. Following   data breaches, companies such as Crowdstrike act as part IT guy, part private intelligence service. The victims hire them to clean up the mess and get computers working again. But they also try to figure out who was behind the hack.  Crowdstrike, staffed by people who have either worked for or close to the US government, has a particular specialty in tracking what many believe are hacking teams for the Russian and Chinese governments. However, making such determinations from the US is often a mix of forensic evidence, government sources and unprovable hunches. Some of the hackers found inside the DNC’s machines have previously been linked to espionage campaigns against Nato and Germany’s Bundestag. Foreign cyberspies have a long history of targeting America’s political campaigns. China, for instance, was accused of hacking Barack Obama’s and John McCain’s presidential campaigns during the 2008 US election. US spies regularly target national party systems in China, Russia and other countries.  But in this case, it’s not clear the DNC would have too much of an issue with people stealing its Trump files. Parties ostensibly gather and maintain opposition research for the purpose of spreading negative stories. Crowdstrike’s Alperovitch said there was no evidence of any other data being taken from the party.  It’s less clear what Trump will make of the breach. In the past he has boasted that President Vladimir Putin of Russia has called him “bright and talented”. Trump has also praised Putin as a “strong leader. He’s a powerful leader. ” The presumptive GOP nominee had not posted on Twitter about the breach as of Tuesday afternoon.  But it certainly adds another surreal element to an already bizarre election.  When reporters asked Senator Lindsey Graham, who briefly ran against Trump in the GOP primary this year, about the incident, he responded with: “Are you making that shit up?”

New York monument honors victims of giant octopus attack that never occurred
A   monument for the victims of the sinking of a steam ferry recently appeared in Battery Park at the southern tip of Manhattan, near other somber memorials to soldiers, sailors and mariners lost at sea or on the battlefield. There was, however, no such ferry disaster. The artist behind the memorial, Joseph Reginella, made the whole thing up. The 250lb monument, which depicts a Staten Island ferry, the Cornelius G Kolff, being dragged under the waves by a giant octopus, is part of a   hoax that includes a sophisticated website, a documentary, fabricated newspaper articles and glossy fliers directing tourists to a phantom Staten Island Ferry Disaster Memorial Museum, across the harbor. The project took six months to build. Reginella said the idea came to him while he was taking his    nephew from Florida on the ferry between Manhattan and Staten Island. “He was asking me all kinds of crazy questions, like if the waters were ” he said. “I said ‘No, but you know what did happen in the 60s? One of these boats got pulled down by a giant octopus. ” “The story just rolled off the top of my head,” he said, and it evolved to become “a multimedia art project and social experience  —   not maliciously  —   about how gullible people are”. Reginella, who usually creates artworks for store windows and amusement parks, said his ferry monument never stayed in one spot for more than two days “because the city will come and take it away”. It takes two people to break the piece down and move it. “It’s definitely an experience when you see people who don’t know about it,” Reginella said. “They get this strange look on their face, they stare out at the water and walk away. I sit close by with a fishing pole and fish. I eavesdrop on the conversations. ” Sometimes, he said, when he overhears people saying, “How come nobody has ever heard of this?” he’ll interject, offering that the disaster happened on 22 November 1963, a day when the news was dominated by the assassination of President John F Kennedy. “It creates a plausibility for them,” he said, “and they shake their head, ‘Maybe. ’” Puzzled tourists looking for the memorial museum on Staten Island and its supposed collection of wreckage with “strange    marks” sometimes wander into the Snug Harbor Cultural Center, asking for directions. Staff at the nearby Staten Island Museum admit they too were puzzled at first. “We kind of scratched our heads and said we don’t know where it is and started looking further into it, and realized it was a hoax,” said a spokeswoman, Rachel Somma. “Most people have the feeling that it’s not a reality. It’s a treasure hunt for them. It’s fun. That’s what we love about it . .. It’s great that it gets people out here. ” Melanie Giuliano, who produced a mock documentary for Reginella’s website, used her father in the role of a maritime expert and a neighbor as an eyewitness. A colleague of Reginella’s wife served as the narrator. “I thought it was an insane idea but I thought it was hilarious,” said Giuliano. One thing about the preposterous story is real. There really was a Cornelius G Kolff ferry, which carried passengers for 36 years before becoming a floating dorm for inmates at the Rikers Island prison. It was sold for scrap in 2003.

The Lady Chablis, transgender nightclub star, dies aged 59
The Lady Chablis, the transgender nightclub star from Savannah, Georgia, who successfully lobbied Clint Eastwood to play herself in his 1997 adaptation of the John Berendt novel Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, has reportedly passed away at the age of 59. Chablis, who told Entertainment Tonight in 1996 that she changed her legal name to reflect her   stage name (including the “The”) was a drag star who also lived publicly as a woman. Her unforgettable turn in the 1997 movie, which marked the first time that a mainstream American film featured a transgender actor portraying a transgender woman (and did so without pathologizing her or making her a subject of ridicule) led to both ups and downs, as she told Savannah reporter Linda Sickler before one of her annual birthday shows at Club One. “I got to meet certain people, I got to work as a model, I opened at the Kennedy Center and headlined a jazz tour. I got to write a bestselling book and be in a movie,” Chablis said, while admitting: “Also, it put me in the limelight where I had to wear that label ‘drag queen’. I’ve never been comfortable with that label. “That sort of brought me out of the closet,” she added. “I had to come to terms with that. ” Chablis, who in the movie is portrayed receiving hormone shots, called her 1996 autobiography Hiding My Candy in reference to the fact that she had not had sexual reassignment surgery, and often joked about her status in her act. But when she came to prominence in the 90s, before terms like transgender had come to the fore and the spectrum of transitions was less widely understood or accepted, she was alternately referred to, even by friends like the author Berendt, as a “a   transvestite” or “a preoperative transsexual” and her fame left her less able to “pass” and more subject to harassment.  “Not everyone is into The Lady Chablis,” she told Sickler. As a result of the publicity from the movie, Chablis left her longtime home in Savannah for West Columbia, South Carolina  —   though she continued to perform regularly at Club One, where she had been their inaugural performer. The Club memorialized her on their Facebook page, noting that she had long donated proceeds from her show to diabetes and LGBT causes. Berendt, too, issued a statement in which he said that Chablis was the character about whom he was most often still asked. “Chablis could be playful and ironic, but she had a tough inner core,” he wrote. “‘Don’t be fooled by this dress I’m wearing,’ she’d say with a hint of danger in her voice. ” Her most recent national media appearance was on an episode of the Real Housewives of Atlanta in 2013, when cast members went to Club One to catch her show and NeNe Leakes asked Chablis to teach cast member Mynique Smith to both read and throw shade. On social media, fans memorialized her with a shortened version  —   “two tears in a bucket”  —   of one of her most famous lines from the movie: “It’s like my mom always said: ‘Two tears in a bucket, motherfuck it,’”  —   a   of the classic and sadly   idiom that there’s no use crying over spilt milk.

After Orlando terror, time for Mexican fans to dump ’puto’ once and for all
Anyone with a passing acquaintance with football in South and Central America knew it was coming. The Venezuela keeper Dani Hernandez prepared to take a goal kick during his side’s Copa América match against Mexico, and down came the chant from the terraces: “Ehhhhhh, puto”. The phrase roughly translates as “fag” and its homophobia is unedifying in any context. But on Monday night, the chant had added sting, coming just days after the terrible attack on the LGBT community in Orlando, where 49 people were killed at a gay nightclub. The effect was all the more jarring after a minute’s silence had been held in the stadium for the victims of the tragedy. While the chant’s implications and historical meaning continue to be a hot debate among Mexican fans and football pundits  —   puto is also a general insult, but in the context of a football game the word is undoubtedly used as a homophobic slur  —   refraining from the chant could have relayed a powerful message after a tragedy whose victims included four Mexican citizens. Mexican Americans have been showing up in huge numbers to this month’s Copa América, and their team  —   unbeaten in 22 games  —   are justifiably one of the tournament favorites. More than 80, 000 fans attended when El Tri faced Jamaica at the Rose Bowl last week, and there is a sense of   advantage every time Mexico enters from the tunnel. This, however, hasn’t stopped a lack of empathy from thousands of fans, who still carelessly used puto at a time when the country looks to stand together with citizens from the gay and Latino communities. From a fan perspective, it is true that football is a place where industrial language and playful repartee can freely exist. It is also true that puto can also mean a coward or a fool. But in this context, it clearly intends to offend in a homophobic way. Similar arguments are made by fans of English football, such as the antisemitic “Yid Army” chants directed at Spurs fans, but we have moved on as a society, and vulgarity should never excuse ignorance. There have been campaigns to stop the puto chant, which is not limited to Mexico. Before the tournament began, Mexico’s soccer federation  —   in collaboration with the national team  —   launched the campaign “Ya párale” (another traditional Mexican phrase meaning “Stop now”) which aimed to put an end to the chant. But so far, it has not worked: it is still heard at every game. Fifa fined Mexico last year as a result of the same actions by their fans during a Concacaf qualifying match against El Salvador. Peru, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile were also fined over similar incidents. The truth is that the issue, much like racism, runs far deeper than fines or bans. It lives far beyond the gates of football stadiums and requires practical and educational solutions from the federation, aimed at reaching communities at grassroots level. This is a tough task, which will require money, time, and, most importantly, collective effort. A video will not be enough. Before defending the sanctity and cultural importance of the chant, fans could perhaps ask themselves: “What if we didn’t say it? What if we stopped the chant?” The answer is simple. Your team’s performance will not suffer, you will still  —   hopefully  —   play beautiful soccer, you would still be proud of them. But more importantly, you will send a message of unity to a community who desperately need it right now.

The Spurs’ season was not supposed to end this way. What does the future hold?
This wasn’t how this postseason was supposed to go. For the past few months it has been an article of faith that the Western Conference would come down to the San Antonio Spurs and the Golden State Warriors. Throughout the regular season, the two teams looked like they were playing on a completely different level then the rest of the league. That’s why it was downright jarring to see the Thunder thoroughly dismantle the Spurs last night in Game 6. With their   victory, Oklahoma City clinched a trip to the Western Conference finals. The Spurs, their season having come to an abrupt end, now have to turn their attention to towards their uncertain future earlier than they had hoped. The Spurs were favored to win this series for a very good reason. San Antonio came into the postseason having won 67 games, a franchise record. In the first round of the playoffs they completely demolished the Memphis Grizzlies in a   sweep. Plus, they had home court advantage in the series against the Thunder, although it didn’t look like they would end up needing it after they beat the Thunder   in Game 1. By this point, uncertainty around Stephen Curry’s health and availability led to the Spurs becoming the favorites to win the NBA finals. Instead, San Antonio ended up winning just one more game after that. Even though the Spurs only lost once at home during the regular season, and that to the   Warriors, the Thunder found a way to beat the Spurs at ATT Center twice in the span of four games. On the brink of elimination, San Antonio played Game 6 with uncharacteristic desperation. As Spurs player after Spurs player tried and failed to get into an sort of offensive rhythm, Gregg Popovich, almost universally regarded as the best head coach in the NBA, kept making increasingly inexplicable substitutions as if hoping to stumble upon a combination that would work. He did not. By   the Spurs had scored just 31 points, a   and the Thunder were clearly in command. To their credit, the Spurs didn’t relent. In fact, there was a moment in the fourth quarter where it looked like the team had at least one more miracle comeback left in them. During this manic final run, the Spurs cut the Thunder lead, which was once as large as 28 points, to 11. Thunder fans, loud and boisterous for most of the game, became increasingly quiet, all too familiar with the signs of a potential late game collapse. Then the Spurs run came to a sudden, shocking end when Serge Ibaka blocked a Duncan   one he probably would have made just a few years ago. With that one swat, it was as if all the tension in the building was released at once. San Antonio never really threatened again. If you weren’t a Thunder fan, Duncan’s failed   might have brought on an unexpected rush of sadness. It’s always a difficult to watch the greats face their basketball immortality, but, as our DJ Gallo noted, it’s downright shocking when the player in question is Duncan, who staved off   decline for such a long time that it’s become his primary characteristic. In fact, for well over a decade, the Spurs’ identity has been tied to this concept that they’re the only constant in the   basketball world. Every year, the Spurs would be in the playoffs. Duncan, Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker would be three of the most important players on the court. That era is coming to an end. Duncan and Ginobili have player options for next season and could choose to retire. Even if they decide to return, it will be to serve as role players.  Don’t think of this as a eulogy, however. The Spurs are not going into rebuilding mode. While the Spurs might finally have reached the end of one era, the next one has already begun. With Kawhi Leonard, who placed second in this year’s MVP voting, they have maybe the most dangerous   player in the league. While LaMarcus Aldridge seemed to be like a luxury item when the Spurs signed him during the offseason, it looks like he’ll be a crucial part of the next version of the Spurs. Popovich will be head coach for however long he wants to continue in that role. Unless something goes terrible awry, they should be an attractive to free agents for the foreseeable future simply because their track record of success.  But, still, even if last night didn’t mark the end of the Spurs as one of the premier teams in the league, it certainly felt like the end of something. Something very real, if not entirely explicable. For an entire generation of NBA fans, Duncan, Ginobili and Parker are the Spurs and have always been the Spurs. What could this team possibly look like without them?

China unveils J-20 stealth jet fighter in show of military might
China showed its Chengdu   stealth fighter in public for the first time on Tuesday, opening the country’s biggest meeting of aircraft makers and buyers with a show of its military clout. Two   jets, Zhuhai’s headline act, swept over dignitaries and hundreds of spectators and industry executives gathered at the show’s opening ceremony in a   flypast, generating a deafening roar that was met with gasps and applause and set off car alarms in a car park at the site. Airshow China, in the southern city of Zhuhai, offers Beijing an opportunity to demonstrate its ambitions in civil aerospace and to underline its defence ambitions. China is set to overtake the US as the world’s top aviation market in the next decade. Bradley Perrett of Aviation Week, a veteran China watcher, said: “It is clearly a big step forward in Chinese combat capability. ”  Analysts say it is too early to say to what extent the new Chinese fighter can match the   properties of the Lockheed Martin   Raptor    combat jet  —   developed for the US Air Force and the  ’s closest lookalike  —   or the latest strike jet in the US arsenal, Lockheed’s  .  Unofficial shots of a   prototype fuelled discussion about the region’s power balance when first glimpsed by planespotters in 2010. Experts say China has been refining designs in the hope of narrowing a military gap with Washington.  Cao Qingfeng, an aircraft engineer watching the flypast, said the “stunning” display was a show of China’s strengthening aircraft industry and manufacturing  —   and western officials agreed.  “This shows they now have confidence to put it out in public,” said a western industry official who has monitored the biennial show from its inception 20 years ago.  “This is the airplane for China in the way that the   is not this is the one they develop for themselves,” he added.  The     was unveiled at Zhuhai in 2014. President Xi Jinping has pushed to toughen the armed forces as China takes a more assertive stance in the region, particularly in the South China and East China seas.  It remains unclear whether or how the   would be displayed after the flypast, or to what extent foreign executives and media would be allowed a close look as they try to figure out its role and effectiveness. Some foreign observers have questioned its stealth capabilities.  Aircraft that are already scheduled to be on display alongside the latest Chinese weapon systems, radar and drones include the Xian   strategic airlifter, and what organisers say is the largest amphibious plane now in production, the AG600.  The flying boat is officially promoted as a   or search and rescue plane. But analysts note the AG600  —   first unveiled 10 days after a Hague tribunal ruled against China’s claim to parts of the South China Sea in July  —   is well suited to resupplying military outposts in the disputed area.  Notably absent from the airshow schedule is the Comac C919 passenger jet, designed to compete with Airbus and Boeing, the rivals which dominate the global supply of airliners.  The   C919 is scheduled to stage an   maiden flight this year, but industry sources say this will now slip to 2017  —   three years behind original plans.  Airbus and Boeing continue to expand in China with recent plant announcements. Boeing is expected to announce a new supplier partnership at the show, which runs until 6 November.

’I wanted to be Willy Wonka’: how Gene Wilder inspired future pastry chefs
The birth of Willy Wonka predated Gene Wilder’s embodiment of him by seven years. Dahl’s book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory first appeared in 1964 Mel Stuart’s retitled adaptation came in 1971. But with Wilder’s passing last week, the world also mourned the passing of the man synonymous with that of the mercurial candy man. Widely seen and deeply felt, Wilder’s portrayal of the man behind the world’s strangest chocolate factory resonated with children everywhere  —   but also in the hearts and minds of inchoate pastry chefs who were inspired by the edible teacup and everlasting gobstopper. Rarely mentioned as a food movie, per se, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory inspired generations to enter into a world of pure imagination. Pastry chef, Le Coucou, New York, As a kid, you’re supposed to identify with Charlie Bucket but I grew up wanting to be Willy Wonka. Now, as someone who works in the kitchen, I recognize Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory as the ultimate food movie. It has everything we deal with in our professional lives: disputes with labor, doing paper work in a cramped office, mass production in a factory setting, recipe development, innovation and technology. There’s cleaning and maintenance after Augustus Gloop contaminates the chocolate river.   But as a kid, it gave me permission to think that maybe it’s not so bad to cloister yourself away, as Wonka did, to create fantastical magical creations. As pastry chefs, I like to say we’re back of back of house. But we know what we do will reach the right hands.  Chocolate maker, Jacques Torres, As a Frenchman, I didn’t grow up with this movie. I saw it only when I came to America in my thirties. But Wilder did have a big influence on every professional because he transformed his profession into a dream. He conveyed a fantasy of the profession. That’s his legacy. Though I didn’t see it until I was grown up, he still taught me that the world of chocolate is very much like a dream. It doesn’t have to be that serious.  I once met Wilder one day on the plane going to Europe. I said, “My name is Jacques Torres, I’m Mr Chocolate. ” He was very kind. Pastry chef, Gotham Bar and Grill, New York, I was a huge Gene Wilder fan from Silver Streak, Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I saw it a few years after it came out, probably when I was six or seven years old. It has meant more to me as I’ve grown older. Especially when I started my professional life. It’s a sort of permission to find fantasy in food, especially sweets. He taught us to keep everything whimsical and innocent and honest. And yet, there was an undercurrent of complexity. Take, for example, the everlasting gobstopper to the three course dinner chewing gum. Something that appeared very neutral was so complex. Carrying that theme into desserts, as pastry chefs we want to create a dessert that is not only memorable but also with a twist. Doing a classic with a modern twist  —   like our Black Forest dessert we’re running now  —   is certainly a legacy of Wonka. He was the early culinary pioneer if you will.  Chef and owner Empellon, New York, The scene that stands out to me and is my favorite in the movie is when Gene Wilder is singing and he stops for a minute and he picks up this little teacup flower. It’s a butter cup. He takes a sip out of it and then he eats the cup. I watched that movie when I was young and I had no idea what surrealism was. But that idea  —   that things don’t need to be what they seem  —   always stuck with me. Before elBulli’s Ferran Adrià or Heston Blumenthal, it was in that film. What Wonka did with simple concepts of reversalism and the manipulation of expectation, is exactly what those (and so many other) chefs are chasing today. The other aspect was that though Wonka dealt in fantasy and pleasure for children and adults alike, Wilder injected a healthy dose of dark sarcasm. It alludes to something in general in the food industry that usually the person trying to make everyone happy could be a little crazy. They’re definitely driven by ego and there’s a ton of hard work that goes on behind the scenes. Chef and owner,   New York, I’ve seen Willy Wonka many, many times in my youth and as recently as last week. My kids love it, especially my younger daughter who is about to turn four. Willy Wonka has always inspired me, especially in terms of my approach to cooking. The encouragement to play with your food has always rung true for me.  I love the concept of compound flavors which Wonka embodied in a chewing gum that contained an entire a Thanksgiving meal all the way to desert. You can see that influence in things like Grant Achatz   postage   pizza. But more generally, any time someone tells you you can think freely or encourages you to experiment, to think creatively, to have fun, to be playful, we can thank Mr Wilder as well as people like myself for legitimate ideas and inspiration. Executive pastry chef, The Publican, Chicago, To me Willy Wonka was the fairy princess story. There’s a storyline that’s fed to girls, that a normal girl that she’s actually a princess and discovers this royal world waiting for me. Willy Wonka was that story to me. I wanted to discover I was actually an heir to the candy throne. What fascinated me as a kid was the idea of candy being more than something you ate but being, rather, an engulfing experience. I don’t know if I ever licked the walls of my room, but I remember I dreamed about it and I remember begging my mother to let me have a Willy Wonka birthday party. We were going to transform my basement into the Pure Imagination room. It never came to fruition. I grew up north of Seattle. We didn’t have a lot of money growing up so I related quite a bit to Charlie. I used to hate watching that song Cheer up, Charlie. They had to eat lettuce soup which, I thought, meant they must have been the poorest of the poor. That stuck with me: the fear of lettuce soup. Now I’ve been at Michelin three star restaurants and have been served lettuce soup. Everyone thought, “Oooh, avant garde. ” But I realized it was triggering an actual fear of becoming that poor. One lasting effect of Wonka on my work is embodied in the that edible teacup. Wonka picks it up, drinks the nectar and the the cup itself becomes a piece of candy. It’s  : you think it’s one thing, it looks like something else and it’s actually a third. Those elements of wonder and   are something that I still strive for. We just put a cookie jar on the menu at the Publican. I went and collected cookie jars I loved, you can order cookies for the table, you can open it and their eyes just light up, you’re like a kid again. Former pastry chef, Noma and The Fat Duck chef and   Luksus in New York City, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was pretty crucial to my childhood. I vividly remember the circus of sweets, the opulence of the factory’s rooms. When I was working at The Fat Duck, we were very inspired by Roald Dahl, whose writing studio was just minutes from Bray, the small town in which the restaurant is located. Many of [pastry chef] Jocky Petrie’s desserts were inspired by Dahl’s work from Mrs Marshall’s Margaret coronet, a   cone of Lilliputian proportion, to the BFG, a Black Forest Gateau that could just as easily been called the Big Friendly Giant.

Manchester United in chase for £84m Paul Pogba but Real Madrid lead race
Paul Pogba will join Manchester United only if his first choice of Real Madrid proves impossible, with José Mourinho’s hopes of securing the France midfielder resting on outbidding the Spanish club and meeting the player’s wage demand of €300, 000 (£250, 000) a week. United and Real both want Pogba, though Juventus do not want to lose the Frenchman, who scored in his country’s   Euro 2016   defeat of Iceland on Sunday. This means the clubs would have to match Juventus’s minimum €100m (£84m) valuation in the first instance, and there would then be a bidding war. If United were to offer a higher fee than Real and have this accepted, Mourinho would next have to mount the hurdle of Pogba preferring to play for the European champions rather than for United. The Portuguese would hope agreeing to Pogba’s salary expectations could do this and the influence of the player’s agent, Mino Raiola, may also be a telling factor. Raiola brokered the deal for Mourinho to sign Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is also a client, on a free transfer. He is also set to seal the transfer of Borussia Dortmund’s Henrikh Mkhitaryan, another whom the Dutchman represents, to United. Mourinho and United hope this relationship can help make a return to the club for Pogba possible. Raiola, it is understood, believes Pogba may be better suited by a return to United rather than a move to Real. When Pogba left Old Trafford in 2012 Raiola played a key role. Sir Alex Ferguson was then the manager and he later blamed Raiola for United losing Pogba. Last year, in his book Leading, Ferguson wrote: “There are one or two football agents I simply do not like and Mino Raiola, Paul Pogba’s agent, is one of them. I distrusted him from the moment I met him. We had Paul under a   contract, and it had a   renewal option which we were eager to sign. But Raiola suddenly appeared on the scene and our first meeting was a fiasco. “He and I were like oil and water. From then on our goose was cooked because Raiola had been able to ingratiate himself with Paul and his family and the player signed with Juventus. ” Mourinho officially began working at United on Monday in advance of his official unveiling at the club on Tuesday. On Wednesday the former Chelsea manager will meet some of his players for the first time when those not involved in Euro 2016 or the Copa América return for tests before  . These include Juan Mata, Phil Jones, Memphis Depay, Adnan Januzaj, Daley Blind and James Wilson. Ryan Giggs will not be there for the first time in 29 years after leaving to pursue a career as a manager elsewhere. Ferguson backed the decision. “It is time Ryan stood on his own feet, got out there and accepted the challenge,” he told the BBC. “I talk about his poker face. He has a bit of steel about him. It is such a highly intense results industry you need people who go into it to have a bit of steel about them, a bit of character and personality. ”

Tennessee mother calls for removal of school history book ’promoting Islamic propaganda’
A Tenessee mother and founding member of a parents’ group opposed to Islamic “indoctrination” has asked for a history textbook to be removed from her daughter’s social studies curriculum, claiming that it “promotes Islamic propaganda”. Michelle Edmisten, a founder of the Facebook group Sullivan County Parents Against Islam Indoctrination, first raised the issue in October, after her daughter was given an assignment requiring her to answer questions about the name of Islam’s holy book, and the five pillars of Islam.  Edmisten told the board of education that her child “felt some of the assignments went against her beliefs as a Christian” according to WJHL. com, and called for the textbook  —   My World History, published by   Pearson  —   to be “yanked from the school immediately”. “I would like to see parents, Christians, veterans, anyone that’s anyone, stand up for this fight. How can I, as a Christian, say that I have these values?” she said at the time. According to a report from local paper Times News, she was applauded as she called for the book to be removed, and for those present to “take back our families, schools and our country”. Edmisten has now filed a formal complaint to the school district, claiming the textbook “promotes Islamic propaganda”. “It gives false claims and views on Islam, trying to ‘normalise’ [it] through our children,” she wrote. According to the National Coalition Against Censorship (NCAC) Sullivan County policy gives the school’s headteacher 15 days to convene a review committee to “determine the extent to which the [challenged] material supports the curriculum” and recommend a way forward to the head. The NCAC, which is preparing a letter of protest should the textbook be pulled from the curriculum, pointed out that the Facebook group had “shared articles with titles such as, ‘Top 10 reasons why Islam is NOT the religion of peace’ has labelled the Pearson board of directors ‘globalists’ and has asked its followers to ‘speak to your churches’. ” The NCAC said the controversy “sadly reflects larger efforts to purge lessons on Islam from schools in Tennessee” with a proposed new curriculum retaining lessons on religions including Christianity, Buddhism and Hinduism, but removing information “on the history and spread of Islam, the life and teachings of Muhammad, and the study of Islamic art”. In Williamson county in October 2015, the school board filed a resolution that was later withdrawn, saying “parents and taxpayers have expressed concerns that some   textbooks and supplemental materials in use in Tennessee classrooms contain a      bias” while in White County, a group called Citizens Against Islamic Indoctrination placed an ad in the local paper with the   text: “ISLAMIC INDOCTRINATION IS IN SCHOOLS ACROSS OUR STATE AND OUR NATION”. “It’s still part of history,” Susan Lodal, the Tennessee board of education’s vice president, told Times News in September. “We’re just not teaching it to our children. ”  The Sullivan County board of education chairman, Michael Hughes, said that concerned parents were “in favour of just [taking it out of the standards]. I don’t believe they want it taught at all. ” A spokesman for the publisher Pearson told the Guardian that their “materials are created to meet the academic guidelines set by individual states. ” “In September and October of 2015 Pearson representatives made two separate trips to Tennessee to meet with parents, advocacy groups and policymakers to address their specific questions about the depiction of religion in textbooks. During these meetings, we welcomed their feedback, answered their questions in full and were clear that we are always willing to look into concerns about textbook content,” he continued. “We continue to be committed to presenting balanced, unbiased, and accurate material. In addition, our offer stands to answer questions directly from concerned groups in Tennessee. ”

What I’m really thinking: the recovered anorexic
When I ask if I can meet you at this particular cafe or that specific restaurant, I am only trying to be polite I’m not posing a question. It is an offer to go to a place I have meticulously researched and probably visited before. Spontaneity is a word that will never be associated with my character. I consider myself “recovered” but I do not like the term. I suffered from a mental illness for about four years, gripped in a stranglehold of control, starvation and numbers. I am now at a point where I manage my disease. There will be days when restrictive impulses fail to intrude my thoughts, but there will be times when they resurface. I try hard to fight against them. Check myself. Breathe, think, rationalise. Some former anorexics are bombarded by remnants of their   pasts. It can be a silently screaming deluge that other people fail to notice. After all, who really reads into a moment’s hesitation at an offer of chocolate cake or the   with the barista that it was indeed skinny milk in your latte? Echoes of my illness can be found in my attempts to retain control of eating situations. I’m not necessarily counting, but neither am I completely free. I cannot suddenly freefall into a frenzy of burgers, burritos and buttermilk pancakes. Returning to normality has to be done slowly, meaningfully and enduringly. Recovery has taught me that wellness goes beyond food and body shape. I eat now to nourish my body and I yearn to be strong and healthy. My concept of elegance has transformed. I hope society’s will one day follow suit. • Tell us what you’re really thinking at mind@theguardian. com

Canada gives $3.3bn subsidies to fossil fuel producers despite climate pledge
Canada’s attempt to act on climate change is being undermined by $3. 3bn in government subsidies flowing to oil and gas producers in the country a year, a new report has warned. The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has vowed to place a national price on carbon dioxide emissions by 2018. Last week, Trudeau said he would not be deterred by the election as US president of Donald Trump, who has called climate change a “hoax” and would forge ahead with the plan to “show leadership that quite frankly the entire world is looking for”. But a study by four major Canadian environmental groups has shown that carbon pricing risks being undermined by billions of dollars in subsidies to fossil fuel interests, from both federal and provincial governments. The $3. 3bn annual subsidy, made up of extraction incentives and research and development, amounts to paying polluters $19 for each tonne of carbon dioxide they emit, according to the green groups. This would conflict, they say, with the planned carbon price, which will ramp up to $50 a tonne by 2022. “This system is like taxing consumers when they buy cigarettes while giving massive tax breaks to tobacco companies that encourage them to produce more cigarettes. It doesn’t make sense,” said Alex Doukas of Oil Change International. Dale Marshall of Environmental Defense added: “Unless Canada phases out massive subsidies to oil and gas companies, Trudeau’s carbon price will do little to encourage polluters to cut carbon emissions. The $3bn in annual subsidies could be put to much better use by investing in climate action, healthcare or other initiatives. ” G20 countries, including Canada, agreed to phase out fossil fuel subsidies in 2009. However, the burning of oil, gas and coal is still supported across the world by subsidies amounting to $5. 3tn a year, equivalent to $10m a minute every day, according to the International Monetary Fund. This huge sum, greater than the total health spending of all the world’s governments, comprises direct subsidies and financial support as well as the externalized cost that people pay for fossil fuels in terms of air pollution and extreme weather driven by climate change. Trudeau has emerged as a vocal proponent of action on climate change and found significant common ground on the issue with Barack Obama. He has said that Canada’s efforts to stave off the worst effects of climate change “will not cease”. However, he has been attacked by environmentalists for not raising Canada’s emissions reduction goal and for approving a controversial $27bn liquified natural gas project in British Columbia. The opposition Conservatives, meanwhile, have called a national carbon price plan “complete insanity” and a “sledgehammer” to the Canadian economy.

Barack Obama’s presidency will be defined by his failure to face down Assad
On Friday, near Palmyra, 14 tanks and an   system were destroyed in an air strike on Isis. Palmyra recently fell to the jihadists after the Syrian regime and its allies diverted forces to Aleppo, leaving the ancient city  . This was a repeat of events last year when, on the advice of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, the regime deployed troops away from Palmyra to the strategically significant metropolis of Aleppo. The planes struck Palmyra on the same day Suleimani was photographed treading the city’s rubble. But the planes weren’t Russian or Syrian: they belonged to the   international coalition. While the US has its own reasons for battling Isis, in this case it was picking up the slack from the regime. Palmyra has only symbolic significance for Assad. Aleppo was the prize, and, with the world watching impotent, the regime was able to starve and bludgeon its population into surrender. The regime was aided by Russian bombers and special forces, Iranian Revolutionary Guards, Hezbollah mercenaries, and a horde of sectarian militias from Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan  —   but, above all, it was aided by American indifference. In an interview with Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic magazine earlier this year, President Obama said he was “very proud” of the moment in 2013 when, against the “overwhelming weight of conventional wisdom” he decided not to honour his own “red line” allowing Assad to escape accountability for a chemical attack that had killed more than 1, 400 civilians. Obama may be alone in this judgment. A year earlier, seemingly on a whim, he had set a red line on the use of chemical weapons at a time when none were being used. The red line was, in effect, a green light to conventional killing. But the regime called Obama’s bluff  —   and, predictably, he backed down. No longer fearing punishment, the regime escalated its tactics. Nearly four times as many people were killed in the two years after the chemical attack as had died in the two years before. Obama’s abandonment discredited Syria’s nationalist opposition and empowered the Islamists. It helped Isis emerge from the shadows to establish itself as a major force. Together, these developments triggered a mass exodus that would displace over half the country’s population. And as the overflow from this deluge started trickling into Europe, it sparked a xenophobic backlash that has empowered the far right across the west. These, however, weren’t the only consequences of Obama’s retreat. The inaction also created a vacuum that was filled by Iran and Russia. Emboldened by his unopposed advances into Ukraine and Syria, Putin has been probing weaknesses in the west’s military and political resolve  —   from provocative flights by Bear bombers along the Cornwall coast to direct interference in the US elections. The     international order is on the verge of collapse. In January, when Obama leaves office, he will be leaving the world a lot less stable than even his predecessor. But in his valedictory press conference, last Friday, Obama defended his policy on Syria  —   albeit with logic whose fractures even his eloquence could not conceal. Inverting cause and consequence, he cited Russian and Iranian presence in Syria as his reason for not confronting Assad (neither was there in August 2013) he cited the disunion among rebels as the reason for not supporting them (they fragmented because they were denied meaningful support) and he cited the fear of deeper American involvement as his justification for restraint (even though a year later it would lead to a far bigger deployment across two states). The administration’s response to the neoconservative depredations of the past decade was to revert to old dogmas: the dogmas of “realism”. Under the influence of doctrinaire realists, Obama concluded that the Arab world was not ready for democracy it needed “strongmen”. The strongmen would protect the west against the twin threats of terror and migration. This logic led the US to back Nouri  ’s sectarian government after the controversial 2010 election in Iraq it also led it to tolerate Assad. Syria was defined narrowly as a counterterrorism problem. But there was also another reason for tolerating Assad. The administration had gambled its reputation on the Iran deal  —   a deal whose success would distinguish Obama from his belligerent and quixotic predecessor. Iranian leaders, however, understood that by investing his legacy in the deal, Obama had also made himself its hostage. He couldn’t make too many demands for fear of undoing his own legacy. Conscious of this, Iranian hardliners saw no cause for constraint. Flush with cash from the deal, they have embarked on a foreign policy far more intransigent than anything Iran has pursued in a century. Tehran has little need for nuclear weapons when it can conquer Aleppo without them. And, as a client of Iran, Assad has enjoyed impunity. Aleppo fell on Obama’s watch. He did not raise a finger to save the city even though he had mobilised America’s vast military assets on short notice to defend Kobani and imposed a   zone over Hasakah. By withholding leverage, Obama also allowed Russia to use the charade of diplomacy to aid Iran and the regime’s military conquest. In January, as Obama surrenders the White House to America’s own strongman, the Iran deal will probably not survive long. Its benefits were already made doubtful by Obama’s invertebracy. It is Aleppo that the world will remember him by. Dr Muhammad Idrees Ahmad (@im_pulse) is author of The Road to Iraq: The Making of a Neoconservative War (Edinburgh University Press, 2014)

Frank Ocean: Endless first-listen review – brilliantly confounding
And so, after all the delays and rumours and teasers and the   live streams, Frank Ocean’s new album is finally here! What, I hear you ask, is Boys Don’t Cry actually like? Erm, we don’t really know. Because Frank Ocean being Frank Ocean, the album he has put out isn’t Boys Don’t Cry. At least we don’t think it is. Instead it’s billed as a “visual album” called Endless. Apparently, it is one big teaser  —   the teaser to end all teasers, if you will  —   before the real thing, with a   title, arrives this weekend. Although haven’t we heard that before? So what, I hear you ask  —   perhaps with a slightly less patient tone than before  —   is Endless like? And what the bloody hell is a “visual album”? To answer the second question, the 18 tracks here have been released as one long video in which Ocean appears to get back on the home improvements game. We see him building a spiral staircase in his warehouse, while rocking various outfits  —   from an impressively baggy Jesus and Mary Chain sweater to a protective suit  —   as the music drifts by. And it really does drift, with brief instrumentals such as Ambience 001: In a Certain Way and the Daft   Hublots acting as segues. They also double up as   throughout what is a rich, varied and  —   at times  —   challenging musical feast.  Because Endless isn’t always an easy listen. There are computerised voices (arty   Device Control) hazy electronic shimmers (In Here Somewhere) and the odd snippet of conversation littered across Endless, the latter providing a pleasingly   counterbalance to what is overall a rather futuristic and lush aesthetic (the London Contemporary Orchestra provide a variety of sumptuous strings). Song structures are often   especially through the second half of the record, where the point at which one song ends and another begins is difficult to keep track of. Strangest of all is the final track, Higgs, which seems to be a   advert for a Samsung Galaxy phone, read aloud by German artist Wolfgang Tillmans over pulsing electronica. It must have thrilled the execs at Apple Music. But the idea that this is a singularly   statement would be wide of the mark. There are clearly songs here, as proved by the swooning synth lines on Commes Des Garçons, or the   Slide On Me, staged over a skittering rhythm and acoustic guitar. It’s just that these tracks have the tendency to dissolve into   voices, or pitch shifts, or electronic bleeps. That’s certainly the case on Alabama, but that shouldn’t discount the fact it also features Sampha’s gorgeously plaintive question: “What can I do to love you more than I do now?”  In fact, soulful melody is in no short supply throughout Endless, and Ocean’s voice ensures it’s delivered more passionately than any other mainstream pop star is managing right now. You realise how much you’ve missed that devastating falsetto the second it hovers into view on a cover of the Isley Brothers’ 1976 hit At Your Best (You Are Love). As Ocean gets busy with a circular saw (those stairs won’t build themselves, you know) the track embodies the merging of RB and sadboy electronica that’s been developing ever since Ocean first emerged. (Hardcore Frankophiles will have heard a slightly different version in a 2015 tribute to Aaliyah.) The influence of James Blake, Sampha and Jonny Greenwood would have been heavily present here even if those artists hadn’t appeared on Endless. Of course, your view of Endless may well depend on how you approach it. If you’re expecting a conveyor belt line of hits, then you will be somewhat disappointed as much of this album floats by hazily and with no clear direction. Endless feels like an artistic statement before a pop album, even if it’s ultimately an impressive merging of the two. You might wonder at times  —   perhaps as beats flicker by and Ocean starts sanding down a particularly rough piece of wood  —   what on earth is going on. But surely the whole point of Frank Ocean is that he likes to confound, and this really does feel like a brilliantly confounding, unique piece of work. And besides, the full pop Frank will undoubtedly be unveiled when whatever Boys Don’t Cry is now called emerges. Probably. Possibly. Who knows with this most mysterious and intriguing of artists? All we can say for sure is that there are rumours that an image of Ocean’s face is gradually being projected on to the John Lewis store in Peterborough, along with a countdown clock to a date in March 2018, when etc etc etc.

(((Echoes))): beating the far-right, two triple-brackets at a time
Like many digital   (are we digital tourists? Immigrants? Reluctant asylum seekers?) I like to assume that social media trends I don’t understand can’t be that important, otherwise I would somehow, maybe telepathically, understand them. So it was with the   around a person’s name on Twitter. On my timeline, which is roughly divided between foodies and lefties, people started to   themselves  —   (((like this)))  —   but this is a response to and subversion of the main trend, which is to   others. The brackets, known as “echoes” are a   invention, to identify Jewish Twitter users, so that other antisemites can then attack them online. The raising of a rabble is not limited to antisemites  —   misogynist fury can likewise manifest in epic crowds,  . But there is something about ((())) that is uniquely unnerving, the secrecy conferring a sense of a developed and organised network of hate. Jonathan Weisman, deputy Washington editor of the New York Times, described how it played out for him following the publication of his article on Donald Trump. A Twitter user triple bracketed him in a tweet, and he was subjected to a sudden hurricane of abuse, images of concentration camps and death threats that has yet to abate.   white supremacists have new allies: the   alternative right, or “ ” promulgators of online viciousness, much of it racist in theme. They cite the rise of Trump as a key factor in their growing confidence, as well as the refugee crisis. They think of themselves as modern, which, to give them credit, they are, since they have managed to weaponise the internet, turning virtual threats into   fear. Their tools are hacking and doxing (publishing personal details, home addresses and other whereabouts, of victims) and often just marshalling huge amounts of hostility on to a single target. Those who want to show solidarity with Jewish people who have been attacked, and indeed, Jewish people generally. The Twitter user @andrewcb explains: “It’s a bit like the urban legend about the Danish king wearing a yellow star during the occupation. ” As the myth has it, King Christian X wore a star in response to Nazi requests that he solve his “Jewish problem” and all the Danish people followed suit, which led the identifier to become meaningless. Nothing makes the   angrier than the puckish appropriation of a tag, trope or practice in order to mock it and show solidarity with those it is intended to offend. Reclaiming symbols, words and hashtags isn’t new: recent examples include the #1in5Muslims hashtag, in response to the Sun’s radically unintelligent reading of a poll, and #DistractinglySexy, in which female scientists responded to Tim Hunt’s evaluation of women in his field by tweeting portraits of themselves at work in the lab or outdoors. Those women came in for some incredible abuse  —   as vilified for objecting to Hunt as he was for his original remark. On the internet, sexism and objecting to sexism are basically interchangeable, in terms of what they cost. But they did it anyway. Yes, you should. I’m going to.

I am a Muslim doctor. I saved a Christian in Pakistan and it nearly cost me my life
I am a Pakistani medical doctor, currently receiving political asylum in the US for the past year and a half. I sought refuge here after having to go through much humiliation and outright hatred for trying to practice ethical medicine and for belonging to a religious minority in my own motherland.  A while back, my father retired from a reputed local bank in Pakistan and moved to the US, along with the rest of my family. I continued to live in Pakistan: I was a fresh medical graduate pursuing the dream of   education in nephrology. Life seemed well on track until one night while working an ER shift, when I received a patient needing urgent dialysis. Unattended and disheveled as he was, there was no one with him to get him the medicine he needed. Fearing he might die, I instinctually grabbed the emergency medicine donated via zakaat, an Islamic system of   and performed the   hemodialysis.  He survived but I immediately faced the wrath of the nurse. She was mad at me because the patient was a Christian and she said Islamic alms are not meant to be used on  . But I did not know the patient’s faith, nor did I know that such a law existed.  I promptly replaced the medicine, which cost around $20. But it didn’t end there. The representative of a conservative Islamic NGO, which was a donor to the clinic, was furious about what I had done. They attributed my lack of knowledge about the alms laws to the fact that I belong to a minority Muslim sect.  A departmental inquiry followed and I was discriminated throughout the entire process. The workplace discrimination gave way to threatening phone calls and vandalism of my car and bike. They found out my family lived in America and that I was alone. This made me an easy target. I was threatened with death at a medical conference hosted by the chair of the same NGO which had complained about me.  Fearing for our lives, my wife, who is also a doctor, and I made it to the US in 2015. We applied for political asylum based on what had happened to us. It took a lot of courage on her part to leave. She had to accept not knowing when she could next visit her family in Pakistan, owing to our asylum status. Life here as an asylum applicant is hard, as I can’t practice medicine. I have a small,   job and study the rest of the time. I am working towards obtaining a license to practice medicine here. All this while, I am also deeply troubled by the discrimination of Muslims in America. I personally feel this country is abandoning the very principles its based on.  The demagogues emerging in this election campaign make me feel that I have no place to seek refuge anymore. My native country is a bedrock of religious fanaticism and presents a certain death for me. Meanwhile my country of asylum is fast enveloping in Islamophobia.  Humanity is the core of any religion. I believe no true Muslim can be an extremist. I knowingly went out of my way to help a human in need, without a thought about his religion. I faced backlash that would change my life forever. But, in the name of humanity, I deem that it was all worth it.  Open contributions: How did you get to the US?

France 2-1 Romania: Euro 2016 opening game – as it happened
Mission accomplished by France, who blended slickness and jitters throughout but were uplifted at the last by Payet, their best player on the night and the scorer of a superb winning goal. That’s a nice start for the hosts to build on, even if plenty of improvement will be needed for them to win here on July 10. 90+3 min: Matuidi releases Sissoko. He could announce his arrival in stye here . .. but instead blasts a   shot wide.  France substitution: Payet ambles off to tumultuous acclaim and sudden national hero status. His replacements wanders on. From the sublime to Moussa Sissoko.  He was the man of the match even before he received a clever short pass from Kanté at the edge of the area   and jinked to his left and curled a sumptuous shot into the top corner! This time last year it didn’t even look like he’d be picked for the tournament, now it looks like he’s won the opening match with a sumptuous goal!  85 min: With a cheeky flash of skill Alibec wrongfoots two Frenchman and bears down on their defence. He briefly considers letting fly from 25 yards but instead flips the ball wide to Stancu, who loses it.  83 min: . .. or for Grigore to bound offside and let them off.  83 min: Kanté takes down Torje, giving Romania a freekick   inside the French half. Another chance for the hosts to show their setpiece defending prowess. .. Romania substitution: Torje on for Popa.  81 min: Martial slaloms in from the left, then rolls the ball to Giroud at the edge of the area. Giroud, holding off the defender behind him, tees up Martial for a shot. But it lacks power and poses no trouble to the keeper.  80 min: There’s audible nerves all around the Stade de France, with both sets of fans knowing victory or a miserable defeat are both still very possible. Meanwhile in Marseille, just look what England fans are up to. Some people just shouldn’t be allowed out of the house.  78 min: Popa booked for pulling back Payet.  Here’s a curious move: Deschamps has introduced Martial for . .. Pogba, who looks momentarily perplexed but then accepts the decision and jogs off, shaking hands with the manager when he reaches the sideline and commissioning a new haircut: Pogbench, perhaps.  76 min: Kanté overhits an intended pass to Sagna, and a France attack fizzles out. 75 min: Coman has made an impact, and France are on the rise again. Coman and Payet combine nicely on the left before releasing the overlapping Evra, who bangs in a good   cross on the run. Giroud tries to sweep it into the net from eight yards but Chiriches beats him to do it bravely. Romania substitution: Chipciu on for Stanciu. 71 min: Romania aren’t merely hanging on for a draw: they know France’s defence is there to be exploited. Alibec bustles his way down the left and stabs in a cross that, once again, is dealt with shoddily. No direct punishment, but Romania now have a corner, and France haven’t been defending them well all night. OK, so they clear this one. 69 min: Giroud booked for inadvertently clumping Pintili with an elbow as the pair jumped for a ball. Pintili looks dazed.  68 min: Canny interplay between Coman and Pogba before the latter lifts a nice ball into Giroud. The striker shows good strength to hold off Chiriches and then roll past him . .. and fall to the floor.  France substitution: Coman on for Griezmann, who just didn’t look sharp. Stancu dupes Lloris and curls a low shot to the keeper’s left while the keeper leans to the right. France’s lead lasted nine minutes. So what will they do now, rebel or fold?  Evra has been a liability all game and has just taken down Stanciu with a senseless tackle.  63 min: Payet delivered flights over a freekick from the right. Giroud gets the jump on the entire Romanian defence and stretches out his left leg to hook the ball back across the face of goal. But Rat scurries back to clear before Pogba pounces.  Romania substitution: Alibec for Andone.  60 min: Sagna hurls himself in front of Rat to cut out a cross but concede a corner. Stanciu delivers an inswinger, and yet again France’s defending is feeble. But Andone heads over.  And that’s why he’s started! Giroud outjumps the goalkeeper to meet a delightfully floated cross by Payet and head into the net! Moments prior to that Tatarusanu made an excellent save to turn away a ferocious volley by Pogba after more wizardry from Payet, but the keeper should have done much better in the challenge with Giroud.  54 min: There’s a strong invisible presence on the pitch: it’s the hole where Karim Benzema would have been if not for, well, whatever.  52 min: France have awoken! At least Payet has. He threads a neat pass through to Giroud, who shoots on the run . .. but scuffs it badly, offering the keeper an easy save. 50 min: France look like they took some sedatives during the break. They were nervous and scatty at times in the first half, but they’ve been downright sluggish for all of this one so far. What’s the Romanian for Pape Bouba Diop? 48 mins: It’s been a great start to the second period by Romania. Pintili does well in midfield to hold of Pogba before playing the ball wide on the right. It’s then played back infield to Stanciu, who clips a lovely pass over to Stancu. The striker, having eluded Rami and Koscielny again, kills the ball on his chest and then tries to volley it goalwards from 14 yards while falling backwards. But he fires the shot a couple of yards wide of the far post. 46 min: Romania get the second half going, knowing they may be 45 minutes away from a fine start to their tournament. And that could mean a victory rather than just a draw. Andone certainly believes: through sheer will power and he barges his way past Koscielny and almost past Rami, too, and into the box. But Rami just about holds him off and clears the danger. “It’s good to see the relatively unknown Romanians holding their own   so far   against their   hosts,” hurrahs Peter Oh. “It’s the   small teams such as Romania and their    stories that make for some of the most compelling stories of big tournaments. ” His team have had some lovely flourishes but Deschamps will be frustrated at   because they have failed to take some decent chances   Griezmann and Giroud both guilty   and they are distinctly brittle in defence. Romania have been stretched close to breaking point a couple of times but they, too, may be frustrated not to be in front, Stancu having had the best chance of the game only to be thwarted by a brilliant reflex save by Lloris. Martial should be introduced soon.   reading: 45 min: That’s a better delivery from Payet! From a corner he finds Giroud on the penalty spot. Again the striker did well to make space, but again he failed to find the target.  44 min: Rat booked for thrusting his foot into Giroud’s chest while trying to intercept a bouncing ball. That gives Payet a chance to deliver another freekick from wide, but again his usual precision is missing. There’s a slight but important scruffiness to France, as if they haven’t quite attuned to the intensity of a competitive match having played nothing but friendlies for two years. 43 min: Payet stands over a freekick way out by the left touchline. It’s a terrible delivery but Romania make a meal of clearing it. They are reprieved when Pogba fails to make a proper connection with a   from 10 yards. 40 min: A strong, cutting run from deep by Matuidi, who colludes with Payet to take out a whole row of opponents with a  . Matuidi then plays the ball wide to Giroud, who had peeled off to the   side of the box. The striker attempts to chip a return pass to Matuidi, who had continued his run, but it’s intercepted.  38 min: More sloppiness at the back by France, again by Evra. His goofing allowed Romania to hoik a pass forward. Andone scampered on to it, beating Koscileny and Rami for pace. But after leaping to take the bouncing ball on his chest, he gets a clatter from Koscielny and goes down in a heap. It should be a penalty! But the ref saw nothing awry. Fortune favours the hosts. 36 min: Payet hurtles down the right and fires a low cross towards Griezmann, who, running on to it at speed, cracks a   shot inches wide!  36 min: If things do change, it won’t necessarily be in France’s favour: they still look shaky at the back whenever Romania venture forward. And it’s not just the centrebacks, as Sagna and, in particular, Evra are being bypassed quite easily. 34 min: The pace is slowing a bit, because Romania are clogging up play and frustrating their hosts. Expect Giroud to be replaced by Martial of Coman early in the second half if things don’t change. 31 min: Chiriches gets the first booking of the tournament for lunging through Giroud from behind.  29 min: Don’t listen to anyone who tries to put a tag on France’s formation. They’re a freewheeling outfit who are all about movement: Payet, for instance, is popping up all over the shop, always to dangerous effect. Deschamps is putting a lot of trust in his players talent and cunning. That’s how it should be.  27 min: After prolonged probing, France feed Pogba, who tries to blem a shot into the top corner from 25 yards. Never looked like coming off.

The horrors of 2016 could have been stopped – with better defenses
There’s always a narrative. This year, it’s that 2016 saw a massive surge for the reactionary  . The world, we are told, has suddenly become very suspicious of itself: millions gnaw their way down into the soil to blot out everything around them. Reaction and nativism are on the rise everywhere. There was Brexit, there was Trump.   Salafists left bodies and wreckage across the Mediterranean from Syria to the Côte d’Azur. There were the petty   of French mayors ordering Muslim women to strip off at the beach. Then there were the vaster, more sprawling   as nominally democratic systems from Turkey to the Philippines started to crumble under the stomping weight of strong men. All this is true, but it’s not the complete picture. This is not, entirely, a surge for the right wing. What we saw in 2016 were the consequences of a political order that’s done everything it can to exclude the left.  As some liberals never tire of pointing out, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. Trump’s victory did not, on the level of the American public itself, mark a sudden swing to the right. Republicans voted for their candidate, just as they always do. And while Trump received more votes than Mitt Romney had four years earlier, Trump won  —   and Clinton lost  —   because the people Democrats usually count on failed to vote for them.  They didn’t vote because the Democrats didn’t really have anything to offer: Clinton’s platform was maniacally sane and aggressively centrist, insisting against all the evidence that America was already great, that all it needed to do was to stay on its current course towards the distant cliffs.  It was pitched to the “moderate Republican” a chimerical creature living somewhere in Arlington, Virginia, some respectable bore in a   house, reading the papers but mostly indifferent to the suffering outside its walls. It didn’t work. Those people all still voted for Trump. All it did was alienate the   people of all races screaming for something different. It’s common for people to put the blame on the   here. They shirked their duty: to vote for the status quo, even if it’s slowly killing them. This complaint is usually unpleasantly whiny. The fact that these people feel entitled to make it points to exactly why they keep on losing. In The Implosion of Meaning in the Media, the philosopher Jean Baudrillard describes this kind of voter alienation as a tactic. The demand political systems make of us  —   “of constituting ourselves as subjects, of liberating ourselves, expressing ourselves at whatever cost, of voting, producing, deciding”  —   are in their own way an exercise of power. In these conditions, resistance takes the form of the refusal to do so: “the renunciation of the subject position and of meaning  —   precisely the practices of the masses”. For decades, centrist figures such as Bill Clinton and Tony Blair encouraged us to approach politics as atomised individuals: not through any kind of collective struggle, not by making mass demands. They tried to get rid of the conditions that allowed radical mass movements to flourish. And the response of the masses has been to fall silent, and not engage. What we’re witnessing isn’t a wave of reactionary populism overwhelming the stable democracies of the west. All the terrifying monsters of this new era  —   racism, nationalism, the ruthless dispossession of the poor, the chiliastic frenzy of a white male subject under constant imagined threat  —   were already there. They’ve been part of the fabric of western society for a very long time.  What’s happened is that political centrists have deliberately blocked any engagement from those who could keep a lid on them. Things like the welfare state and   solidarity  —   the things keeping liberal societies from collapsing into pure bigotry and pure exploitation  —   were always the products of radical   struggles.  Without their influence, capitalism has been left to spiral lopsidedly into its own idiocy, to droop and moisten until it congeals again into the smirking face of Donald Trump. Fascism is just capitalism that’s been left out in the sun for a week. It doesn’t look like 2017 will be much better. The   Marine Le Pen looks certain to make it into the final round of the French presidential election. In 2002, the last time a Le Pen got this far, millions of leftwing voters turned out to vote against her father and for the lesser evil, the conservative Jacques Chirac.  This time her opponent will most likely be François Fillon, a desiccated   Thatcherite peddling   bigotry only a touch lighter than Le Pen’s, someone who knows he has nothing to offer the left, and doesn’t seem to care. It’s getting harder to imagine a repeat of Chirac’s victory. In the US, mainstream liberals are announcing their “Resistance” to a 2017 that’s smashing into the end of December with all the dumb force of a Trump presidency  —   but their ideas mostly consist of giving money to the Democrats.  Whatever form resistance does take, it won’t be that. Politics will boil over in its own resentment  —   and who would want to help it, when it’s done nothing to help us?

Cereal Killer cafe: what will Birmingham make of its new hipster hangout?
It’s been a year since the Cereal Killer cafe in London’s Brick Lane became the focus of an   riot, and its owners received letters saying “die hipsters”. To be fair, not everyone was hostile to the cafe: the morning after the riot in which protesters daubed the word “scum” on the shop window, there were queues of customers paying up to £4. 50 for a bowl of cereal. So how will Birmingham react when a branch of the cafe opens at Link Street in the Bullring next month? With greater sangfroid than excitable Londoners, is my guess. Or maybe not. The second city is already divided  —   and not only between Villa and Blues fans. On the one side, there are those expressing their fabulously downbeat Brummie ennui on Twitter: “2016 carries on its reckless march toward societal collapse: cereal cafe to open in Birmingham,” tweets Hinkypunka. On the other side is the Birmingham Evening Mail, which exclaims: “We’re cerealously excited!” (There’s no excuse for that kind of language.) “The people behind this super cool cafe,” adds the Mail with heroic journalistic objectivity, “will be whipping up all of our favourite treats like Fluff, popping candy chocolate, party rings, hundreds and thousands, jelly and choccie milk and turning them into crazy good snacks. ” I know what you’re thinking: choccie isn’t a word. Or if it is, it kind of proves the point about 2016’s march to societal collapse.  My sister, who lives in Birmingham’s Acocks Green, has a different reaction. “One word  —   beds!” she texts me. When a second London branch opened in Camden Town last year, there weren’t just   tables and chairs  —   but a whole row of beds, many of them featuring   duvet covers like the Super Mario Brothers. Whether this innovation is an abomination or ergonomic boon depends on your politics. It may lead to punters queuing for breakfast clutching teddy bears in their PJs, though, in a fine prefiguring of the end of days. My brother, meanwhile, has a further intriguing perspective: “Not far from Jamie’s Italian. Wonder what he would make of it? Hardly the answer to the nation’s obesity problems. ” Quite so the celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has long been a campaigner for reduced sugar in British food, especially in dishes targeted at children. But the Cereal Killer cafe boasts (if that’s the word) cereals like S’Mores, Superman and Trix, as well as Chocapic from France, Kariot from Israel and Milo from Australia. What’s that noise? It’s my arteries furring at the prospect. But let’s set aside health issues and focus on the real reason people care about the Cereal Killer cafe: the social transformation it apparently implies. “Oh geez,” tweets Aceman, “a Cereal Killer cafe is opening in Birmingham, like we need   hipster crap. ” Hold on, Aceman. Perhaps I don’t understand gentrification, but this kind of retail development doesn’t seem of a piece with what hipster culture usually means: the craft beers, beards and overpriced Jewellery Quarter apartments. Hipsters, surely, are more like the earnest young Texan couple terrorised by   campaigner Lillian Kaushtupper in The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. They arrive in town looking for authentic signifiers of old New York  —   soul food restaurants,    thrift stores  —   rather than the commodified, themed,   retro eating experience the Cereal Killer cafe offers. Surely gentrification is more like what happened in South Park when an eyesore neighbourhood was redeveloped into the   SoDo SoPa (short for “south of downtown South Park”) and whose new identity was validated by the arrival of a branch of Whole Foods. If the Cereal Killer cafe offers gentrification, it’s not what it used to be. Without wishing to be snobbish (there’s no good way this sentence can end) I suspect that those most titillated by the arrival in Birmingham of the cafe are in the same demographic as those wowed by the   of   service at all 18 Birmingham McDonald’s branches. And yet it arrives at a poised moment for the city. Earlier this month, it was revealed that more than 6, 000 people left London for England’s second city last year  —   more appealing to capital quitters than the second, third and fourth most popular destinations (Brighton, Thurrock and Epping Forest, respectively)  —   which are all within 50 miles of London. The data was glossed thus by Jay Islaam in the Guardian: “Londoners, you live in a malodorous  . Come to Birmingham instead. ” Gotta love that Brummie hospitality: welcoming you with one hand and giving you the finger with the other.  But here’s my worry: it’s quite possible that one reason Birmingham became appealing to unhappy Londoners is precisely because it didn’t, until now, have a branch of the Cereal Killer cafe. Those who quit the   sought an escape from the branded and commodified “experience dining” that London offers in crazy numbers. Perhaps the next set of internal migration figures will show Birmingham being supplanted as a destination for Londoners by a city that has kept it real: Wolverhampton or Sunderland for instance. Birmingham, just possibly, may be becoming a victim of its own success. Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion

Even basic phone logs can reveal deeply personal information, researchers find
The mass collection of telephone records by government surveillance programs poses a clear threat to the personal privacy of ordinary citizens, according to US researchers who used basic phone logs to identify people and uncover confidential information about their lives. Armed with anonymous “metadata” on people’s calls and texts, but not the contents of the communications, two scientists at Stanford University worked out individuals’ names, where they lived and the names of their partners. But that was not all. The same data led them to uncover potentially sensitive information about some individuals. One man was found to own a rifle, while another had recently been diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat. Other data pointed to a new pregnancy, a person with multiple sclerosis, and an individual who was gearing up to grow cannabis. The results highlight the extraordinary power of telephone metadata  —   the number called, when, and for how long  —   particularly when it is paired with public information available from services such as Google, Yelp and Facebook. The value of the data, which is not subject to the same legal protections as the content of people’s communications, has long been recognised by the security services. As Stewart Baker, the former general counsel at the US National Security Agency put it in the aftermath of Edward Snowden’s revelations: “Metadata absolutely tells you everything about somebody’s life. ” Patrick Mutchler, a computer security researcher at Stanford, said that while the power of metadata was understood by those gathering the information, the public was largely in the dark because so few published studies have revealed how rich the data are. “That makes it difficult for people with strong opinions about these programs to fight them. Now we have hard evidence we can point to that didn’t exist in the past,” he said. For the study, the researchers signed up 823 people who agreed to have metadata collected from their phones through an Android app. The app also received information from their Facebook accounts, which the scientists used to check the accuracy of their results. In all, the researchers gathered metadata on more than 250, 000 calls and over 1. 2m texts. Analysts who logged into the NSA’s metadata gathering system were initially allowed to examine data up to three hops away from an individual. A call from the target individual’s phone to another number was one hop. From that phone to another was two hops. And so on. The records available to analysts stretched back for five years. The collection window has now been restricted to two hops and 18 months at most. The Stanford study found that armed with one phone number to start from, the NSA program would initially have given analysts access to telephone metadata for tens of millions of people. Once restrictions came into place, that number fell dramatically, but it still meant that armed with a single phone number, an NSA analyst could retrieve metadata on 25, 000 people. Writing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Mutchler describes how on a shoestring budget, he and fellow graduate student, Jonathan Mayer, uncovered a wealth of personal information, some of it sensitive, about people who took part in the study. Through automatic and manual searches, they identified 82% of people’s names. The same technique gave them the names of businesses the people had called. When these were plotted on a map, they revealed clusters of local businesses, which the scientists speculated surrounded the person’s home address. In this way, they named the city people lived in 57% of the time, and were nearly 90% accurate in placing people within 50 miles of their home. Mutchler believes some of the misses came from people not updating their Facebook page when they moved out of their parents’ home, for example, to go to college. The scientists next delved into more personal territory. Using a simple computer program to analyse people’s call patterns, they inferred who among the study volunteers was in a relationship. Once they knew the owner of a particular number had a partner, identifying the significant other was trivial, they report. For the final part of the study, the researchers delved even deeper, to see what sensitive information they could glean from telephone metadata. They gathered details on calls made to and from a list of organisations, including hospitals, pharmacies, religious groups, legal services, firearms retailers and repair firms, marijuana dispensaries, and sex establishments. From these, they pieced together some extraordinary vignettes from people’s lives. The metadata from one person in the study showed they had a long call from a cardiology centre spoke briefly with a medical laboratory answered a number of short calls from a local pharmacy, and then made calls to a hotline for abnormal   monitoring devices. Another participant made frequent calls to a local gun supplier that specialised in   rifles, and later placed a number of long calls to the customer support hotline run by a major gun manufacturer that produced the rifles. Another still placed calls to a hardware store, a locksmiths, a hydroponics supplier and a head shop in the space of three weeks. The metadata from two others suggested one had multiple sclerosis and the other had just become pregnant. “All of this should be taken as an indication of what is possible with two graduate students and limited resources,” said Mutchler, who argues that the findings should make policymakers think twice before authorising mass surveillance programs. “  metadata surveillance programs, like the NSA’s, will necessarily expose highly confidential information about ordinary citizens,” the scientists write, adding: “To strike an appropriate balance between national security and civil liberties, future policymaking must be informed by input from relevant sciences. ” Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, said the study provided numbers that discussions can now be based on. “With the right analytics running over   comms data you can infer huge amounts of sensitive information on everyone. We always suspected that of course, but here’s the data. ”

Over 120 arrested at North Dakota pipeline protests, including journalists
North Dakota police arrested more than 120 people over the weekend at Native American oil pipeline protests, including   and journalists, prompting accusations that law enforcement officials are stifling free speech and using excessive force against peaceful protesters. There were increasingly tense clashes between police and demonstrators against the Dakota access pipeline, which the Standing Rock Sioux tribe says is a threat to its water supply and cultural heritage. Reporters and protesters recently released from jail told the Guardian that police aggressively targeted nonviolent demonstrators with batons and pepper spray and indiscriminately arrested journalists and   before issuing “riot” and “criminal trespassing” charges. “I’ve covered conflicts overseas, and I never imagined I would see this kind of show of force against peaceful people,” said Jihan Hafiz, a freelance journalist who was arrested hours after she arrived on Saturday. “This is the kind of thing you see in the Middle East. ” The Morton County sheriff’s office said a total of 127 people were arrested over the weekend, including two juveniles, and that they were facing a range of charges, including reckless endangerment, criminal trespass, engaging in a riot, resisting arrest and assault on a peace officer. Police officials, who did not respond to a request for an interview, said there had been a total of 269 arrests at the protest since August. The mass arrests occurred less than a week after a judge rejected prosecutors’ riot charges against Amy Goodman, the broadcast journalist and popular Democracy Now! host whose arrest warrant sparked a national outcry about free speech violations. The actor Shailene Woodley also recently made headlines when she was arrested for participating in the protest. Local Native American residents and activists from across the US have traveled to the site to try to block a planned $3. 7bn oil pipeline, which would transport fracked crude from North Dakota’s Bakken oil field to a refinery near Chicago.  The tribe has alleged that the project could destroy sacred lands and has also taken the fight to court. Some say the demonstration represents an unprecedented movement bringing together tribes, indigenous rights groups and climate activists. But law enforcement officials have painted the protests as illegal, dangerous and violent  —   and in recent weeks it appears that police have intensified their response efforts and called in additional law enforcement resources. “From halting traffic with their own roadblocks, trespassing on private property and endangering lives with illegal drones, these are the tactics of    agitators who have an agenda of causing fear, terror, and economic devastation,” Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier of Morton County said in a statement. “Once again, their tactics indicated it was not a peaceful event. ” But journalists and activists told the Guardian that there was a concerted effort to avoid arrests on Saturday and organize a nonviolent action centered on prayer. “They’re saying that we’re rioting when we are just standing there in prayer,” said John Red Legs, a    Standing Rock member who was arrested over the weekend. “I started singing and that’s when they started tackling me. ” The father of six said he was released after a day behind bars and plans to continue protesting. “I’m still going to fight for my kids and my unborn grandkids. ” Dean Dedman Jr, a member of the Standing Rock Hunkpapa tribe from South Dakota, has recorded the protests by drone. Police claimed in a news release last week that the “drone came after us” and that officers fired at it and damaged the device. Dedman, who has contributed video footage to the Guardian, said his drone was never a threat and that he plans to continue filming the demonstration.  “It makes me feel sick to my stomach,” he said of the recent arrests. “They’re pretty much escalating this on their own   …     We’re just sitting here praying. ” Sara   a   who has also provided video coverage for the Guardian, said police confiscated her camera after arresting her on Saturday. “It’s completely ” she said, noting that she was standing in between police and protesters and tried to explain that she was a  . “When you’re there, it’s really surreal. ” Hafiz, who is based in Brazil and Washington DC and covered the Arab spring protests, said police arrested her even after she showed her press identification. In jail, she said, she and other women were subject to humiliating strip searches. As of Tuesday morning, police were still holding her camera as evidence. “It’s very clear that they are trying to create a media blackout,” she said. “The excessive force was completely unwarranted not only against me and Sara as working journalists, but also   …     against people who are unarmed, praying and peaceful. ”

Brazilian police arrest Isis-linked group over alleged Olympics attack plot
Fifteen days before the Olympics opening ceremony, Brazilian police have arrested 10 alleged Islamic State sympathisers who are suspected of planning an act of terrorism during the games. Two others are still at large. The Brazilian justice minister, Alexandre Moraes, described the suspects  —   all of whom are Brazilian  —   as “absolutely amateur and unprepared” but he said they had sworn allegiance to Islamic State, celebrated the recent attacks in Orlando and Nice, and some of them had tried to buy  . He provided few details of those involved but said they were spread across 10 states, had a leader in Curitiba, and kept in touch by the WhatsApp and Telegram messaging services.  “Those involved participated in an online group denominated ‘the defenders of sharia’ and were planning to acquire weapons to commit crimes in Brazil and even overseas,” the minister told a news conference. Brazil’s intelligence agency ABIN is said to have worked with foreign counterparts to provide the information that led to the arrests, which were carried out by members of the police and armed forces mostly in the southern states of São Paulo and Parana.  The suspects did not have bomb materials, nor did they identify a target and some merely discussed taking up martial arts, but one of them had reportedly been in contact with a website offering clandestine guns from Paraguay.  “He requested the purchase of an   gun, to perform an operation,” Moraes said. “There is no information in the investigation that he managed to get this rifle, but the simple act of communication with an intent to buy a rifle is a preparatory act that we had to combat. ” Authorities believe they were preparing a shooting attack similar to the one in Orlando, Florida.  The minister suggested the arrests were precautionary.  “Due to the proximity of the Olympics  —   when we will receive many foreigners  —   Brazil from that point on would start to become part of the target of these people,” he said. The suspects will be held for 60 days. The operation comes after reports that the militant group Ansar   Brazil, which supports the Islamic State, launched a   call for jihad or holy war on the Telegram social network. The government said last week that the threat of terrorism had “reached a higher level” following the killings in Nice, France. In Rio de Janeiro, authorities said they were planning additional security cordons, road checkpoints and body searches at Olympic venues. Following Thursday’s arrests, the interim president, Michel Temer, was due to hold an emergency cabinet meeting.

Trump/Nixon: the parallels are startling
As Donald Trump’s own advisers said this week that Trump would use Richard Nixon’s famous “law and order” rhetoric during his 1968 campaign as his inspiration for his Republican nomination speech on Thursday, many have begun comparing Trump to the disgraced former president. The parallels with a man who presided over another era in which there were widespread allegations of police brutality and killings of unarmed African Americans seem compelling. But if you take a detailed look back at Nixon’s 1968 campaign for president, the analogy runs much deeper than his    language attacking racial minorities. As each day passes, Trump’s success looks more and more similar to Nixon’s rise to power. Just yesterday, Trump campaign surrogate (and widely assumed prospective attorney general) Chris Christie said Trump would seek a new law to purge   federal employees. Trump has also promised to “prosecute” Hillary Clinton if he becomes president, and given the disturbing    of “Lock her up!” during Christie’s convention speech on Tuesday, there’s little doubt he would follow suit. It’s a reminder that Nixon took his own campaign hatchet man John Mitchell and installed him as attorney general to do his dirty work. But long before Nixon ordered Mitchell to wiretap and subpoena journalists who crossed him when he became president, he was threatening to sue the New York Times for libel for an editorial about his   running mate, Spiro Agnew  —   just as Trump has threatened multiple news organizations with libel suits in the past several months. Much like Trump, Nixon and Agnew spent a great deal of their campaign attacking the media, so much so that as former New York Times general counsel James Goodale wrote in his 2011 book on the Nixon administration’s war on journalism: “Many who covered the election for the press said they felt under threat with everything they wrote. ” Just as Trump cajoles his campaign crowds to boo and hiss at the reporters covering him, and hurls insults their way on a nightly basis, Nixon had Agnew tour the country giving entire speeches ripping into television and news media, once famously referring to the mainstream press as “Nattering nabobs of negativism” and “executionary journals   …     fit only to line the bottom of bird cages”. Trump’s   tweets aimed at any journalist who writes an unflattering story about him bring to mind Agnew regularly calling out individual reporters by name in those same speeches. One of Nixon’s favorite tricks against his enemies was to set the IRS on anyone who crossed him. You can hear him on the Nixon tapes demanding that one person or another who had wronged him have their tax returns audited by the IRS. Trump himself has already hinted at using this tactic as well. After Amazon CEO and billionaire Jeff Bezos criticized Trump in May, Trump immediately accused Bezos of owning the Washington Post to avoid taxes and seemingly hinted at a crackdown to come if he were to become president. And then there’s foreign policy. Nixon spent the entire 1968 campaign claiming that he had a “secret” plan to get the US out of Vietnam and that he would bring peace to a country torn up by war  —   all the while covertly planning on escalating the war behind the scenes. You may remember Trump started out his campaign claiming he had a “secret” plan to defeat Isis and has been relentlessly hammering Hillary Clinton for voting for the disastrous Iraq war. Yet at the same time, he supported that war at the time, and has made several comments suggesting he would engage in war crimes, such as torture and killing the families of terrorists. One thing’s for sure: a Trump administration would turn into a golden age for leaks. Just look at the debacle over the plagiarism scandal surrounding Melina Trump’s speech on Monday. There are different factions in his campaign constantly trying to backstab each other by anonymously leaking to the press. Much like under Nixon, and even in a climate of heightened fear for news organizations, you can bet there will be no shortage of civil service employees willing to tell the press all the crimes happening behind closed doors  —   especially now that Trump is promising to fire them en masse.

Microsoft Surface irks NFL coaches and stars: ’I’m done with tablets’
Microsoft might pay the NFL $400m to use its tablets, but that doesn’t stop players, coaches and announcers from complaining about the devices. Last week, the New England Patriots’ head coach, Bill Belichick, went on a     minute rant about the Surface Pro, saying he was going back to using pen and paper. He said: “As you probably noticed, I’m done with the tablets. I’ve given them as much time as I can give them. They’re just too undependable for me. ” This week, both 49ers coach Chip Kelly and quarterback Colin Kaepernick weighed in on the iPad competitor, which is used on the sidelines as part of the sponsorship deal. “There have been times when there are some glitches in them,” Kelly told Mercury News, adding that screen didn’t perform well under the glare of the sun. “Sometimes it doesn’t work perfect and you have to shake it a little bit. ” Kaepernick added, seemingly in jest, that he has sometimes tapped the device on the side to get the screen to unfreeze. “That happens every once in a while and they have to reboot it,” he said. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Microsoft and the NFL entered into a   $400m deal in May 2013, making the   company “the official sideline technology sponsor of the NFL”. This means that it’s the official device used by players and coaches to analyze gameplay. The first challenge Microsoft faced was announcers continually referring to the devices as iPads during broadcasts. Then, in October 2014, Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler described the Surfaces as “knockoff iPads”. Crisis management expert Jonathan Bernstein described the situation as a “classic case of crisis fomented by breakdown between marketing and operations. ” “Marketing is going for the quick money and not even asking if the sponsoring system will work well for teams and coaches,” he said. “For Microsoft, it doesn’t look good to have teams that are unhappy with the device. It’s a much bigger contradiction in terms than to have the average consumer unhappy. ” Bernstein believes the situation could have been avoided through better planning, education and training  —   of players, coaches and broadcasters.  “If I was Microsoft, I’d be sending very   training teams into each NFL team to get them completely comfortable with the system as quickly as possible,” he said.  Despite the criticism, the NFL issued a statement defending Microsoft: “Microsoft is an integral, strategic partner of the NFL and implementing their technology on our sidelines has increased the efficiency and speed of collaboration between coaches and players to an   high. Within our complex environment, many factors can affect the performance of a particular technology either related to or outside of our partner’s solutions,” it said.  Meanwhile, Microsoft reported strong sales of the Surface in its most recent earnings call. Revenue reached $926m in the last quarter, up 38% from the previous year.

Why has ’macho’ Latin America elected more female leaders than the US?
In recent years Latin America has had more female presidents than any other part of the world. Yet none of these women during their triumphant electoral campaigns had to face as biased and derogatory propaganda, as close a scrutiny, as Hillary Clinton in her attempt to become the first woman to be president of the US. Although public opinion has indeed changed and the latest polls suggest Clinton is favoured to win, a decade ago just 60% of Americans thought the country was ready for a female president  —   the same year that Chile elected Michele Bachelet as its first female head of state.  Argentina’s Isabel Peron was the first woman to become president in the region in 1974, and between 1990 to 2014, a record number of women were elected as political leaders. After Violeta Chamorro in Nicaragua, Panama elected Mireya Moscoso in 1999 in Chile, Bachelet in 2006 and 2014 Argentina elected Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in 2007 and 2011 Brazil elected Dilma Rousseff in 2010 and, in the same year, Costa Rica elected Laura Chinchilla. But how is it that in a region which is home to seven of the 10 countries with the highest rate of female murder victims, a region that’s all too known for its reigning machismo, where only less than half of the female population makes an income, women have access to a level of political representation second only to the Scandinavian countries? And why is it that in a culture like the US women have had so much trouble rising in the ranks, while in countries where machismo is the norm, men have been so open minded by comparison?  I believe that behind every macho man there’s an insecure boy in need of mothering, so in Latin America men in all their virile glory have not disputed the suitability of women for the higher office. Machismo divides women into two categories: sexual beings to be conquered and possessed, and mothers as authority figures that embody everything that is virtuous, gracious and worthy of praise in female nature. And in Latin culture the mother archetype is very powerful. In the case of Cristina Fernández, she embodied the widow following the death of her husband, the former president Néstor Kirchner  —   a woman in pain that men are expected to defend and protect. While Laura Chinchilla, who suffered the most   attacks, being younger and attractive, was accepted as the chosen one because of the patronage of former president Oscar Arias. My theory might be questionable and I have no way of proving it  —   it is based on my powers of observation as a writer and my feminine intuition. But having said that, there are two other objective factors: the extraordinary participation of women in the struggles of the 70s and 80s when dictatorial regimes in the region were confronted by popular uprisings, conspiracies and guerrilla groups. In Nicaragua, for example, the first guerrilla force that managed to liberate a major city during the 1979 insurrection was composed entirely of women. We women joined revolts and became experienced in grassroots organising, political activism, diplomacy, and combat. When it came time to build democratic societies, we claimed a place in governments and power structures.  Nevertheless, the trend was still to have women resume their traditional roles. And because many refused to be relegated to status quo and go back to the kitchen or the practice of home economics, they focused their energy on organising powerful social movements, NGOs and feminist organisations. These strengths account for the quotas that have been adopted by 16 Latin American countries and allowed them to have one woman for every four legislators. Only the Nordic countries have higher ratios. It is a big step to have women as presidents, but in the patriarchal structure of power we have all inherited, very often women are still forced to prove that they are as “tough” as the toughest of men. A woman president who would defy the masculine model of power and infuse it with the feminine ethic of caring and real equality is still in the making. Although women as Latin American leaders have many challenges ahead, they have managed to get to the right place, and now they have to be daring enough to seize or declare that it is the right time.

Hillary Clinton regrets ’basket of deplorables’ remark as Trump attacks
Hillary Clinton has expressed regret over her controversial statement that half of Donald Trump’s supporters belonged in a “basket of deplorables”. Clinton made the remark when speaking at a gala event for the group LGBT for Hillary in New York City on Friday night, saying: “You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump’s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? “The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic  —   you name it. And unfortunately, there are people like that. And he has lifted them up. “Some of those folks,” she added, “they are irredeemable. ” In a statement released on Saturday afternoon, the Democratic presidential nominee repeated that she was being “grossly generalistic” but expressed regret for “saying ‘half’” adding: “That was wrong. ” However, she followed with longstanding lines of attack on Trump, saying the Republican nominee had “built his campaign largely on prejudice and paranoia and given a national platform to hateful views and voices”. She also said: “Many of Trump’s supporters are   Americans who just don’t feel like the economy or our political system are working for them. ” Republicans had pounced on her remarks. In a Saturday speech to the Values Voters Summit of social conservative activists in Washington DC, which Trump addressed on Friday, Mike Pence condemned Clinton.  The Republican   nominee said: “The men and women who support Donald Trump’s campaign are hardworking Americans   …     Hillary, they are not a basket of anything. They are Americans, and they deserve your respect. ”  The chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC) Reince Priebus, echoed Pence in a statement, saying: “The truly deplorable thing in this race is the shameful level of condescension and disrespect Hillary Clinton is showing to her fellow citizens. ” Trump, per his habit, initially responded on Twitter. He wrote: “While Hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, I still respect them all!” Subsequently, in a statement, the Republican nominee called Clinton’s remarks “the worst mistake of the political season” and accused her of “showing bigotry and hatred for millions of Americans”.  Trump added: “How can she be president of our country when she has such contempt and disdain for so many great Americans? Hillary Clinton should be ashamed of herself, and this proves beyond a doubt that she is unfit and incapable to serve as president of the United States. ” In an RNC conference call for reporters on Saturday afternoon, congresswoman Marsha Blackburn and pastor Darrell Scott, a   Trump supporter, insisted that Clinton’s comment displayed her “elitism”. They went on to characterize the remarks, which were open to pooled press, as having been made in private and somehow overheard.  Clinton has long targeted Trump’s ties to the   “ ” a fringe   movement with links to white nationalist thought, particularly after Steve Bannon, head of the Breitbart. com news site, became CEO of the Trump campaign in August.  In a speech that month in Reno, Nevada, Clinton said Trump and his supporters were the vanguard of a “paranoid fringe” which had taken control of the Republican party and insisted: “This is not conservatism as we have known it. ” In her statement on Saturday, she said: “What’s really ‘deplorable’ is that Donald Trump hired a major advocate for the   ‘ ’ movement to run his campaign and that [former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard] David Duke and other white supremacists see him as a champion of their values.  “It’s deplorable that Trump has built his campaign largely on prejudice and paranoia and given a national platform to hateful views and voices, including by retweeting fringe bigots with a few dozen followers and spreading their message to 11 million people. ” Trump first came to political prominence in 2011, falsely claiming that President Obama was born in Kenya. He has made a number of racially charged remarks throughout his campaign, which he launched in June 2015 by saying Mexico was deliberately sending rapists to the US. On Twitter on Saturday, the longtime Trump confidante and former Nixon operative Roger Stone embraced the “deplorables” phrase, sharing a meme that grouped supporters of the Republican nominee, including the InfoWars. com host Alex Jones, in a takeoff of the action movie The Expendables.

Sex offender who chained up woman killed at least seven, say police
A South Carolina man killed at least seven people in a hidden crime spree that lasted more than a decade and only was uncovered when police rescued a woman chained at the neck in a storage container, authorities said. Todd Kohlhepp accepted responsibility for an unsolved massacre in which four people were killed, one day before the 13th anniversary of the deaths that stumped authorities, said Sheriff Chuck Wright, who was first elected a year after the murders. On Sunday, relatives of those killed in the massacre gathered in a Spartanburg courtroom. They sat a few feet away from Todd Kohlhepp, 45, as he was denied bond on the murder charges. It was their first chance to face the man accused of killing their loved ones. After the hearing, magistrate judge Jimmy Henson thanked the families for their civility and composure. “I know there’s a lot of hurt . .. beyond what a lot of people understand,” he said. Authorities have charged Kohlhepp with four counts of murder in the 2003 deaths at the Superbike Motorsports motorcycle shop in Chesnee. Kohlhepp’s alleged role in those killings was uncovered, authorities said, after a woman was found last week chained in a locked metal container on Kohlhepp’s property in rural Woodruff. The murder charges against Kohlhepp represent welcome progress for investigators and families haunted by the slayings at the motorcycle shop. The killings shocked the state and left the victims’ parents and spouses reeling with each new rumor about a possible motive. “We got ‘em today. We got ‘em today,” Sheriff Wright said, referring to answers in the cold case. “I’m rejoicing that this community can know that four people who were brutally murdered, there’s no wondering about it anymore. ” A Spartanburg County sheriff’s investigative report from Saturday said Kohlhepp “confessed to investigators that he shot and killed” the owner, service manager, mechanic and bookkeeper of the motorcycle shop, giving details only the killer would know. Now, investigators fear they will make more disturbing discoveries as they unwind a hidden crime spree that unfolded over more than a decade. Kohlhepp is also charged with the woman’s kidnapping, and prosecutors say more charges are expected. Authorities say Kohlhepp is a suspect in at least three other deaths. Authorities were searching again on Sunday on the suspect’s   Woodruff property. Wright said Kohlhepp had shown investigators where he says he buried two other victims there. Those are in addition to the body found on Friday at the site. Authorities identified that victim as    Charles Carver, the boyfriend of the woman found on Thursday. Carver, who died of multiple gunshot wounds, went missing with the woman at the end of August. The Associated Press is not naming the woman because the suspect is a sex offender, though authorities have not said whether she was sexually assaulted. In Spartanburg, Kohlhepp appeared in an orange jumpsuit for the brief bond hearing and declined to make a statement. He did not have an attorney. After Kohlhepp left the courtroom, Henson told the family members they would have a chance later to address Kohlhepp in court. “When it comes your time to speak to that defendant, speak from the heart,” he said. “You have something to say. You’ve been waiting 13 years to say it. ” The father of Brian Lucas, the    service manager who died at the motorcycle shop, thanked the judge. “Your honor, I appreciate your words to us and your counsel,” Tom Lucas said as two others put their hands on his shoulders. “We thank you. ” Standing with his wife before the hearing, Lucas said he wanted to be in court to look Kohlhepp in the eye. “I want to look at him, and I want to try to use that in healing,” he said. He and his wife, Lorraine, said there was a vigil on Friday night to mark the anniversary of the killings, and gatherings were a regular occurrence over the years. Before Kohlhepp emerged as a suspect, investigators said all four victims were killed with the same pistol. They have theorized that the killer came in the back and killed mechanic Chris Sherbert, 26, as he worked.  Bookkeeper Beverly Guy, 52, was found just outside the bathroom, in the middle of the showroom.    shop owner Scott Ponder was found just outside the door, in the parking lot. He was Guy’s son. Brian Lucas was in the doorway of the shop. Kohlhepp was released from prison in Arizona in 2001. As a teenager, he was convicted of raping a    neighbor at gunpoint and threatening to kill her siblings if she called police. Kohlhepp had to register as a sex offender. But that didn’t stop him from getting a South Carolina real estate license in 2006, building a firm and maintaining the appearance of normalcy. Melissa Ponder, who was married to Scott Ponder, said detectives told her Kohlhepp was an angry customer who had been in the motorcycle shop several times. She said that she had resigned herself to Scott Ponder’s death remaining unsolved until she got a phone call on Saturday evening from detectives. “It isn’t closure, but it is an answer,” Ponder said by phone. “And I am thankful for that. ” Another grieving relative who came to the hearing, Terry Guy, was Scott Ponder’s stepfather and Beverly Guy’s husband. He said Kohlhepp’s arrest means relatives of the victims can now finally be at peace. “I’m just so relieved,” Guy said. The building that housed the shop is now shuttered and surrounded by a   fence, along a   highway leading toward the Blue Ridge Mountains. Two miles away in downtown Chesnee, Danny Lee said the killings rattled his quiet hometown of about 900 residents. The    knew the victims and had a bike in the shop for repairs at the time. “He said he did it. We’ve got to take his word for it,” he said of the suspect. “What I still want to know is why. ”

I’m a doctor. The real issue isn’t Hillary Clinton’s health – it’s that she might win
Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton’s health has been under scrutiny in recent weeks, not by medical professionals but by politicians and supposed pundits playing doctor on TV. Clinton’s personal physician, Dr Lisa Bardack, has repeatedly said: “Secretary Clinton is in excellent health and fit to serve as president of the United States. ” Meanwhile, conspiracy theories about Clinton’s supposed ill health have gone viral. There’s no evidence these claims are true. I’m a doctor. I don’t play at being a doctor. I don’t diagnose patients in the absence of unbiased, reliable information, such as performing a physical exam or reviewing tests. When I write or am interviewed on television or the radio, I’ll talk about what new research will mean for patients and the science behind the latest guidelines. I’ll explain why we’re seeing increasing rates of certain diseases and whether policies to combat them make sense. I don’t talk about individuals except to say what one might expect more generally with regard to a particular medical illness. But the scientist in me understands that the real issue here isn’t Clinton’s health. Conspiracy theories signal fear in this case, Trump’s realization that Clinton may well be the next president of the United States. This is not the first time rumors of illness have been deployed to attack a seemingly untouchable political adversary. At a time when Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis had a   lead over then   George HW Bush in the polls, reports circulated that Dukakis suffered severe depression after losing his first   campaign. When asked if Dukakis should release his complete medical records, Ronald Reagan did little to dispel those rumors, saying: “Look, I’m not going to pick on an invalid. ” Some Trump surrogates are also calling on Clinton to release her medical records. Trump has not released his, and a letter from his physician reads as if Trump had written it himself: little in the way of detail but plenty of superlatives like “astonishingly excellent” and “extraordinary”. Meanwhile, in contrast to Clinton and every other presidential candidate in the last 40 years except Gerald R Ford, Trump has yet to release his tax returns. What is different is that Trump gushes conspiracy theories like a fire hose. He was one of the most vocal birthers, those who claimed Barack Obama was a   Muslim and thus ineligible to hold office (that was untrue). Trump later claimed that Clinton started the birther movement, not he. He tweeted: “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing  . ” He said “thousands and thousands” of people in New Jersey cheered the   attacks, implying they were Muslims. He tweeted an allegation that 81% of white homicide victims are killed by blacks. And he suggested that vaccines cause autism. The list goes on. None of these assertions are true. It’s almost as if Trump is reading from a textbook on how to invent and disseminate conspiracy theories. First, target those who feel most alienated and disempowered. Then, identify a complex social or political threat to control, which might include stagnant wages, demographic changes or terrorism. Next, identify an outsider group such as China, Latino immigrants, blacks or Muslims who you can blame. Then tell a simple,    story of conflict between good versus evil, us versus the other. Finally, say the system is “rigged” by the mainstream media or the elite. Trump is riding a rising tide of alienation and disempowerment, most notably among working class white men. They’re his strongest supporters because uncertainty, anxiety and powerlessness drive the need to reassert control. It’s also perhaps why those with a more authoritarian bent tend to favor Trump. Trump shares a certain worldview with his supporters, but he’s also a brilliant psychologist. It should come as no surprise that he “loves the poorly educated”. They’re most likely to buy into his conspiracy theories, and not because they’re stupid. Researchers have found that having less education  —   not sex, race, ideology or knowledge  —   is the most reliable predictor of whether someone will believe a conspiracy theory. Education not only arms us with facts but also teaches us how to think analytically (methodically and scientifically) not just intuitively (from the gut). The scientist in me knows that attempts to debunk conspiracy theories  —   whether they’re about Clinton’s health or the myth that vaccines cause autism  —   are at best futile and may in fact backfire. We pick and choose those facts that add up to the truth we’ve already chosen to believe. The more someone tries to disprove the reality we’ve constructed, the more we dig in our heels. In 2008, questions about President Obama’s citizenship intensified with his likelihood of clinching the Democratic nomination. So long as the odds of winning the election remain in Clinton’s favor, we can expect to see more conspiracy theories emerge between now and November.

’I’ve never met an editor like him’: Bryan Curtis on Bill Simmons and Grantland
Who killed Grantland? It’s a question that sustained a new and seemingly inexhaustible   of sports media in past year, and was the source of much conjecture and conspiracy theory among hardcore fans of ESPN’s late,   sport and pop culture website when it was shuttered by its financiers in September 2015. The way former Grantlander Bryan Curtis tells it, it was a pretty simple equation: one day the site’s founder and most popular writer Bill Simmons was an employee of ESPN, the next day he wasn’t. Created especially for Simmons by the sports media giant, Grantland was on borrowed time the minute its    was effectively sacked (“It was business,” said ESPN president John Skipper) after doubling down in his criticism of NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, also commonly known as the media empire’s most important client. Media critics would soon feast on Grantland’s abrupt closure, but Curtis learned the website’s fate as he stood in the maternity ward of a hospital celebrating the birth of his daughter Stella. “Check your email,” read a text from Simmons’   replacement editor Chis Connelly. “ESPN created Grantland for Bill and when Bill no longer worked for ESPN there was no Grantland,” says Curtis, who is in Melbourne for the Sports Writers Festival. “It’s pretty much as simple as that. ” Still, there’s some irony in the fact that a website whose devotees came to prize the array of distinctive, diverse, and   voices on offer was in the end so obviously tied to the downward trajectory of one man. “It assumed a larger identity,” Curtis says of the site’s cast of star writers.  Before Grantland’s launch in 2011, there had actually been dire predictions that Simmons would merely curate a kind of journalistic   society where everybody wrote and thought like him (“a bunch of people doing a Bill impression,” is how Curtis terms it) but his   staff were encouraged from the outset to pursue subjects and modes of expression that appealed most to them.  “By the end it had its own identity,” says Curtis, who lists Brian Phillips, Katie Baker, David Shoemaker and Shea Serrano as writing talents who flourished and attracted significant followings on the strength of their original approaches to sport and pop culture. “Bill uniquely saw that something like this could work. He either directly hired or had a hand in hiring everybody who worked there. So I think that particular, wonderful, magical combination is totally Bill. ” Another success of Grantland, Curtis says, was that from the outset its creators had a “no asshole” hiring policy (“I’ve worked at places that have an   policy,” he laughs) so there were no tortured geniuses or divas in the building, just a hive of creative energy, ambition and positivity. “Bill was the ultimate ‘player’s coach’,” says Curtis. “He wanted you to succeed on your own terms and find the best version of you. He pushed you to achieve that. The first question we were asked was, ‘What are you interested in?’ and ‘What’s the piece you really want to write?’ and then you did that. That doesn’t happen everywhere. Most publications say ‘What is the piece that we would like you to write that you would most like to write?’ “And the second question was always, ‘What form would you like to write it in?’ Oral history? A reported piece? A sort of column that comes out of some strange and previously not accessed part of your brain? It was all at our fingertips. We could deliver it any way we wanted to as long as it was really good. ” Perhaps misunderstood by some of its critics, Simmons’ new   website, The Ringer, retains much of Grantland’s DNA (former Grantlanders Serrano, Shoemaker, Baker, Juliet Litman, Chris Ryan and editor Sean Fennessey have reunited with their old boss) but it can’t lean on ESPN’s infrastructure in the way Grantland could there’s no nuts and bolts game recaps, nor straighter, more traditional and news reportage on the site to give writers the same time and creative breathing space.  At the Ringer, if a   boxing bout finishes late on Saturday night, it is written about immediately, not the following Monday, as was often the case at Grantland. Much of the content is shorter, reacting more quickly to the news cycle. In other words, there are slightly fewer sprawling Japanese gonzo epics loosely related to sumo wrestling, slightly more instantaneous opinion on topics as varied as Bob Dylan’s Nobel Prize win or Russell Westbrook’s latest fashion travesty, and yet the new site is still home for fictitious oral histories of Space Jam and deep dives into the eerie prescience of Hank Scorpio, a   Simpsons character from 20 years ago. “One of Bill’s great attributes as an editor is that he’s willing to entertain so many ideas and so many different forms of journalism,” says Curtis. “He’s not as worried about making something fit a schematic, like a lot of editors are. I’ve never met an editor who is quite like him. ” For his signature writing style  —   which first came to worldwide attention in the early 2000s and spawned legions of imitators  —   Simmons is generally given his dues, as he is for the pioneering BS Report podcasts, which made an art form of the kind of unscripted sport and pop culture talk so often murdered by bad sports radio shows. Yet for all the change he wrought in sportswriting  —   and all the writers he’s dragged along in his slipstream through Grantland and his new multimedia ventures  —     is still a growth industry. There have been some teething problems. HBO are getting neither ratings nor critical plaudits for The Ringer’s accompanying TV project, Any Given Wednesday, which still needs to time to establish itself breathing space that critics are less inclined than ever to grant such an outsized sports media figure. At the very least, HBO have got themselves an explosive talent and a tastemaker. “He is inseparable from Grantland and he’s inseparable from The Ringer,” Curtis says. “To use his political capital to give us a chance to do great stuff and change our careers. ..it’s really, really amazing to me. ” Will such a playground for more leisurely,   creativity as Grantland exist again, or was ESPN’s   boutique site just a hell of a lot of fun while it lasted? Could lightning strike twice? “I hope it does,” says Curtis.  He points to the trend for other influential “brand name” journalists  —   Peter King at Sports Illustrated and Yahoo! Sports’ Adrian Wojnarowski are two he he mentions  —   going to media companies and asking for their own curated sites as proof it’s the old hands of US sportswriting who are creating openings for new and vibrant voices in the digital age, perhaps unexpectedly so.  “You never would have predicted that Grantland would have existed,” Curtis says. “I think we live in a   world now rather than a   world, so the writers are the   brands, who can create something like [Grantland]. ” Still, someone needs to fund it. Putting aside Simmons’ efforts to give a platform to so many new and exciting voices in writing, Grantland couldn’t and wouldn’t have existed without ESPN’s deep reservoirs of cash. “I’m really grateful that ESPN did that,” Curtis admits of the   deadlines and open vistas Grantland offered. “When it was happening it seemed like a dream job. The job was so great that I had a feeling in the pit of my stomach for four years that it would come to an end at some point,” he laughs. “It was an incredible investment in all senses of the word. ” Now, says Curtis, it’s a case of moving on to something original and trying to push the digital format in new directions. “We want to create something completely different,” he says. “You can’t do the same thing twice. You can’t recapture things that are gone, no matter how wonderful they were. ”  Since starting at The Ringer, Curtis himself has branched out into a style of   podcasting, drawing upon both his reporting and   skills.  This week he’s surveying the Australian sports media scene with a view to writing one of his signature deep dives, though it’s an item that might sit incongruously alongside posts on Colin Kaepernick and Donald Trump. If the spirit of Grantland lives on, there’s surely no better example than a thorough consideration of Robbo and Caro. What other   editor than Bill Simmons would give such esoteric material the green light? “I’ll look back on it as a magical, fun, creative period,” Curtis says of Grantland. “But I also think it’s one of the few times in my career where the only impediment to being great was me. A lot of times in journalism we’re held back  —   or we think we’re held back  —   by the format of the publication, the editor or the time we had to work on something. All the usual excuses. A lot of that was basically thrown out the window [at Grantland] and the only governor of how good we could be was ourselves. That to me was really unique, and the thing I’ll always remember. ”

Wells Fargo eliminates sales quotas after unauthorized accounts scandal
Wells Fargo will eliminate sales goals for all of its retail banking products by January, the bank announced on Tuesday. The decision comes less than a week after the largest US bank reached a deal with regulators and agreed to pay $185m in penalties for its illegal sales practices.  More than 5, 000 employees were fired by Wells Fargo after an investigation revealed that they were opening deposit and credit card accounts without permission from its customers in order to meet sales quotas enforced by the bank. According to regulators, as many as 1. 5m deposit accounts and 565, 000 credit card accounts could have been opened without customers’ consent. “We are doing this because we want our customer to have full confidence that we are focused on their best interests. We deeply regret what happened and we are committed to making it right,” Richele J Messick, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said in an email.  As part of the settlement, Wells Fargo agreed to hire a consultant to review its sales practices and refund the fees paid by consumers on the accounts that were opened without their permission. So far, customers have been refunded $2. 6m in unwarranted fees. According to the bank, “accounts refunded represented a fraction of 1% of the accounts reviewed, and refunds averaged $25”. The issue of unauthorized duplicate accounts was first reported by the Los Angeles Times in 2013. At that time, a personal banker working at Wells Fargo was expected to sell 20 products a day.  “I am not sure how that’s possible within an   day of work. Pretty much every customer takes an hour,” Khalid Taha, a former Wells Fargo employee, told the Guardian in 2015. “[In 2014] the sales goal dropped to 15 products a day, which is still unreasonable. You don’t sell more than a product per customer. You can, but it’s not that easy. And most of our customers are current customers. They already have several products. ” Some employees  —   including Taha  —   have previously attempted to draw attention to the issue by staging a protest in front of the bank’s headquarters in Minneapolis.  About 5, 300 employees were fired over a   period. Richard Cordray, the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau which levied a $100m penalty on Wells Fargo, said it was not a coincidence that so many employees were involved.  “It’s a systemic breakdown,” he said in an interview with CNBC. “Obviously employees were sharing information with one another. They were doing things together. And 5, 300 or more of them have now been fired. That was a huge problem. It should not occur at any bank. And it should not have occurred at Wells Fargo. ” Cordray pointed out that this is the largest penalty levied by CFPB so far. He added that while there is no indication that this is happening at other banks, all banks with incentive programs should monitor them closely. The Wells Fargo settlement is a “loud and serious warning” to other banks, he said.  In a statement announcing the elimination of sales quotas, Wells Fargo chief executive John Stumpf noted that the bank has strengthened its “control and oversight” over the past several years.  “The elimination of product sales goals represents another step to reinforce our service culture, helps ensure that nothing gets in the way of our ability to achieve our mission, and is consistent with our commitment to providing a great place to work,” said Stumpf.

Nonsense paper written by iOS autocomplete accepted for conference
A nonsensical academic paper on nuclear physics written only by iOS autocomplete has been accepted for a scientific conference. Christoph Bartneck, an associate professor at the Human Interface Technology laboratory at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, received an email inviting him to submit a paper to the International Conference on Atomic and Nuclear Physics in the US in November. “Since I have practically no knowledge of nuclear physics I resorted to iOS autocomplete function to help me writing the paper,” he wrote in a blog post on Thursday. “I started a sentence with ‘atomic’ or ‘nuclear’ and then randomly hit the autocomplete suggestions. “The text really does not make any sense. ” “The atoms of a better universe will have the right for the same as you are the way we shall have to be a great place for a great time to enjoy the day you are a wonderful person to your great time to take the fun and take a great time and enjoy the great day you will be a wonderful time for your parents and kids,” is a sample sentence from the abstract. It concludes: “Power is not a great place for a good time. ” Bartneck illustrated the paper  —   titled, again through autocorrect, “Atomic Energy will have been made available to a single source”  —   with the first graphic on the Wikipedia entry for nuclear physics. He submitted it under a fake identity: associate professor Iris Pear of the US, whose experience in atomic and nuclear physics was outlined in a biography using contradictory gender pronouns. The nonsensical paper was accepted only three hours later, in an email asking Bartneck to confirm his slot for the “oral presentation” at the international conference. “I know that iOS is a pretty good software, but reaching tenure has never been this close,” Bartneck commented in the blog post. He did not have to pay money to submit the paper, but the acceptance letter referred him to register for the conference at a cost of US$1099 (also able to be paid in euros or pounds) as an academic speaker. “I did not complete this step since my university would certainly object to me wasting money this way,” Bartneck told Guardian Australia. “. .. My impression is that this is not a particularly good conference. ” The International Conference on Atomic and Nuclear Physics will be held on   November in Atlanta, Georgia, and is organised by ConferenceSeries: “an amalgamation of Open Access Publications and worldwide international science conferences and events” established in 2007. An organiser has been contacted by Guardian Australia for comment. Bartneck said that given the quality of the review process and the steep registration fee, he was “reasonably certain that this is a   conference with little to no commitment to science. “I did not yet reply to their email, but I am tempted to ask them about the reviewers’ comments. That might be a funny one. ” The conference’s call for abstracts makes only a little more sense than Bartneck’s paper. “Nuclear and   material science it the investigation of the properties, flow and collaborations of the essential (however not major) building pieces of matter. ” A bogus research paper reading only “Get me off Your Fucking Mailing List” repeated over and over again was accepted by the International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology, an   academic journal, in November 2014.

Experience: my cat saved me from a fire
Early one morning last February, I felt the thud of my cat Tink’s paws as she landed on my legs. I was fast asleep and she woke me up, which had never happened before. It was completely uncharacteristic: she sleeps downstairs and never comes into the bedroom. I sat up feeling groggy because I’d been out the night before, but I soon realised something was very wrong. The room was   with a layer of white smoke, eerie and alarming, hanging in the air about three feet deep like a bank of white cloud. I woke up my partner, Russ, in a panic and we jumped out of bed. As we waded through the thick smoke, I was still trying to process exactly what was going on, and the danger only really hit me when I went out on to the landing. Our son Jake, 19, had woken up, too, and as he opened his brother Scott’s door, black smoke billowed out. The smoke from Scott’s room curled up to the ceiling it was only then that the smoke alarm was triggered. Scott, 22, emerged, shouting above the racket that he was struggling to breathe. I phoned the fire brigade, who told us to leave the house as quickly as we could. It was a massive wrench, leaving all of our belongings behind, but we knew we had no choice. We assumed Tink had slipped out of the house, too. Within minutes, six fire engines arrived. As I stood blearily in the road, I looked at our house and realised that the source of the fire was actually our   neighbour’s  —   flames were licking the front of her house. She had also managed to get out and was later taken to hospital for smoke inhalation. I dreaded to think what was happening in our house as the smoke poured out of the windows. I couldn’t bear to look. For half an hour, our two houses were drenched with water until the firefighters were satisfied that the blaze was out. By now, however, our assumption that Tink was safe began to falter. We assumed she had managed to escape, but there was no sign of her. Russ told a firefighter and, even though he wasn’t meant to, he went back into our house to look for her. After a few moments he emerged with Tink, completely limp and draped over his arm. She wasn’t breathing and her tongue was hanging out. He had found her behind a cupboard in Jake’s room. We assumed she was dead, and I felt heartbroken she had saved us but died in the process. Then the firefighter put an oxygen mask on her and incredibly she took a breath and coughed. She was alive. Groggy and stinking of smoke, but alive. She had an   injection at the vet’s later that day and was lively enough to show her displeasure at having the soot washed from her fur. As our house was drenched and   we had nowhere to live, so Tink went to my daughter Lesley’s while we stayed in a hotel for a month. It took weeks to recover from the trauma of what had happened. One corner of our house had been burnt and all our belongings were ruined. I was especially devastated to lose all my photographs and couldn’t bear to open a cupboard to see what was salvageable. It all felt dreadful, but at least we were alive. When we went to visit my daughter, it was clear that Tink had been traumatised, too. She was clingy and timid, refusing to leave my lap when I tried to get up. We have moved into rented accommodation while our house is renovated and Tink has finally come back to us. The source of the fire was electrical  —   forensics are gauging exactly what  —   and the smoke had seeped through the vents between our terraced houses. The firefighters told us we would have had six minutes to get out before we died in the fire, so Tink’s sixth sense saved us. She could have deserted us, but she came up to the most dangerous   area to warn us. Generally cats aren’t known for their altruism, but she is the exception. • As told to Emily Cunningham.

Heisman Trophy winner Rashaan Salaam found dead in Colorado park
Rashaan Salaam, who won the 1994 Heisman Trophy at the University of Colorado before a   NFL career, has been found dead in a Colorado park aged 42. The Boulder County coroner’s office said on Tuesday that it was still investigating the cause of death of Salaam, who was found at Eben G Fine Park shortly before 9pm on Monday in Boulder.  A report from the county sheriff’s office indicated there was no suspicion of foul play, while the Boulder Daily Camera reported that Salaam’s death is suspected to be a suicide after police found a note. “They said they found a note and would share that with us when we get there,” Salaam’s mother, Khalada, told USA Today Sports. Salaam played three years at Colorado, posting one of the most prolific individual seasons in college football history as a junior in 1994, when he ran for a   2, 055 yards and 24 touchdowns in leading the Buffaloes to an   record and a No3 finish in the final Associated Press poll. After forgoing his senior season to enter the 1995 NFL draft, the 6ft 1in, 224lb running back was chosen by the Chicago Bears in the first round and rushed for 1, 074 yards and 10 touchdowns as a rookie, becoming the youngest player in NFL history (21yrs, 7mos) to run for more than 1, 000 yards in a single season. But his production dropped sharply and injuries piled up in two subsequent years with the Bears, prompting his release in April 1998. He played in two games with the Cleveland Browns during the 1999 season before a brief stint with the Memphis Maniax of the XFL in 2001. A series of comeback attempts in the NFL and CFL fell short.  “The Buff Family has lost an outstanding young man and a great Buff today,” University of Colorado athletics director Rick George said in a statement. “We are heartbroken for Rashaan and his family and our thoughts and prayers are with them at this very difficult time. ” In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is    . In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

People who film police violence are citizen journalists. We stand with them
As the filming of police killing unarmed African Americans has led to a wave of protests and calls for reform across the US, one aspect of the controversy has received little attention: the    targeting, harassment, and arrest of many of those who recorded and publicized the killings in the first place. Today, dozens of   and nominated documentary    —   including Laura Poitras, Alex Gibney and many others  —   published an open letter calling on their fellow   to defend these brave citizen journalists and activists who are now seemingly targets of the police themselves. They are also demanding the justice department investigate the disturbing pattern of police abuse. With little media attention, many of the people who filmed the most notorious police killings in the last two years have subsequently been stalked and arrested by the very police departments that they filmed. The two most recent killings that made headlines around the country  —   the death of Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota  —   are only the latest examples. Taken together, the pattern is startling, and for the first time, the letter’s organizer, director David Felix Sutcliffe, has catalogued many of these incidents in one place. After Castile’s fiance, Diamond Reynolds, filmed his dying moments on Facebook Live, she was cuffed, locked in a police car, separated from her child and held in police custody for eight hours. “My daughter will be forever scarred by what the police did,” she said afterwards. “They took me to jail. They didn’t feed us. They put me in a room and separated me from my child. They treated me like a prisoner. ” The owner of the convenience store outside where Sterling was killed, Abdullah Muflahi, was also arrested by police, had his cellphone footage confiscated without a warrant, and was also locked up for four hours in the back of a police car. He has filed a lawsuit against the police officers involved. Chris LeDay, one of the first to post the video of Sterling’s death that caused it go viral, was surrounding by military police at his job the next day. As Sutcliffe described: “They not only handcuffed him, but also placed him in  . He was delivered to a local jail, stripped of his clothing, ordered to wear an orange jumpsuit, locked in a cell, and told he’d have to wait seven days before seeing a judge. ” The list goes on. The man who filmed the Eric Garner murder, Ramsey Orta, accused the NYPD of stalking him afterwards and filming him. He was eventually arrested multiple times and recently pled guilty to weapons charges. Two weeks after Kevin Moore filmed part of the Freddie Gray incident, he was arrested while police pointed assault rifles at him (no charges were filed). He later told Vice News: “Police sit outside my son’s school. And they ride past taunting me with their phones up. ” Taken together, these incidents show a clear pattern of abuse and this should be a controversy in and of itself. Almost all police departments have been forced to concede in recent years that everyone in the United States has a first amendment right to record the police in public spaces. So while they can’t prosecute people for filming them killing unarmed civilians, it’s clear that police departments are using their position of power to intimidate those who have led to more scrutiny of police and to send a message to those who may attempt to do so in the future. Sutcliffe, who   the documentary (T) error that relied on unauthorized footage of entrapment stings by the FBI, wrote that he was inspired to organize the campaign because of the fear of government retribution nearly led to the film being suppressed. “Fortunately,” he wrote, “the documentary community rallied to defend us, and denounced the threat posed by our circumstances, not just to the fate of our film but to free speech and a free press. ” Those who record and publicize police violence deserve the same. But more than that, they deserve to have their first amendment rights protected  —   not just as they film, but afterwards  —   to prevent the next person from being frightened off before they turn on their camera.

Saudi blogger Raif Badawi faces further round of flogging, supporters say
Raif Badawi, the imprisoned Saudi blogger whose public flogging in 2015 generated global outcry, now risks a new round of lashes, according to his supporters.  Evelyne Abitbol, who founded the Raif Badawi Foundation with Badawi’s wife, said a “reliable source” in Saudi Arabia claims he faces a new flogging after being sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment and 1, 000 lashes in 2014 for breaking the kingdom’s technology laws and insulting Islam.  Saudi embassy officials in Ottawa and Saudi government officials in Riyadh were not immediately available for comment.  Reuters was unable to independently confirm the source’s claims. Abitbol declined to name the source but said it was the same person who had alerted Badawi’s wife, Ensaf Haidar, in 2015 before he received his first 50 lashes, the only part of the flogging that was reportedly administered.  The source did not indicate when the flogging would take place.  “Unfortunately, it could happen at any time, if it happens,” Abitbol said by phone in Montreal. Abitbol said that Haidar has asked countries with ties to Saudi Arabia, including the Canadian government, to intervene on the blogger’s behalf.  Haidar, who is in Germany to present a journalism award on Wednesday in her husband’s name, could not be immediately reached for comment. She was granted asylum in Canada, where she lives with the couple’s three children in the province of Quebec.  Abitbol, the foundation’s director, wants Saudi Arabia to withdraw the flogging punishment, strip Badawi of his Saudi citizenship and let him leave the country for Canada.  In December 2015, Badawi was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought by the European Parliament.

Mellow yellow: Kenya’s mosques and churches painted ’in the name of love’
The   artist Yazmany Arboleda is painting the city of Nairobi yellow  —   or at least its houses of worship. As part of his public art project Colour in Faith, religious buildings from mosques to churches are being washed in lemon yellow as a symbol of peace among all religions. “The goal was to take houses of worship in Kenya and paint them yellow in the name of love,” says Arboleda from his studio in New York City. “The idea from the beginning was to turn buildings into sculptures that speak to our shared humanity. ” But yellow? It’s a bit of an eyesore on the street. “People think our photos are Photoshopped because the yellow is so saturated,” says Arboleda, who chose the colour for its brightness and warmth. “‘Optimistic yellow’ is the paint name. ” It all started in 2015, when Arboleda was in Nairobi for an artist residency. He has been making public art since 2006 and is best known for his pink balloon project, used as a symbol of peace in Kabul after a Taliban attack in 2013. Arboleda met Nabila Alibhai, the founder of In Commons, a civic engagement organisation. “We talked about our shared humanity and our highest goals as people across religions,” he says. “How do we disarm each other through beauty? And how do we do that across lines of language, religion, ethnicity and politics?” He was inspired by Barack Obama’s visit to Nairobi in August 2015  —   which a CNN journalist said was potentially dangerous, labelling east Africa “a hotbed of terror”. The Twitter hashtag #someonetellcnn trended for days ahead of the US president’s visit, criticising the news network, until a CNN executive flew to Nairobi to apologise for publishing the article. It wasn’t easy convincing the sheiks, pastors and imams to jump on board. Initially, Arboleda went to the top religious councils in the country to reach the largest number of buildings. “We learned these councils are powerless,” he says. “We had to go to pastor to pastor, priest to priest, imam to imam, sheik to sheik. ” Arboleda found 14 houses of worship willing to be painted yellow, but due to the murky nature of religious bureaucracy, only three followed through. One mosque wanted him to prove that yellow was representative of Islam, while one church wanted financial support for participating in the project. “At that point, I went home and cried,” Arbodela recalls. “I was so heartbroken. We were trying to make a statement about unity and beauty but even with a shared vision, there are still limitations and challenges. Thankfully, we found people willing to collaborate in a more transparent way. ” The first religious institution to jump on board was the Jeddah Mosque Kambi, which was painted in September 2015. “The sheikh, from the very beginning, was so willing to support the cause and help connect us to other institutions,” says Arbodela. “He enabled the dream. ” Next came the    Holy Trinity Parish and the Baps Swaminarayan temple. By the end of the month, Arbodela will have finished painting the Jesus Is the Key of Life church  —   with three more buildings in the works. According to a the CIA factbook, 83% of Kenyans are Christians and 11% are Muslims, along with smaller Buddhist and Hindu communities. “In Kenya, religion is a way to control society,” says Arboleda, who is not religious but considers himself spiritual. “To ask questions and have a dialogue is incredibly powerful for these communities. ” Volunteers paint the buildings with supplies from Uganda’s Sadolin paint company, which has donated 5, 000 litres of paint. Up to 70 volunteers at a time paint together, all from different religious communities. At one point, Arboleda saw a Muslim girl getting to know Christian girls her age. “To see people smile and talk to each other is beautiful. ” When Arboleda lands in Nairobi next month, he will start painting   mosque and then travel to the coastal city of Mombasa to paint   mosque, the Anglican Church of Kenya, the Masjid Musa  —   a controversial mosque that hit the news when suspected radicalised Muslims changed its name in 2014  —   and the Majengo Salvation Army church, which has twice been attacked. “This is a big deal for us, because both of these buildings were affected by the radicalisation struggle in 2012 to 2014,” said Arbodela. “Art helps us reconsider ourselves and our thoughts about others. ” As if painting two towns yellow wasn’t enough, Arbodela recently started work on a public monument in Nairobi, which will launch next year. “We’re going to call it the Open Palm Park and, yes, we will probably paint the monument yellow. ”

I’m a Democrat, but I fear the elitism overtaking the party
I may believe in women’s reproductive rights and LGBT equality and background checks for gun purchases, but I also took childhood naps each Thanksgiving under the watchful glass eyes of my cousin’s prized deer head mount. And I may now work in the   journalism world, but I spent my formative summers wandering around my Illinois hometown’s “Bagelfest” an homage to one of our community’s several factories and its   heritage. That’s all to say: the American electorate is complicated. But there is a narrow perspective that many liberals in my adult life use to paint the people from my hometown, and from the thousands of other places like it.  In that painting, it’s just the people reached on landlines that admit they plan to support Donald Trump who actually do. And those Trump voters time and again are given a suspiciously similar face: white male blue collar. And then those less neutral descriptors: racist sexist uneducated. The first three are often shorthand for the second set. The Democratic party  —   and by that, I mean the party gatekeepers with power to wield media influence, which worked out great for the Brexit vote  —   are writing off those hardcore racists as an overblown minority that is making more noise than they can translate into votes. But overlooking “regular Joe” moderate voters like the ones who filled my childhood could be our undoing. My party has gotten cocky, and I fear that condescending mentality will lose us this election. Because for all of his divisive bluster, Trump has gotten one thing right time and again:   America is not doing great. Don’t get me wrong: I sure as hell won’t be casting a ballot for Trump this November. But I have watched this primary season unfold through a different lens than my very liberal coworkers and fellow New Yorkers, who live in a world that’s largely bounced back from the recession. Where my family lives, factories are closing. Schools don’t have enough money for teachers, and all of Barack Obama’s hope and change hasn’t done much trickling down in the last eight years. And just because the moderate voters living in these areas aren’t showing up at Trump rallies or plastering your Facebook wall with tirades about Muslims doesn’t mean they’re planning to support Obama’s heir apparent come November.  That’s a hard truth for a lot of liberals with   jobs and HBO subscriptions to process, but it’s a truth nonetheless. It’s a truth that is driving Trump fans who really do want to build a wall and “punish” women who have illegal abortions, but it’s a truth for millions of other middle America (yes, mostly white) voters who are overlooked once the primary race bunting comes down and the bandshells empty back out.  Especially in this election, minorities are being courted by Democrats  —   and considering how many Trump lines they have to choose from, the sell is pretty easy. For everyone else, it’s a disconcerting binary: either you’re a racist homophobe or you’re obviously not voting for Trump, so great, we don’t need to even bother paying lip service to your concerns. Even if Clinton does win in a landslide, what I fear most is the elitism my party is embracing, and its ultimate cost.  Some of the people I grew up with are racist. Plenty more are sexist. And a lot of these mainly white midwesterners ventured no farther than the state college. But those are descriptors that also work on plenty of the liberals I’ve met in Boston, Chicago, New York  —   they just keep those views to themselves while living in much more diverse places. And that lets them off the hook. It sets up that insidious dismissal of anyone who doesn’t live like them, who doesn’t think like them. The stakes for our country are too high to tip those voters toward Trump and then shrug as though that was a preordained result. I believe in the Democratic party’s ability to break barriers  —   it’s why I wore a “Hillary is my Homegirl”   to high school back in 2008. The last thing we need right now is more walls.

Charlotte police to show shooting video to Keith Scott’s family but not public
The family of Keith Scott planned a press conference on Thursday afternoon to discuss his death after being shot by Charlotte police, but did not attend because they were “emotionally not ready” according to their attorney.  The family’s lawyer, Justin Bamberg, said the family maintains that Scott held a book in his hands and that he did not own a gun.  Police shot Scott, a black man, in Tuesday, but days later the footage has not been released because of a pending law that will require a court order to release such videos. It will take effect in October. In the meantime, thousands of Charlotte residents have angrily called for more transparency from the city’s police, including the release of the video. Bamberg said the family planned to view the footage later in the day. Their response will be critical in a city poised for another night of violent demonstrations. Police have no plans to reveal the footage to the public. Police chief Kerr Putney made that announcement on Thursday morning after a night of violent protests that left property damaged, several people injured and at least one man fighting for his life. Putney told a news conference that the video does show Keith Scott, 43, was holding a gun and not a book, as the family has claimed: “I can tell you we did not find a book. ” But, he said, it does not clearly show Scott pointing the gun at anyone. “Right now my priority is the people who really are the victims of the shooting,” Putney said. “I’m telling you right now if you think I say we should display a victim’s worst day for consumption that is not the transparency I’m speaking of. ” The family’s reaction could be the key to calming  —   or not  —   a city population that has demanded more transparency from police. Mayor Jennifer Roberts told NPR on Thursday morning that releasing the police video “depends on the investigation and its progress, and it depends on the discretion of the chief to some extent”. Roberts said she hoped to watch the video on Thursday or Friday. “I certainly would feel better being able to see it,” she said, adding that she would not know how conclusive the video footage was until she had watched it. Authorities were bringing in outside help to prepare for any further demonstrations on Thursday night. Governor Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency, and began bringing in national guard troops to quell any violence. The chief state prosecutor, Andrew Murray, asked the state bureau of investigation to help examine Scott’s shooting. Violence and confusion spread across Charlotte on Wednesday, a second night of protests that was interrupted by gunfire when one protester shot another. Crowds gathered at the site of the protester’s shooting and pulled clay planters from city flowerbeds to throw at police. Dirt from the pots mixed with the wounded protester’s blood on the sidewalk, trampled by the opposing ranks of police and protesters. Initially city officials said the man had died from the gunfire, but later reversed to say he was alive but critically wounded. Protesters held signs that read “release the tape”. Police shot and killed Scott in the parking lot of an apartment complex where he lived on the east side of the city. The shooting of a protester on Wednesday night took place in an upscale section of Charlotte’s business district called Uptown, and a few protesters looted stores as crowds paced the streets. Robert Noble, 48, and his wife were finishing dinner at a restaurant called City Smoke when they saw a wave of protesters surge past the building’s glass front. “Then a brick came flying through the window,” he said. Staff and patrons evacuated through a back corridor, he said. Police gathered at the intersection where the night’s shooting had happened, divided it into quadrants and marched outward, slowly pressing back protesters. They fired teargas canisters as they moved. Protesters lost, regained and lost territory into the night, and eventually started flinging wine bottles and at least one molotov cocktail at the lines of police. Once protesters threw bottles police started firing orange plastic bullets filled with white powder. The shots  —   which made the sound of automatic gunfire  —   scattered crowds before they gradually reformed. Police wore the   riot gear that has led some to criticize the militarization of law enforcement. But in North Carolina, home to numerous military bases and veterans, police found themselves squaring off more often against former soldiers who had their own tactics and gear. “They’re treating us like we’re in a war zone,” said protester Sage Lawson, 24, of Reidsville, North Carolina. Wednesday was the first anniversary of his leaving the military, he said. “We couldn’t do this to people in Afghanistan. They can snatch people out of a crowd and just throw them in a van. We couldn’t do that in war. ” A man in a gas mask who gave his first name as John but declined to give his last name, said he spent four years in the marines, stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. “I’m still serving my country,” he said, sounding distant and muffled through the mask. He stood just a foot or so from a line of police, who wore their own masks. “It feels strange to be on this side, it does,” he said. “But this is the right thing. ” Amid the flying bottles and canisters and plastic bullets,    Henry Lee sat silent on a lawn chair at the center of the confrontation. He didn’t speak to anyone, but listened to music. As police advanced he moved his chair back incrementally. “I will not run,” he said. The only thing that moved him from his position was a thrown glass bottle. He stood and turned to face a wall of protesters, almost all younger than him. “Cut that out!” he thundered. “Stop throwing shit. There’s a right way to do this. ” And then he sat down again.

Tears and prayers for a tight-knit team as Chapecoense’s fairytale ends in tragedy
The players from Chapecoense were heading for a match that would surely mark the pinnacle of their club’s history so far: the first leg of the final in South America’s Copa Sudamericana  —   the continent’s second most prominent club competition. It was the first time they had made it this far, and was the highlight of a fairytale season, which had already earned them comparisons with Leicester City’s surprise rise to the top of the English Premier League earlier in the year. But instead, the day ended in tragedy. The charter plane carrying 77 people including the team, their coaching staff and 20 journalists travelling to cover the match against Colombian side Atlético Nacional, crashed on a hillside near Medellín, killing 71 people on board. Six people survived the crash. Although most of the team were not household names outside of the southern city of Chapecó, the deaths sent shockwaves around the footballing world. “Brazilian football is in mourning,” said Pelé, the legendary Brazilian striker. “It is such a tragic loss. ” Plínio David de Nes Filho, president of the club’s guiding committee, gave an emotional interview to Brazilian network TV Globo, describing the fraternal atmosphere at the club. “Lifelong friends were on that flight. It was not just a group founded on mutual respect it was a family,” he said.  “I said goodbye to them and they told me they were going after the dream, turning that dream into reality. The dream was over early this morning. ” Among the victims was    striker Thiaguinho, who had just a week earlier found out he was due to be a father for the first time. In a video released by his family after the crash, Thiaguinho is seen dancing and celebrating the news with his  . The club’s goalkeeper, Danilo, who initially survived the crash after he was dragged from the wreckage, died shortly after calling his wife from hospital, according to local reports. GloboEsporte reported a surge of votes for the     —   perhaps the side’s standout player  —   in its public Player of the Year poll. The club had been playing in Brazil’s fourth division until 2009 and won promotion to the country’s top league in 2014 for the first time since the 1970s. They had already secured their highest finish in the top flight before the tragedy occurred. A video posted on Chapecoense’s Facebook account showed the team checking in at Guarulhos airport in São Paulo before two of the players are seen on the plane, flashing victory signs and saying “We’ll be arriving in Colombia soon. ” The club’s manager, Luiz Carlos Saroli, usually called Caio Júnior died in the crash. His son, Matheus Saroli, had been scheduled to fly with the team but was unable to leave because he had left his passport at home. “We need strength and I ask that you give us a little privacy, especially my mother,” he wrote on Facebook. “We are strong. We are going to get past this. Thank you everyone. ” The Chapecoense player Alejandro Martinuccio was also absent from the trip to Medellín because of an injury. Speaking to Argentina’s La Red radio, the    winger said: “I was saved because I got injured. ” He said: “I feel profound sadness   …     The only thing I can ask is prayers for the companions who were on the flight. ” The family of the striker Bruno Rangel gathered in Campos, in Rio de Janeiro state, to await news. “He is the pride of the city,” Maurício da Horta, a friend of the forward, told GloboEsporte. Among the backroom staff on the flight was physio Anderson Paixão, whose father Paulo was part of the Brazil national team   under manager Luiz Felipe Scolari. “He’d been with Chapecoense since they were in Série C,” said Paixão Sr. “Like everyone at the club, he was experiencing a magical moment. He was so happy. Now he’s up there. ” A number of Brazil’s biggest sides jointly released a statement in which they put forward “solidarity measures” to help the club’s survival in the top flight. These included a suggestion of free player loans in 2017 and a formal request to the country’s football federation that Chape be granted an exemption from relegation for the next three seasons. “This is a very, very sad day for football,” the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, said in a statement. “At this difficult time our thoughts are with the victims, their families and friends. Fifa would like to extend its most heartfelt condolences to the fans of Chapecoense, the football community and media organizations concerned in Brazil. ”

The Republicans tried to sink Obama. Instead, the party imploded
It may seem too early to call, but we already have a winner in the 2016 election. He’s someone the pundits wrote off long ago. An improbable outsider who rode an insurgent wave to snatch the nomination from the establishment. An unconventional politician whose raucous rallies underscored his appeal to voters far outside his party base. His name is Barack Obama. And he can thank the freak show that is Donald Trump’s Republican party for restoring his stature as a unifying, national leader with a moderated and mature approach to a complex and unstable world. Eight years ago, Obama represented an existential threat to the Republican party, and not just because he was going to lead the Democratic party to win the White House and Congress by large margins. No, Obama’s biggest threat was that he could realign American politics, shifting it fundamentally towards progressives for a generation. He and his campaign aides talked privately of being the Reagan of the left: a transformative figure who would leave an indelible legislative mark at home and restore America’s position on the world stage. With his appeal to independents and moderate Republicans, Obama could break the Republican party as a national force. With his appeal to minority voters  —   a rapidly emerging majority across the country  —   he could lock in the fastest growing demographics that could turn red states blue. So the GOP leadership chose to make Obama unacceptable, unpalatable and  . On the night of his first inauguration, House Republican leaders met at a Washington steakhouse to plot their path back to power. They would not reform their policies or consider the root cause of their defeat. Instead, they would oppose Obama on everything, well before he tried to pass a giant stimulus bill or healthcare reform. They needed to deny him a reputation for bipartisanship and mainstream politics, and they succeeded. He wasn’t reasonable he was an ideologue. His vision of healthcare reform wasn’t a   system based on Republican plans it was a socialist takeover that would destroy the American way of life. He was inviting terrorist attacks on the homeland, not hunting down Osama bin Laden. He was acting in unconstitutional ways because he wasn’t really American at all. The party of Sarah Palin, Herman Cain, Michele Bachmann and Roger Ailes had turned him into their own kind of freak. Before he finished his second year in office, Obama was such an object of Republican loathing that the Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell could say  —   with impunity  —   that “the single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a   president. ” If your political priorities are the total defeat of a single politician  —   not the advancement of your own policies through debate or legislation  —   then you are already in pretty desperate shape. You render it impossible to compromise with your opponents, and you fan the flames of extremism that will burn anyone in the center. You also look weak and foolish when you lose, surrendering the stage to someone who can vilify his opponents better than you. So don’t look dazed and confused at Donald Trump when he runs your playbook more convincingly than your own team. It’s too late to fret about endorsing his kooky positions  —   like deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, treating all Muslims as enemies and blowing up the deficit  —   when they are only logical extensions of your own. After eight years of conservative caricature, you may be forgiven for thinking that Obama is a Kenyan Muslim socialist with terrorist sympathies and   policies on healthcare and bank regulation. Of course, if you live inside the echo chamber of Fox News and rightwing talk radio, you have to ignore the pesky fact that unemployment now stands at 4. 9%. That’s lower than when Reagan left office in 1988, and it’s lower than when Bill Clinton won   in 1996. The rate stood at 8. 3% in Obama’s first full month in office, and not much below that when he won  . For a president with a   economic plan, that’s not a shabby performance. Sure enough, Obama’s approval ratings (52%) are almost identical to Reagan’s in August 1988 (53%) and a dramatic contrast to those of George W Bush (32%) in 2008. One of these Republican presidents was succeeded by his own   the other was succeeded by Barack Obama. This should lead to some serious   inside the Republican party. Not a   about how to reach out to Latino voters, but a dismantling of the politics of personal destruction, and the creation of a new, hopeful agenda that can appeal to the mainstream. Instead, the only point of unity inside the GOP is its gleeful hatred of Hillary Clinton, and its thinly veiled disdain for a nominee who has yet to find a politician he can’t insult. The Republican party did not entirely fail to destroy Barack Obama. For a few years, aided by the great recession, they almost succeeded. But then they contrived to revive him by nominating a man who would destroy everything Obama stood for, along with much of the free world as we know it. The rise of Trump has led, perversely, to the revival of Obama. Republican candidates are saying they will not vote for their presidential nominee, and the party’s national security officials are lining up to condemn Trump as a reckless danger to the Republic. How could the incumbent not look like a statesman compared to a man who apparently can’t be trusted with the elevator button, never mind a nuclear one? Inside the White House, Obama’s aides talk about a president liberated from previous constraint. On the trail, and at the podium, he seems to love campaigning against his orange nemesis. His party’s candidates can’t get enough of him, and his potential successor  —   instead of putting distance between them  —   believes Obama doesn’t get enough credit for his economic achievements. This   president is having an unusually successful end to his second term, and for that he can thank the Republicans who were so determined to destroy him.

What a difference a year makes: Donald Trump tailors message to evangelicals
Practice may not make perfect for Donald Trump but the Republican nominee has clearly refined his appeal to evangelical voters in the past year. One year after Trump was booed at the conservative Values Voters Summit for calling Marco Rubio “a clown” the Republican nominee gave a more polished speech where he ignored politically divisive issues like abortion and   marriage and instead focused on school vouchers and changing federal law to allow tax exempt churches to engage in political advocacy.  For Trump, school choice, which he advocated in a speech on Thursday, was a needed innovation. “The education can’t get worse,” he said while also pledging to “campaign to get the states to reallocate another $110bn of their education budgets to school choice programs”. Speaking from teleprompters, it served as a pointed contrast to his speech a year ago which seemed to focus on the importance of saying “Merry Christmas” instead of “Happy Holidays”. This year, Trump was still not a natural in front of a crowd of ardent social conservatives, even once referring to attendees as “you people”. Trump also railed against the Obama administration for not admitting Christian refugees from Syria into the United States, a major cause of concern for evangelicals Christians who have long advocated for minority Christian communities in the Middle East. Not mentioned was Trump’s own refugee policy, which would be a blanket ban on anyone from the region entering the United States.  Trump did seem to recognize that no one would mistake him for a devout evangelical. At one point in the speech he joked that his support for repealing the Johnson amendment, which would allow churches to engage in partisan politics while keeping their   status, was the only way he could get into heaven. But the biggest applause was not for Trump himself but for when he proclaimed: “Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president. ” The room exploded in applause and one attendee could be seen waving his tricorne hat in support. The Values Voter Summit is sponsored by the Family Research Council and has a constellation of conservative groups represented. Even the   John Birch Society had a table in the group’s exhibition hall. But Trump’s performance seemed to ease the concerns of attendees who represented some of the most ardent cultural warriors in the party, a group that has long been uncomfortable with the party’s nominee, and preferred other candidates like Ted Cruz during the primary.  Dylan Miller, a rising community college freshman from   Florida said the speech changed his mind about Trump.  “He doesn’t seem maniacal” the teenager said, contrasting Friday’s speech to the Republican nominee’s frequent televised performances. Miller had said he had always planned on voting for Trump “because he wasn’t Hillary” but Trump’s performance made him feel far more comfortable with his vote.  Another attendee, Sarah Ocker, a student at Tulsa Community College in Oklahoma, said she was closer to voting for Trump after his speech. She said that she “agreed with a lot” of what Trump said, particularly about “religious liberty”. But Ocker still had major hesitations about Trump and couldn’t commit to voting for him, although she was “hoping” she could find a reason to do soby November. Vernon Lewis of Marshall, Texas, was further along in the process.  Lewis had once thought he would have to hold his nose to vote for Trump, but after Trump granted him and other Christians a private meeting in New York, as well as seeing his speech on Friday, Lewis said he was enthusiastic. “He is a very gentle guy. ”

WHO recommends safe sex for people returning from Zika-affected zones
The World Health Organisation has said that men and women returning from areas in which the Zika virus is actively spreading should practise safer sex or abstinence for six months, regardless of whether they are trying to conceive or showing symptoms.  The guidance is a change from WHO’s interim recommendation on 7 June, which referred only to men and had a shorter timeframe of at least eight weeks. WHO said the update was based on new evidence of Zika transmission from asymptomatic males to their female partners and a symptomatic female to her male partner, as well as evidence that Zika is present in semen for longer than thought.  Zika infections in pregnant women have been shown to cause microcephaly  —   a severe birth defect in which the head and brain are undersized  —   as well as other brain abnormalities. The connection between Zika and microcephaly first came to light last autumn in Brazil, which has since confirmed more than 1, 800 cases of microcephaly. In adults, Zika infections have also been linked to a rare neurological syndrome known as   as well as other neurological disorders.  Sexual transmission of Zika had been reported in 11 countries by 26 August, mainly through vaginal intercourse. There was the first documented case of a man catching the virus through anal sex in February 2016 and a suspicion of Zika transmission through oral sex in April.  Although one man had Zika found in his semen 188 days after the onset of symptoms, the longest period that the virus has so far been found to remain infectious was 24 days, and WHO said its latest   advice was conservative. In another Zika sufferer, the concentration of the virus in his semen was 100, 000 more than that in his blood 14 days after he was diagnosed.  Evidence on persistence of the virus in semen and its infectiousness and impact on sexual transmission remains limited and the guidance will be updated again when there is more information, WHO said.  WHO advises that pregnant women should not travel to areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission, and it warned people travelling to the Paralympic Games, which starts on Wednesday in Rio de Janeiro, to take precautions against mosquito bites. “We think that the risk for travellers and athletes is low, but it’s not zero,” said WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic.

Asos must pay £20m to rival retailers
Online fashion retailer Asos has been forced to pay out more than £20m to two European retailers due to an alleged infringement of the trademarks on their names. Asos has reached a global settlement with Assos of Switzerland, which makes clothing for cyclists, and Anson’s Herrenhaus, a German menswear retailer. The UK retailer will pay a total of £20. 2m in cash to the two companies. The deal will allow Asos to start selling athletic leisurewear, a growing segment of the youth fashion market. However, Asos will be restricted from selling cyclewear and opening shops in Germany. Assos and Anson’s were already both in operation when Asos changed its name from As Seen on Screen in 2002. Anson’s launched its legal case in 2010 and Assos launched its in 2011 as Asos began to expand rapidly outside the UK. Assos will open it first flagship store outside Switzerland in London’s West End later this year. Asos had successfully defended its case in the UK right up to the supreme court. However, there are outstanding cases in the US, France and Germany. Despite the payment, which is equal to almost six months profit for Asos, shares in the company rose 132p, or 3% to £46. 94. Nick Beighton, chief executive of Asos, said: “We are pleased to have put this litigation behind us. Entering into this settlement at this juncture is the right commercial decision for our business. ” Asos has been involved in disputes with rival retailers before over trademark infringements, but they have tended to involve accusations that the online retailer stole the design of an individual piece of clothing. The company said there were no other intellectual property cases that could have a material impact on its finances. Analysts at Berenberg said: “Intellectual property law is very complex and varies significantly by country. Asos couldn’t therefore guarantee that it would win all cases in all markets and as such decided to settle the disputes. ” The City welcomed the settlement because of the potential disruption the legal cases could have caused and the new opportunities that could open up for Asos. Simon Bowler, analyst at Exane, added: “Whilst Asos has successfully defended itself until now, there was no certainty they would be successful in these markets. Losing a case in either of these markets would force Asos to rebrand, which was a significant risk that Asos has eliminated. “Whilst the £20. 2m cash payment is optically large, this looks to be the right commercial decision for the business in the long term. The settlement brings certainty over the end of the dispute and eliminates any further litigation risk in Asos’s biggest markets. The settlement also opens up the opportunity of moving the Asos   into the attractive ‘athleisure’ market. ” Analysts at RBC Capital Markets said: “In addition to removing a potentially large distraction, Asos will now be permitted to start selling sportswear on a global basis which they were previously unable to whilst the litigation was under way. “Sportswear, particularly yoga wear, gym wear, golf wear, could present a sizeable market share opportunity for Asos given its younger customer demographic and the growth we have been seeing in the premium sportswear market. ”

The inside story of Facebook’s biggest setback
Until Mark Zuckerberg arrived in a bright orange helicopter in October 2014, Chandauli had never seen a celebrity visitor. One of 44, 795 villages in the state of Rajasthan, Chandauli is only three or four hours’ drive from Delhi, but it exists alone and forgotten, tucked away, a kilometre off a quiet highway. Last year, when a local boy used the internet to buy a used motorcycle, astonished villagers called him an online shopping hero. Zuckerberg had come to see an experiment at work. Earlier that year, with its sights set on the forthcoming elections, the government had asked a foundation to help give Chandauli’s mostly Muslim villagers a digital education. And so, with uncommon haste, a small administrative building was turned into a community centre, where locals could learn how to access email and find information online. Soon, almost every household in the village had one person who knew how to use a computer. The digital transformation of Chandauli was an ideal story for Zuckerberg  —   a little parable for his grand mission for India. He wanted to bring the internet to millions of people who had never used it before. Specifically, he wanted to bring them a version of the internet that had Facebook at its core. After Zuckerberg landed, he was quickly guided by his advisers towards the community centre. He saw wheat fields and power lines, and a classroom with children sitting on a dirt floor. The heat warped the horizon. A crowd trailed behind him, talking excitedly about the man they called “Juckerberg”. But once he stepped inside the centre, the door was closed and latched. Zuckerberg took a seat on a plastic stool, and awkwardly asked the village children about how they used the centre’s computers. His stiff manner, combined with the presence of a reporter from Time magazine, and a Facebook photographer documenting the encounter, added to the sensation that the locals were playing parts in a performance directed by the company. But not everything went according to plan. The electricity had gone out shortly after Zuckerberg arrived, taking with it the wireless network that provided the village’s main connection to the internet. Instead, one of the boys showed Zuckerberg his mobile phone, and tried to bring up his Facebook profile page. This roused the CEO. “He genuinely wanted to know what they did on their phones, and how they spent time on the internet,” said Osama Manzar, the   of the Digital Empowerment Foundation that had set up Chandauli’s digital literacy centre. Under Zuckerberg’s gaze, the boy’s profile page slowly emerged on a 2G connection. “Bandwidth issues,” Zuckerberg said to himself. He assured the children inside, and the villagers outside, that their connectivity problems would be fixed before his next visit. Later that day, Zuckerberg returned to New Delhi, where he posted a picture of himself speaking with a child at the resource centre. “Seeing   how people here are using the internet was an incredible experience,” he wrote. “One day, if we can connect every village, we can transform many more lives and improve the world for all of us. Chandauli is just the start. ” From Zuckerberg’s vantage point, high above the connected world he had helped create, India was a largely blank map. Many of its citizens  —   hundreds of millions of people  —   were clueless about the internet’s powers. If only they could see how easily they could form a community, how quickly they could turn into buyers and sellers of anything, how effortlessly they could find anything they needed  —   and so much more that they didn’t. Zuckerberg was convinced that Facebook could win them over, and even more convinced that this would change their lives for the better. He would bring India’s rural poor online quickly, and in great numbers, with an irresistible proposition: users would pay nothing at all to access a version of the internet curated by Facebook. But where Zuckerberg saw the endless promise of a digital future, Indians came to see something more sinister. Seventeen months later, Facebook’s grand plans to bring India online had been halted by overwhelming local opposition  —   the biggest stumbling block the company had hit in its   . In the end, it seemed, Facebook had acted as if it was giving India a gift. But it was not a gift Indians wanted. In the charged days before Facebook went public in May 2012, its official filings contained a faint warning about the company’s future growth. In Europe and America, the company had gained users at an astonishing rate  —   but, as it ran out of new people to add, its expansion was slowing. On both continents, almost four out of five people had internet access, and more than half of them were already on Facebook. In the rest of the world, Facebook’s business was booming, but it had the opposite problem: less than half the population was connected to the internet. For the social network to continue its astronomical growth, it needed those people to get online. No country except China held the kind of potential that India did  —   and Facebook was banned in China. Without much effort, there were already around 100 million Facebook users in India by 2014, and the company judged its potential market to be several hundred million more. “If you look at the literate population, which is a good proxy for how many people can be online, it’s about   million,” a Facebook employee who worked on the company’s plans for India told me. “That’s really the opportunity. If you rank countries based on opportunity, India comes out on top, and comes out on top by a big margin. ” According to a Facebook executive, the company’s internal analysis projected that more than 30% of the new customers it hoped to add worldwide by 2020 would come from India. But Facebook was not about to sit around waiting for them to get online on their own. Since 2010, the company had been experimenting with ways to bring more people online, and thus to Facebook. One of these experiments, the Facebook employee said, was a project referred to as Apollo. Under Apollo, Facebook’s growth and partnership teams persuaded mobile phone companies in the Philippines, Latin America, Africa and India to give mobile phone users who had not paid for data plans free access to Facebook. The initial financial sacrifice, Facebook told the phone companies, was an investment  —   giving customers a small taste of the internet would convince them to start paying to access everything the web had to offer. The best proof of this proposition came in the Philippines, where Facebook partnered with Globe  —   the smaller of the country’s two dominant mobile companies  —   which trailed its rival’s market share by 20 percentage points. Globe’s user numbers surged, and within 15 months, it had overtaken its rival, thanks to the enormous lure of free access to Facebook. “It all started with the free Facebook promo,” one Filipino stock analyst told a local business newspaper. The success of such experiments fed into a much bigger plan Facebook had been developing: an ambitious effort to bring hundreds of millions of people around the world online. In February 2014, while the results of the Philippines experiment were trickling in, Zuckerberg stood on a stage at a mobile industry conference in Barcelona and pitched the phone companies its big plan: Internet. org, which would provide free basic internet services to entice the whole world online. The phone companies would foot the bill, but Zuckerberg laid out the economic benefits of helping the world’s poor to join the digital age: “There was this Deloitte study that came out the other day,” he told his audience, “that said if you could connect everyone in emerging markets, you could create more than 100 million jobs and bring a lot of people out of poverty. ” The Deloitte study, which did indeed say this, was commissioned by Facebook, based on data provided by Facebook, and was about Facebook. In July 2014, Zambia became the first country where Internet. org was rolled out. But Facebook was already preparing for India. A few months before Zuckerberg’s helicopter landed in Chandauli, Facebook contacted Osama Manzar of the Digital Empowerment Foundation to ask for his advice on tailoring Internet. org to a local audience. Manzar is stocky, with a face that expresses delight instantly. In a room full of dark suits, he is the guy wearing the white kurta and the patterned turban. For months, Facebook employees working on Internet. org mined Manzar for information. “Just about anybody from Facebook in the US would land up at our office,” he told me. Facebook staff emailed and phoned him. “They had questions interns would have!” Manzar likes to say he guided them like a paid adviser, but without the pay. “It was taking a lot out of me, and I had no idea what the future of this huge amount of   was,” he told me. Manzar, who is 48, had spent much of his life working to help Indians get online, and now one of the biggest tech companies in the world had thrown its weight behind his cause. “The power of Facebook as a platform, how it has motivated people to come online, generate content, get even the   to become literate . .. I am a great fan,” he said. But Manzar’s optimism soured when he saw what Internet. org actually looked like: a threadbare platform that only allowed access to 36 bookmarked sites and Facebook, which was naturally the only social network available. There was one weather app, three sites for women’s issues, and the search engine Bing. Facebook’s   internet was reminiscent of old search engines that listed the early web on one page, when it was small enough to be categorised, like books in a library. Crucially, Facebook itself would decide which sites were included on the platform. The company had positioned Internet. org as a philanthropic endeavour  —   backed by Zuckerberg’s lofty pronouncements that “connectivity is a human right”  —   but retained total control of the platform. “Their pitch about access turned into mobilisation for their own product,” Manzar said. Manzar had never seen anything like it. He realised that if Internet. org took hold in India, Facebook would be the gatekeeper to the web for hundreds of millions who had no idea what the internet was, or what it could do for them. As Zuckerberg travelled around the country in the autumn of 2014, he had every reason to be optimistic about Facebook’s India strategy. He received an ecstatically warm welcome from Indian politicians, who were eager to advertise their   by being seen with Facebook’s founder. He was even granted an audience with India’s new prime minister, Narendra Modi, who had built a sizeable online presence  —   with some help from Facebook  —   during the recent elections. The prime minister spoke with Zuckerberg about his “Clean India” mission  —   which encouraged citizens to tidy up their streets and towns  —   and Zuckerberg said Facebook would create an app for the programme. (This promise was widely reported, but the app never materialised. When employees inquired about it later, a senior Facebook policy director said that making the app would violate Facebook’s   policies, according to documentation I was shown.) Zuckerberg also got an easy ride from the Indian media, which churned out puff pieces about Facebook’s noble plans to get millions of Indians online. But the company remained vague about the detailed workings of Internet. org, and tech journalists began to voice their suspicions after an evasive press conference in New Delhi, where Zuckerberg only took questions from carefully selected reporters. One of the sceptics was Nikhil Pahwa, the founder and editor of Medianama, a news site about India’s telecommunications industry, who left the press conference and began to outline his reservations about what Facebook was proposing. “What Zuckerberg means by internet for all, is essentially Facebook for all, along with a few   services thrown in to give it the appearance of philanthropy,” he wrote the following day. But what would prove devastating to Zuckerberg’s ambitions for India was something else that Pahwa noticed. Facebook had wandered into an arcane technical dispute  —   involving India’s phone companies and the idea of net neutrality  —   which was about to come to a boil. Internet. org would allow some commercial services  —   such as the employment site Babajob  —   to be available on its free platform. But that would necessarily mean excluding those companies’ competitors, and essentially subsidising the growth of a few chosen firms. Pahwa argued that this arrangement violated net neutrality  —   the principle that phone companies and internet providers should not be allowed to prioritise certain sites and services, since this could fundamentally alter the level playing field of the internet. The government had been debating the legality of services said to violate net neutrality. If it decided to issue a ruling on the subject, Facebook’s plans could be dashed. Medianama, Pahwa’s website, was not widely read outside of the telecoms industry, but he was a respected voice in the field, and Facebook was sufficiently concerned about his criticism that the company invited him for a meeting in January 2015. Two senior officials were in the office: Ankhi Das, Facebook’s head of public policy in India, and Kevin Martin, the former chairman of the US Federal Communications Commission, who was working as a consultant for the company. Pahwa was unwilling to speak about the meeting (“It was off the record,” he explained) but he said that “the sense I had was that Facebook was trying to understand how much I knew about Internet. org”. In February 2015, four months after Zuckerberg’s visit, Internet. org went live in India, in partnership with Reliance Mobile, India’s   phone company. (Several other operators declined, the Facebook employee told me, because they were already worried about the issue of net neutrality.) Reliance’s advertisements for the service showed college students crowding around a single phone, laughing at something on the screen. The tagline: “If the sun is free   …     If the air is free   …     Then why shouldn’t the internet be free?” For a brief moment, it felt like a routine product launch  —   except for continued complaints from a small number of critics. Facebook responded to criticism by claiming that 40% of users were purchasing full data plans within a month  —   joining the full internet, in other words  —   but the critics fired back that as Facebook refused to provide further details these numbers could not be verified. The debate between the company and its critics about the virtues of Internet. org would most likely have carried on quietly, without ever disturbing the attention of ordinary Indians. But at the end of March 2015, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) announced that it was considering a ruling on net neutrality, and asked for public comment on the issue. Any ruling would affect the fate of Internet. org. For Pahwa, this was a worrying development. Even the term “net neutrality” was forbidding: “It’s a terrible, technical sounding phrase,” he said. The TRAI already seemed to have a tendency to come down on the side of the phone companies, and Pahwa believed his only chance of winning was to somehow gather huge public support. The regulator could ignore policy papers by telecom nerds. “What they can’t ignore is people,” Pahwa emailed a friend. Luckily, at least in the public eye, his adversary was one of the world’s largest and most famous technology companies  —   and the playing field was a country whose citizens reacted with fierce antipathy to anything that looked like a foreign power dictating terms to grateful supplicants. Pahwa fired off emails to several acquaintances, explaining that he felt the future of India’s internet was at stake. “People don’t realise what’s going on until it has happened,” he said. A group of volunteers  —   coders, lawyers, policy wonks  —   began to coalesce around Pahwa. Dubbing their movement Save the Internet, they built a website that would allow anyone to make a submission to the regulator in favour of net neutrality. On 11 April, the website launched, featuring a video by a wildly popular group of young comedians, All India Bakchod  —   who produced a   net neutrality explainer that would eventually rack up 3. 5 million views. Within two weeks, more than a million people had used the site to send emails to the government  —   and soon enough, politicians were debating net neutrality in parliament. All of a sudden, a shockingly large number of Indians had been drawn into a loud and raucous public argument about the intricacies of the country’s telecoms policy. On one side, there was the unlikely sight of a popular online rebellion, among young and old alike, in favour of net neutrality  —   a concept almost nobody had heard of a few months earlier. On the other side were the phone companies and Facebook, which was convinced that its plans would benefit the economy, lure a massive invisible population online, and help realise India’s ambitions to become a digital powerhouse. This side was not without its own impassioned supporters, and soon India’s fractious social media was tangled in thousands of bitter fights about whether Facebook was asking too much for the kind of progress it promised to provide. On Twitter, supporters of net neutrality began to protest against companies that had partnered with Facebook. Before long, four websites withdrew their participation, and tweeted support for net neutrality on their way out. All the while, from his office at Facebook HQ in Silicon Valley, Chris Daniels, the   of Internet. org, watched with alarm as the opposition mounted in India. In particular, I was told by a person close to Daniels, the popularity of All India Bakchod’s video worried Facebook’s top brass. The company’s most senior leaders in India scrambled to assemble a response: according to a Facebook employee, their only idea was to “address myths” about Internet. org and “educate” policymakers about the platform. “Just answering their questions was the strategy,” the employee recalled. To most onlookers, Facebook’s initial reaction suggested that the company was not taking the opposition seriously. Its efforts appeared clumsy and ineffective, especially for a company that rarely stumbles so visibly. Employees wondered what Facebook’s gameplan was. “To do things right, you need someone in policy who is a strategist and a skilful tactician,” the Facebook employee said. “Globally, yes, we have people like that. In India I’m not so sure. ” In private, Facebook’s efforts began to intensify. Zuckerberg began to make personal calls to Indian internet entrepreneurs to rebuild support for Internet. org. One person he contacted was a former senior executive of NASSCOM, India’s software industry lobby. The senior executive told Zuckerberg that he would support Internet. org  —   but only if Facebook opened up the platform to any company that wanted to participate. Zuckerberg promised him Facebook would make this change in the future. “Can we have your support now?” the executive recalled Zuckerberg asking. “We’ll make it a feature in Internet. org 2. 0. ” Over the course of 2015, Facebook executives repeatedly met with lawmakers and the government’s regulators, who gave no indication when they would issue any decision on net neutrality. (In response to my questions, a Facebook spokesperson said the company had met with the chairman of India’s telecoms regulator to discuss “a range of connectivity issues”.) Daniels, the Internet. org   made about six trips to India in 2015 to meet with policymakers, the Facebook employee recalled: “Those meetings were like a rollercoaster. Sometimes it would feel like lawmakers and regulators understood what Facebook was trying to do with Internet. org, and in some meetings somebody would make it sound like we would get shut down tomorrow. ” Facebook held its cards close, and tried to avoid public confrontation. At one parliamentary committee hearing, the company took the unusual step of asking if it could put its case to lawmakers in private, and had everyone else cleared out of the room. Ankhi Das, the company’s head of public policy  —   its top lobbyist, in other words  —   had uncommonly good access in Delhi’s corridors of power. Her presence seemed to open any door, a Facebook executive told me. “We used to joke that it was like she was Modi’s granddaughter. ” Modi had swept into office after a massive election victory in May 2014, thanks in part to a huge,   online following. The person who ran Modi’s social media operation told me that Facebook was extraordinarily responsive to requests from the campaign, and recalled that Das “never said no” to any information the campaign wanted. However, a Facebook spokesperson insisted that the company had never provided special information or extra details to Modi’s campaign. In the months after the election, Facebook’s interest in India was evident. Sheryl Sandberg met Modi soon after. A few months later, Zuckerberg paid him a visit. And in the midst of the net neutrality debate, Modi returned the favour by making an appearance before a large crowd at Facebook’s Menlo Park headquarters in September 2015, with Zuckerberg and Sandberg at his side. The moment  —   a picture of solidarity  —   was broadcast live online, and did not go unnoticed back in India, where it was covered live on television. Pahwa, who had been invited into a TV studio to give his reaction, recalled that he feared Modi would announce his opposition to net neutrality on the spot. Instead, Zuckerberg told Modi a cute story. “I haven’t told this publicly,” he began, anxiously. “Before things were going well, when people wanted to buy Facebook, I met my mentor, Steve Jobs. ” The Apple CEO apparently urged Zuckerberg to visit a temple in India that he had gone to years earlier. “So I travelled for almost a month, seeing how people connected,” said Zuckerberg. “Having the opportunity to feel how much better the world could be if everyone had a stronger ability to connect reinforced for me the importance of what we were doing. That’s something I’ve always remembered while we built Facebook. ” Modi clapped and grinned. A month after Modi’s visit to Silicon Valley, Zuckerberg returned to Delhi once again. At the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi, Zuckerberg sauntered on to a stage and gave woolly answers to the softest of   questions. But when the talk ended, Zuckerberg was ushered to a nearby room, where many of India’s most prominent online entrepreneurs had been assembled for a   meeting with him. By now Internet. org had been rechristened Free Basics. The meeting was about how Facebook could help everyone there, one of the attendees recalled. However, the entrepreneurs wanted to talk about Free Basics. “Everybody started saying, ‘Well, why are you controlling who gets on this? ’” recalled Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the proprietor of the popular mobile payments firm Paytm. Zuckerberg assured them that Facebook would no longer retain the power to choose which sites were included. “He said he will not decide who will be on Free Basics. Some ‘eminent people’ of India will decide,” Sharma said. The entrepreneurs wanted Free Basics changed in many ways, and Sharma recalled Zuckerberg’s response as being, “I’ve heard your inputs, and we’ll try changing it. ” When it was Sharma’s turn to speak, he did not hide his feelings. “I said, ‘Zuck, what are you talking about?’ In my view, it’s like the British coming in and saying, ‘While everything’s OK, we’ll come in and help you with your tax collection  —   and this is the percentage we’ll take.’ It’s incredible. ” Several people involved in the debate over net neutrality shared Sharma’s disbelief. They told me that Facebook’s insistence on pushing through Free Basics without a transparent discussion was doing lasting damage to the company. “There was   in the people who carried out the campaign,” Nitin Pai, the   of an influential policy thinktank named the Takshashila Institution, told me. “You know that foreigners talking down to Indians and telling them what is good for them is going to backfire. ” Zuckerberg had tried to gain Sharma’s support. An endorsement by the boss of Paytm  —   one of India’s entrepreneurship success stories  —   would have been a signal to other companies to sign on, said the former NASSCOM executive. But Sharma had been consistent in his opposition to platforms like Free Basics. “What is my perception of Facebook’s purpose? Thumbs up,” Sharma said when we met earlier this year at his office. “What is my judgment of their actions? It’s not correct. The purpose is nice. I want everybody in this country to be connected as much as Zuck wants. Who doesn’t want that? But are they doing it correctly?” He could not stop laughing as he imagined Facebook’s plans to serve India. “Someone isn’t advising them well. Let them provide the complete internet for free at night. We’ll partner with them,” he said, thumping his chest. Within Facebook, the executive said, there existed a strong belief that the crises would pass the regulator would eventually be pressed to give services such as Free Basics legal sanction and that would end the debate. After months of   the telecoms regulator  —   under the influence of a new chairman  —   decided in November 2015 to hurry up and reach a decision on net neutrality. For the second time in a year, it asked the public to comment, on three specific questions relating to net neutrality and expanding internet access, with a deadline of 30 December. There was no mention of Facebook or Free Basics. “Facebook did not figure much in the discussions,” a person involved in the telecoms regulator’s deliberations said. Instead, the regulator turned the debate’s glare away from Facebook, and on to the larger subject of net neutrality. By resolving the larger issue, they thought, the Free Basics question would sort itself out. But Facebook panicked. The company saw the regulator’s public questions as an existential threat, and within a week, Facebook’s marketing and policy teams launched a   campaign to rally support. Every user in India who logged into Facebook was greeted with a special message from Facebook, which said: “Free Basics is a first step to connecting 1 billion Indians to the opportunities online. But without your support, it could be banned in a matter of weeks. ” Below the message, a large purple button invited users to click and “send email” to the regulator. If this was not intrusive enough, many users complained that even if they declined to send the message, merely lingering on the page caused Facebook to send all their friends a notification indicating they had written to the regulator. Online, outrage at the   tactics erupted. “FB just listed an uncle’s account as having signed up to support Free Basics,” one user tweeted. “He passed away two years ago. ” Facebook had succeeded, overwhelmingly, in making the larger ruling on net neutrality about itself. As Pahwa told me: “Facebook came and shoved its ass in our faces. ” Commuters on India’s roads and highways found themselves called upon to support Free Basics from what seemed like thousands of billboards. One pictured a farmer and his family and asked them to support “a better future” for unconnected Indians such as “Ganesh” who used Free Basics and learned “new farming techniques that doubled his crop yield”. Patriotic Facebook advertisements filled entire pages in Indian newspapers every day. By the end of the year, the Indian business daily Mint reported that Facebook had spent more than £30m on advertising. “It felt like a tidal wave,” Pahwa recalled. Two days before the deadline set by the regulator, an editorial by Zuckerberg was published in the Times of India, the country’s largest newspaper. “Critics of free basic internet services should remember that everything we’re doing is about serving people like Ganesh,” he wrote, in reference to the farmer who had featured in Facebook’s ad campaign. Pahwa responded with an   of his own in the same paper. Behind the scenes, Zuckerberg made one final offer to India’s software industry. NASSCOM, the software lobby, had come out for net neutrality earlier in the year. But now, days before the deadline, its members were abuzz about the deal Zuckerberg had proposed  —   the lobby group itself would hold the power to decide which sites were on Facebook’s platform. “That suddenly made them say, ‘Man, that would put us in a very powerful position,’” the former NASSCOM executive told me. The software lobby quietly changed its tune: it told the regulator it supported net neutrality, with an exception for “  business promotions”  —   like Free Basics. According to Facebook, 16 million users in India sent messages to the regulator to support Free Basics before the deadline. Swamped with feedback, the regulator used   programs to sift out the original replies. A pattern emerged immediately the comments in support of Free Basics that Facebook had submitted did not address the questions the regulators had asked. The regulator worried that Free Basics’ supporters were not “making informed decisions” and chastised Facebook for reducing the consultation to a popularity contest. The regulator spent the month of January 2016 preparing its ruling. The meetings ran on for hours every day. But the discussions were about the details of a stance that had already been decided: net neutrality would be upheld. “We could have kept going on discussing it, but someone has got to stop,” a person closely involved in the process said. “So we just stopped on 8 February. ” Services such as Free Basics were effectively declared illegal. Many of Facebook’s supporters  —   in India and abroad  —   were aghast: why would a poor country reject the assistance of one of the world’s biggest and most powerful tech companies? Marc Andreessen, the powerful venture capitalist who sits on Facebook’s board, contemptuously suggested a misguided resentment of the west was to blame. “  has been economically catastrophic for India for decades,” he told his 500, 000 Twitter followers. “Why stop now?” When I mentioned this quote to the Facebook executive, he raised his voice in frustration. “There’s no respect, and you can see that from Marc Andreessen. They wouldn’t dare to say that about China. In India they’re fine because we’ve been bending over backwards to accommodate them. I’m a supporter of prime minister Modi, but I don’t know why he has let this go on. ” He bet me that Andreessen would apologise by the end of the next day. As we spoke, Andreessen tweeted an apology. Senior people at Facebook, the executive said, had convinced themselves they had special pull with the prime minister. “They believed Modi would do it for them,” he said, recalling meetings where people discussed the similarities in “managing” India and Africa: “It worked in Burundi, so it should work in India. ” “I think the mistake that people make is that they think, ‘India is this developing country and there are these   ways of getting things done,’” the Facebook employee told me. “In essence, the mistake of thinking that a   country is a banana republic. So institutions, the public, the press  —   they can be bypassed. ” He recalled a whiff of disrespect that lingered in meeting rooms and on conference calls. “You can sense it in the way that some of these things have been approached. It’s like, ‘If we show support for Free Basics from six million users, the government can’t shut it down’. ” “We are not a Tanzania,” Pai, the thinktank founder, said. “We are producing apps, and it is an economic pillar to our success. So we shouldn’t give over our keys to anyone. We should be careful of putting market power in the hands of one or two companies. ” Several people who had been lobbied by Facebook  —   and a few insiders at the company  —   remarked with distaste that the company had “no skin in the game” as one put it. “The pipes belong to the phone companies, and they pay the marketing costs of bringing new users online,” the former NASSCOM executive said. “So what exactly did Facebook bring here?” When I asked the Facebook executive why the company had failed to heed the growing protests and carried on fighting so hard for Free Basics, he pointed to Zuckerberg’s intense belief in Facebook’s mission. “This happens every time Facebook pushes out a new change,” he said. “New privacy settings? People protest, Facebook changes it just a little, and people get used to it. The same thing probably happened here. Mark would have thought people would get used to it. ” In the months after the ruling, Facebook went quiet in India. The company’s managing director there was transferred, and there were murmurs within Facebook that a new person was being hired to head up Free Basics in India. But the bustle and combativeness of the previous year was gone. The company seemed to be turning its attention to China. In March, Zuckerberg was photographed on a jog in Beijing, where he was mocked online for declining to wear a face mask in deference to his hosts, despite the smog. The next day, Zuckerberg  —   who has been brushing up on his Mandarin  —   had a meeting with China’s propaganda chief, Liu Yunshan. According to official reports in the local media, the Facebook founder vowed he would work with Chinese peers to “build a better world in cyberspace”. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.

What the American revolution can teach us about Brexit
Last Thursday, as it became clear that the citizens of the United Kingdom were voting to leave the European Union, a lot of Americans began scratching their heads. What was this monumental decision that was sending shockwaves through the financial markets and threatening to rewrite the map of Europe? And, more importantly, why should we care? Since the vote, a flurry of articles have addressed the effects of Brexit on globalization, on the US economy, and on our national security. But Britain could actually learn a thing or two from the United States  —   after all, we staged our own Brexit in 1776. Granted, ours was fought with muskets and fixed bayonets, but there are similarities between America’s fight for independence and Britain’s desire for a greater control in its own affairs. Moreover, despite Britain’s deep desire to hold onto its American colonies, our revolution also provided unintended economic benefits for Britain. Should Brexit actually happen, there’s a chance that this revolution at the ballot box might also benefit the UK in ways that people don’t yet realize. Both the American revolution and the Brexit vote were, at their core, about commerce. Even those whose knowledge of the war of independence is shaky remember the rallying cry of the colonists: “No taxation without representation!” Laws such as 1765’s Stamp Act (designed to defray costs of the seven years’ war) made Americans feel as though they were always on the short end of the economic stick. Americans wanted to keep their   cash in the colonies, not send it off to Britain. Similarly, a centerpiece of the leave campaign  —   walked back immediately after the vote  —   was the claim that £350m a week sent by Britain to the European Union would instead be pumped into the UK’s National Health Service. While this wasn’t precisely a matter of “no taxation without representation” the sense that British money was pouring into Europe with little to show in return has direct parallels to America’s economic woes in the 18th century. There’s also no denying that xenophobia played a major role in the Brexit vote. What is often forgotten about America’s early history is that we were plagued by cultural isolationism, too. In 1774, the   “Intolerable Acts” imposed by Britain on the colonies after the Boston Tea Party, included the Quebec Act, which gave French Catholics religious freedom in exchange for loyalty to the crown. Many protestants in the the 13 breakaway colonies were united by   zeal and saw this as too much foreign influence. If Catholics were granted rights in Canada, what might happen down here? But if Americans thought that winning the war would stem the tide of immigration, they were utterly wrong. There’s been a tension in the United States since its founding between the   and those who have immigrated, and there has never been a moment in American history when some race or nationality hasn’t been the focus of   fervor. Those in the UK who voted to leave the EU may think they’ve won a small victory in tightening Britain’s borders, but if America’s history is a model, there’s little that can actually be done to slow immigration. More importantly, should they even want to? After all, America’s strength lies in its rich tapestry of citizens drawn from every corner of the globe. The same is true in the UK. London has been a cosmopolitan city for millennia even those UK citizens who think of themselves as entirely British have cultural and physical DNA drawn from Danes and Saxons and Romans and French and Celts. Is now the time to turn back the clock to some imagined past that doesn’t see foreign influence? It would be impossible the idea that Brexit can “Make Great Britain great again”  —   to steal a slogan from Donald Trump  —   is at best a fantasy. At worst, it sets a dangerous precedent that says nationalism derives solely from race and heritage, while migrants who choose to embrace a new homeland are interlopers. In November, we shall see if Americans want to go down a similar path. Donald Trump’s rhetoric about congratulating Britain on its newfound “declaration of independence” is just a cover for saying that he, too, would like to reject people in the United States  —   be they   citizens of Mexican descent or Muslim immigrants drawn to the freedoms secured by the American revolution  —   who do not fit his model of what it means to be an American.  One reason immigration is important is that after America had won the war of independence, it did not suddenly find itself living in splendid isolation. In fact, the country’s major trading partner became Great Britain, with the United States importing far more from its former fatherland than it could export in those early years. Like early America, Britain today cannot be a   nation. Goods, human capital, and money will continue to need to flow in and out of the country. Trading partnerships with EU countries may become more strained, but they can’t disappear. In the late 18th century, the new United States needed to quickly become a part of a complex global network. While alliances have shifted over the centuries, that network remains intact. Brexit makes maintaining that network more difficult. As British politicians vie for power in the aftermath of the vote, financial markets will stay volatile. As EU citizens living in Britain wonder what’s going to happen to their livelihoods, companies will have to think hard about how much investment they want to make in Britain. History teaches us that the British economy will recover eventually, but it will take time. What could set that recovery back enormously would be the election of Donald Trump in November. If he imposes even a fraction of his ideas about dismantling trade agreements, building Mexican walls, or deporting immigrants, tremors in the financial markets could become   earthquakes. What the American revolution teaches us is that there’s a difference between freedom and isolation indeed, America’s place as a pinnacle of freedom has only been achieved by fighting against its isolationist tendencies. If Brexit is implemented, the UK will sacrifice freedom for isolation. We can’t let that happen in America, too.

Mark Cavendish ‘looking to win more’ with Tour de France record in sight
Mark Cavendish has his sights on Eddy Merckx’s   record of 34 career stage wins in the Tour de France after landing his third stage win in six days here, lifting his victory tally to 29, one clear of the   overall winner Bernard Hinault. After Monday’s photo finish, Cavendish had a more generous margin over the German Marcel Kittel, the victor on Tuesday in Limoges, and his fellow Briton Dan McLay, who is improving day by day in his first attempt at the race. In a chaotic finish, with no team able to take control in the final few kilometres, Cavendish based his sprint on Kittel, and he sprang off the German’s wheel in the final 200m, overhauling him rapidly, with McLay leaving his effort even later, and accelerating even more rapidly to draw virtually level with Kittel on Cavendish’s right. Unlike his victory in Angers on Monday, the Manxman had enough time to look to his left to reassure himself that Kittel was well behind. “I knew I had to get Kittel’s wheel, he’s so much bigger than me, and if you get a slingshot off his wheel, you can go about three kilometres an hour faster,” said Cavendish, who had to function without his usual   in the final kilometres. It did not faze him, however. “When I was young, 90% of the time I won without a team,” he said. The victory put him back in the green points leader’s jersey, although that is not on his   this year. It is four years since the 2011 world champion won three stages in the Tour and he has never been so successful this early in the race his wins tend to come later, when the opposition tires. He will target the omnium and team pursuit at the Rio Olympics, but prior to that he has repeatedly said hewill do all he can to complete the Tour. The mountain stages begin on Friday, but he will have another three or four opportunities, and with his confidence sky high he has every chance of drawing closer to Merckx’s tally, although he would not speculate on that. “The history of the Tour de France shows that just one stage win can make a rider’s career. I like to give the race the respect it deserves and not think about the numbers,” he said. “I’m just looking to win more, to win as much as possible. ”

Greece on collision course with lenders as ESM freezes debt relief
The dispute between Greece and its creditors has turned more ugly after the European body financing the country’s €86bn (£72bn) bailout programme decided to freeze a deal on   debt relief measures. The prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, was taken by surprise on Wednesday when the European Stability Mechanism announced it would not honour an accord to ease the burden of repayment obligations on Greece’s debt pile. The decision, taken in direct retribution for a series of surprise social welfare measures unveiled by the leader, is likely to put Athens on a war footing with lenders amid mounting signs of the Greek crisis flaring again. Last week, Tsipras took the unexpected step of declaring a     bonus for an estimated 1. 6 million retirees living on €800 or less a month. This week he added that the Aegean islands would be exempt from a sales tax demanded by creditors.  “Following recent proposals by the Greek government to spend additional fiscal resources for pensions and VAT, our governing bodies have put their decisions temporarily on hold,” said a spokesman for the ESM, referring to a deal that would have deferred an interest rate increase on Greece’s debt.  “Institutions are currently assessing the impact of Greek government decisions    the ESM programme commitments and targets. [We] will then analyse the institutions’ assessment and subsequently decide how to proceed. ” The announcement followed a statement by the Euro group of finance ministers, representing members of the single currency, which also suggested that Athens had acted out of line. Earlier on Wednesday Germany  —   the single biggest contributor to the three bailouts Greece has received since 2010  —   said the benefits were incompatible with programme targets. But Tsipras, whose popularity has waned considerably since his leftwing government implemented wage cuts and tax increases it once vowed to overturn, appears in defiant mood. Despite the outcry he has categorically refused to rescind the special pension supplement, saying the €617m required for the bonus will be drawn from the budget surplus his government has managed to achieve.  Visiting the northern city of Thessaloniki on Wednesday, he ratcheted up his   rhetoric, announcing that Athens would spend €11. 5m next year extending free meals to 30, 000 underprivileged schoolchildren.  “This programme has been factored in to the budget of 2017,” he told local mayors, denying the aid would derail the programme of tough fiscal targets Greece has agreed to meet. “I think everyone has to respect the Greek people, who for the last seven years have made huge sacrifices in the name of Europe. We have carried the weight of the refugee crisis. In the name of Europe we have, in recent years, implemented an extremely hard policy of austerity. There has to be respect from all. ” The prospect of the Greek debt crisis flaring up again came as Athens also sparred with the International Monetary Fund which, with the exception of a third bailout signed last summer, has supported the rescue packages shoring up the Greek economy. On Tuesday Tsipras derided IMF staff as “foolish technocrats” who had repeatedly miscalculated the impact of recessionary policies on the country.  “They can’t even get their numbers right,” he said, after Greek officials reacted furiously to what they described as intense IMF pressure to adopt further austerity once bailout loans end in 2018. “They’ve often admitted that they’ve been wrong, but now they’re telling us again, ‘What’s wrong is right’. ”  With tensions escalating  —   and local media painting relations with creditors in terms of open warfare  —   any hope of concluding an ongoing review of the latest programme has quickly faded.  Tsipras, who hopes to break the deadlock in talks later this week with his French and German counterparts, has signalled that he will ask the IMF to withdraw from the bailout altogether. Few believe that will assuage creditor sentiment at a time when Athens is perceived to be dragging its feet on reforms.

US investigates if Russia may be trying to influence election – report
US intelligence officials are investigating the possibility that the Russian government is attempting to influence the US election, according to a new report. The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, is leading an inquiry into whether and how Russian officials may be attempting to influence the election and “provide propaganda fodder to attack US   policies around the world” the Washington Post reported on Monday, Officials who spoke to the Post on condition of anonymity said there was no confirmation of any executed or planned attack, but according to one “even the hint of something impacting the security of our election system would be of significant concern”. He added: “It’s the key to our democracy, that people have confidence in the election system. ” Multiple officials told the Post that if proven, the Russian attempts at sabotage may not be intended to swing the election any particular way, but rather to generally promote chaos and mistrust that could make the US seem less stable and trustworthy in international affairs, potentially diminishing its authorities. Washington and Moscow have been in talks over the ongoing conflict in Syria at the G20 summit in Hangzhou, China. The investigation comes just months after over 20, 000 Democratic National Committee emails were released by WikiLeaks in a hack that has been linked to Russian intelligence. Reports suggest that US officials suspected Vladimir Putin’s administration was involved in the hack, but a senior Obama administration official told the Guardian in July that they could not “unequivocally” attribute the attack to a “Russian state actor”. Around the same time as the DNC hacks, the voter registration systems in Arizona and Illinois were also infiltrated by hackers, raising the concern that cyber sabotage could reap untold damage on the US election. Compromised machines, producing faulty vote tallies, would raise serious questions about the integrity of the political process. “Election administrators are trained to run elections, not defend computer systems,” said Joe Hall, chief technologist for the   Center for Democracy and Technology. “The voting systems we use in many cases don’t keep the kind of evidence one would need to detect an attack, let alone recover from it, without disruption or loss of votes. ”  Last week the Senate minority leader, Harry Reid, sent a letter to the FBI asking its director, James Comey, to investigate the possibility of election infiltration by the Kremlin. “I have recently become concerned that the threat of the Russian government tampering in our presidential election is more extensive than widely known and may include the intent to falsify official election results,” Reid wrote. There is bipartisan concern over the potential ramifications. In a statement, Republican senator from Nebraska Bob Sasse asked the president to openly name the Russian government as the responsible party for the July DNC hack, and more. “Free and legitimate elections are  . It’s clear that Russia thinks the reward outweighs any consequences,” Sasse said. “That calculation must be changed. ”

I went to trade school to improve my skills. I was left with debt instead
I was 41 when I attended trade school in 2015. Having worked seasonal positions in hospitality across multiple states over several years, I found a small town I enjoyed and sought stability. I had $5, 000 in credit card debt at the time.  School was five days a week, eight hours a day. My seasonal position was reduced to weekends. Claiming partial unemployment allowed me to support myself, and federal loans covered tuition.  Attending   school and working weekend shifts, my education was suffering. I resigned from my position so I could focus on school, informing unemployment of this change. I was offered a   position elsewhere but declined, as this would also lead to working seven days a week.  I was informed by the unemployment department that resigning a position to focus on school was not acceptable. I was asked to return funds I had received, a total of $1, 000.  Seeking completion, I was able to finish the fall quarter and sought work over the holidays. With winter in a small town, many businesses’ hours were reduced, or closed altogether. As school began I was without funds. Stressed and anxious at home, I struck the wooden pallet beneath my mattress. It felt like I broke a toe. Then I banged my head on the sloped ceiling and decided enough was enough, and withdrew from school. I then lived off what remained of my first credit card.  Wednesdays of each week I attend the local food bank, waiting on steel chairs in a blue hallway. Families, single mothers, regulars, people who come for a short time, then disappear. Someone studying to be an EMT. Another waiting for fishing season in Alaska to open. Someone in recovery. Volunteers are friendly, never inquiring. They give more food than I purchase for myself. The only information they ask of me is my name. This becomes my winter education. As winter gives way to spring I exhaust my first credit card. As the bank begins extending a second, I am given the option of withdrawing funds without incurring a heavy penalty for a period of time. I experience kindness, room to breathe, though I am now $13, 000 in debt. I would be able to pay the rent. Everyday this goes on, the numbers play on the mind. I continue applying for local work, but also seasonal positions. Being offered several of these, I find myself reluctant to move. Reluctant to give up the cottage I rent, the farm I live on. Gus, the cat who stays with me, provides company during high and low times. These positions are states away, one across the country. The pay is low and will only last a few months before I need to move on. I am uncertain if my car will make the trip. One position will provide housing for 20 days of the month in a hotel. The workdays are 10 to 12 hours. The other 10 days you must find your own space to occupy. I interview for several local jobs. This includes janitor, domestic violence advocate, court clerk, library assistant, housekeeper. With degrees in psychology, library science and a recent history of seasonal work, I am turned down. In the spring I am offered a   dishwasher position in a local cafe. I cut vegetables and wash dishes, scrub floors three days a week in   shifts. I enjoy the physicality of it, it takes my mind away. On days off it takes a day or two for the swelling in my feet and hands to go down. I think of Bill Murray in Coffee and Cigarettes, sitting, drinking coffee from an industrial urn, dressed as a line cook, conversing with RZA. This makes me laugh in absurdity when I’m experiencing mental discord. Shortly thereafter, inside of a month, I am contacted by the local port. Having been turned down for a summer position, another has opened. After interviewing for a second time I am offered a position and accept. It is seasonal and full time, with the possibility of becoming permanent.  My debt is now $16, 000, owed to state, federal and two credit cards.  I have thought about my decisions. I still have my tools, reluctant to part with them. I do not regret my choices. I do not believe wanting to gain skills, experience and education without mental and physical exhaustion is unreasonable.  I accept that this has led me to my current position and continue to seek financial solvency while maintaining a quality of life. I recently applied for a line of credit with my local bank. I am told I have an exemplary credit rating but my rate of pay is too low. I laugh and I am denied. Attempting headway, I am considering having my name changed to Yossarian.

Juno space probe prepares to arrive at Jupiter after five years and 1.8bn miles
Five years and 1. 8bn miles into its voyage, Nasa’s Juno spacecraft is about to slam on its brakes and fall into orbit around the vast,   planet of Jupiter. With all but the most essential equipment switched off for the critical manoeuvre, Juno will turn away from the sun and fire its main engine at 4. 18am Tuesday UK time. All being well, the   burn will slow the spacecraft to 130, 000mph and allow it to be captured by the planet’s immense gravitational field. “The whole team is really excited that we’re finally arriving at Jupiter,” said Scott Bolton, Juno’s lead investigator at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. “We’ve been waiting for a really long time and finally it’s coming. ” Bristling with instruments, Juno will peer deep beneath Jupiter’s clouds to learn how the planet formed what drives its brilliant aurorae and how its complex weather systems produce the giant red spot and the swirling, enigmatic stripes that decorate its outer layers. The planet formed from an enormous gas cloud 4. 5bn years ago under the feeble light of the newborn sun. The material leftover became the rest of the planets, the asteroids and the comets. All would fit easily within the bulk of Jupiter, a planet 11 times wider than Earth and 300 times more massive. “The primary goal is to understand the recipe for how you make a solar system,” Bolton said. “What we can tell from our instruments can help us learn how planets formed in the first place. ” But first the $1. 1bn spacecraft has to arrive safely. Should the rocket burn end too soon or last too long, the mission will be thrown into jeopardy with the probe either failing to reach the right orbit or barrelling straight past the gas giant and onwards to the sun. “There’s a mixture of tension and anxiety because this is such a critical manoeuvre and everything is riding on it. We have to get into orbit,” Bolton said. “The rocket motor has to burn at the right time, in the right direction, for just the right amount of time. ” A tense moment too, then, for staff at Moog Westcott in Buckinghamshire who built the engine. “The years of design, development, and rigorous technical scrutiny by a passionate and driven team, are defined in one   burn sequence,” said site manager Rob Selby. “The team here will be watching the Nasa feed with bated breath. ” For mission scientists at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Lab in California, the first sign that Juno has slowed and swung into orbit will be a change in the pitch of radio signals the probe sends home. It is the same Doppler effect that shifts the tone of sirens on passing police cars. With Juno about half a billion miles away, radio signals from the probe will take more than half an hour to reach mission control. Juno’s most sensitive electronics are encased in a titanium vault to shield them from lethal radiation belts that are most intense around Jupiter’s equator. To avoid the worst of the   environment, Juno will perform highly elliptical orbits that pass over the north and south poles before retreating to a distance of nearly 2m miles. Even so, some equipment onboard will be cooked by radiation long before the mission is over. Over 37 orbits lasting 14 days each, Juno will come within 2, 600 miles of Jupiter’s cloud tops. As cameras and microwave instruments map what lies beneath, scientists will monitor subtle shifts in the frequency of Juno’s transmissions, caused by variations in the planet’s gravitational field due to its uneven internal structure. From the measurements, researchers hope to confirm whether or not Jupiter has a solid core. Launched in 2011 when Nasa faced a shortage of its favoured power source,   Juno relies on the sun’s rays for energy and is already the most distant solar powered spacecraft from Earth. But even with three massive solar arrays, at such distance from the sun, Juno can generate only 500 watts to power its 29 sensors and nine instruments. Jupiter’s poles dazzle with aurorae that are wider than Earth and hundreds of times brighter than the northern lights. With data collected by Juno, researchers led by Stanley Cowley at Leicester University hope to nail down the origins of the spectacular displays. On Earth, the celestial light shows happen when energetic particles in the solar wind are caught in Earth’s magnetic field. On Jupiter, they are powered by the immense energy of the planet’s spin. Hitching a ride on the 3. 5m by 3. 5m spacecraft are three Lego crew members. The Roman god Jupiter, who drew a veil of cloud around himself to obscure his mischief, and his wife Juno, who was able to see through the clouds, are joined by a   Galileo Galilei, who discovered four of Jupiter’s moons. Juno’s first close up images of Jupiter are not expected until late August when the spacecraft swoops towards the surface with its cameras switched on. For the next 20 months the probe will steadily build up an unprecedented map of the planet before its instruments finally fail and the spacecraft plunges into Jupiter’s swirling clouds, never to emerge again.

Many Middle East countries will welcome Trump’s victory. Here’s why
Despite Donald Trump’s   rhetoric, talk of banning Muslims from America, and open hostility towards Syrian refugees, he has some supporters in the Middle East. Authoritarian governments see him as a strongman figure who will make deals with other strongmen like themselves. Some of the Gulf elites hope that, as a   Republican, he will be harder on Iran than Barack Obama. Trump called the deal struck by Obama on Iran’s nuclear programme a “disaster” and “the worst deal ever negotiated”. Conversely, the revolutionary establishment in Tehran welcomes Trump’s election because it thinks this will accelerate what it sees as inevitable US decline. For many others  —   probably the majority of Middle Easterners  —   there is simply a sense that neither candidate had much to offer the region, and that US leaders are all largely the same. Trump’s varied and contradictory statements on Middle East policy, lack of a policy or military track record, and very limited team of foreign policy advisers have left a blank canvas on to which these different observers can project their own wishful thinking. Had Hillary Clinton won, her foreign policy positions would have been unusually predictable, given her extensive track record and an advisory team full of familiar faces. By contrast, Trump’s foreign policy positions on many issues are uncertain, and have been underanalysed, as so much of the professional foreign policy analysis world has, wrongly, judged him to be stupid, mad and incapable of winning. Some conclusions can be drawn, however. Trump has repeatedly expressed his respect for strongmen, saying that even “bad guys” such as Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi could be useful in fighting terrorism. In past interviews he praised China for the Tiananmen Square crackdown while criticising Mikhail Gorbachev for losing control of the Soviet Union. And he has been extremely sceptical about the   international order that successive US presidents have upheld. A video he tweeted on election day showed a montage of Clinton shaking hands with foreign leaders, and clips from the World Economic Forum, contrasting with the   faces of American voters. Compared with Clinton or Obama, he is likely to have a much narrower focus on US interests, more rooted in concerns about the domestic economy rather than being a global policeman or a leader of the free world. There will be even less serious attention paid to democracy promotion, less pressure on human rights abusers, and a strong possibility of cuts in foreign aid. Promoting women’s rights in the region will be harder given the new president’s   comments on sexual assault, which will reinforce the narrative of the region’s social conservatives that   gender norms are immoral and oppressive. But one thing Trump is likely to have in common with Obama is an acute awareness the US public has little appetite for a deeper US military engagement in the Middle East. So the impulse to pivot away from that part of the world will continue, even as events may conspire to suck the US back in. Trump will be more ready than Clinton to strike a deal with Russia over Syria, seeing Vladimir Putin as a man who can fight terrorism. Despite his bluster about “dismantling” the Iran deal, it’s likely that Trump will stick with it. The alternatives are either to reconstruct the previous international sanctions regime, which the US would struggle to do if it unilaterally walked away from the deal, or reconsider the option of another Middle Eastern war, which is one of the last things his supporters will want. On the Middle East peace process, beyond the expressions of support for Israel which are standard in US elections, he has also suggested a two state solution is not a priority  —   and his incentives for investing energy in a particularly unrewarding area of international diplomacy will be low. Trump has said repeatedly that US allies, including those in the Gulf, should pay for the security protection it provides them. This does not mean he will wind those security guarantees down. Saudi Arabia does pay for its security protection, indirectly and implicitly, by massive purchases of US arms and its wider energy and economic cooperation with the US. At a personal level, Trump has real estate investments in UAE, suggesting he sees the country as a safe bet. But Trump is unlikely to get stuck in to the wider regional crises, from Syria to Yemen, where the Gulf countries would like to see the US defending their interests. Thus some of the frustrations that Arab political elites have expressed with Obama are likely to recur with Trump. Broader Arab public opinion is generally critical of what is seen as a history of excessive US intervention in their region. The US’s promotion of democracy and human rights has already been profoundly undermined by the Iraq war and the consequent association of   rhetoric with violent regime change. Some will be glad to see the prospect of a more isolationist US. However, this won’t necessarily translate into more   and sovereignty for the region. Instead there will probably be more multipolar competition by international powers, including Russia, China, India and competing European interests. The mistrust of political elites now observed across the developed world has been the norm in the Middle East for some time. Many have simply viewed the US election with the same black humour often applied to the region’s own politics. Indeed, satirising Trump’s rhetoric about banning Muslims, an advert this week by Jordan’s national airline, Royal Jordanian, promoted deals on flights to the US with a tagline saying: “Just in case he wins   …     travel to the US while you’re still allowed to!”

Fidel Castro’s ashes interred privately as thousands line streets in Cuban city
Fidel Castro’s ashes were interred in a private ceremony on Sunday morning, ending nine days of mourning for the man who ruled Cuba for nearly half a century. A military caravan bearing his remains in a   cedar coffin left the Plaza of the Revolution in the eastern city of Santiago at 6. 39am. Thousands of people lined the   route to Santa Ifigenia cemetery, waving Cuban flags and shouting “Long live Fidel!” The Cuban military fired a   salute and crowds at the entrance to the cemetery sang the national anthem as the ashes entered about 40 minutes later.  The ceremony lasted more than an hour and took place out of the public eye, after Cuban officials made a   cancellation of plans to broadcast the events live on national and international television. International media were also barred from the ceremony. Afterward, members of the public were allowed briefly inside the cemetery to see the tomb, a simple round stone about 15ft high with a plaque bearing his name. The tomb stood to the side of a memorial to the rebel soldiers killed in an attack that Castro led on Santiago’s Moncada barracks on 26 July 1953, and in front of the mausoleum of the Cuban national hero José Martí. An honor guard of a dozen uniformed soldiers stood in front of Castro’s tomb. Before the ceremony ended, martial music could be heard outside the cemetery, where Ines de la Rosa was among the mourners gathered. She said she would have liked to watch the ceremony on television, but “we understand how they as a family also need a bit of privacy”. Another mourner, Elena Vinales, said she wasn’t surprised that the images of the ceremony were not broadcast. “It seems to be a family moment,” she said. The decision to hold a private ceremony came the morning after Castro’s brother, President Raúl Castro, announced that Cuba would prohibit the naming of streets and monuments after the former leader, and bar the construction of statues. “The leader of the revolution rejected any manifestation of a cult of personality,” Raúl Castro told a huge crowd gathered in the eastern city of Santiago, “and was consistent in that through the last hours of his life, insisting that, once dead, his name and likeness would never be used on institutions, streets, parks or other public sites, and that busts, statues or other forms of tribute would never be erected. ” Castro said Cuba’s national assembly would vote in its next session on the law fulfilling the wishes of his brother, who died last month at 90. The legislature generally holds a meeting in December and under Cuba’s   system, unanimously or nearly unanimously approves every government proposal. Fidel Castro, who stepped down in 2006 after falling ill, kept his name off public sites during his near   in power. In contrast, the images of his fellow revolutionary fighters Camilo Cienfuegos and Ernesto “Che” Guevara became common across Cuba in the decades after their deaths. Mourning for Castro has been fervent and intense across the country, particularly in rural eastern Cuba, where huge crowds have been shouting Castro’s name and lining the roads to salute the funeral procession carrying his ashes. “All of us would like to put Fidel’s name on everything but in the end, Fidel is all of Cuba,” said Juan Antonio Gonzalez, a    retired economist.  “It was a decision of Fidel’s, not Raúl’s, and I think he has to be respected. ”

’Justice for some’: advocates worry Jeff Sessions could halt criminal justice reform
Senator Jeff Sessions  —   who accepted Donald Trump’s nomination as attorney general on Friday and now faces a Senate confirmation  —   has been down this road before. Nominated by Ronald Reagan for an appointment as a district judge in 1986, the former US attorney was rejected by the Senate judiciary committee, for allegedly having made racist remarks to colleagues.  The response to his nomination from civil rights groups has been swift. “Our question for members of the United States Senate is simple: do they support racism, or do they not?” said Color of Change executive director Rashad Robinson. “In 1986, the   judiciary committee refused to confirm Sessions to the federal bench. In 2017, the Senate should be just as unequivocal: ‘no’ to racism means ‘no’ to Jeff Sessions. ” The testimony which ultimately seemed to sway the committee some 30 years ago suggested that Sessions referred to black coworkers as “boy” told one to “be careful what you say to white folks” and surmised that a white lawyer in his office might be a “race traitor”. Sessions admitted some of the claims, but called the allegations he was a racist “ludicrous”.  Since then, the highly conservative Sessions has enjoyed a long civil career as the attorney general of Alabama, and as a senator for that state from 1996 to the present. Looking past the accusations of casual workplace racism to his record, the picture is bleak for activists and reformers beginning to consider what the implications would be of Sessions as the nation’s top lawyer. The senator has, throughout his career, been openly hostile to many of the criminal justice reform priorities that have increasingly garnered support from both parties and the American public in recent years. Sessions strongly opposes the reduction of the US prison population, despite the fact that the nation incarcerates more people per capita than any other. “The wise approach is to slow down and evaluate the trends before accelerating prison population decline,” Sessions said in opposition to a bipartisan sentencing reform bill that would have decreased mandatory minimum sentencing, including for nonviolent drug crimes. “Senator Sessions has opposed even modest reform,” said Kevin Ring,   of Families against Mandatory Minimums, an advocacy group pushing for the curbing of harsh   sentencing for drug crimes.  “Whether reform is on just hold, or completely dead remains to be seen,” Ring added. “From President Trump benign neglect may be the best we get. ” Ring holds out hope that Sessions’ declared priorities on terrorism and the department’s limited resources may curb his appetite for ramping up nonviolent drug prosecutions by the Department of Justice. “Hopefully, if not a great sense of compassion or enlightenment, budget math is going to help push him in the right direction,” Ring said. Sessions has expressed particular disdain for marijuana use, and even with national headwinds in their favor, the possible appointment has cannabis reformers reeling. In one of the most startling revelations of Sessions’ failed district court nomination, a former coworker testified that Sessions once stated he found the Ku Klux Klan “OK, until I found out they smoked pot”. Sessions later defended the comment as a joke. “If Trump allows Senator Sessions personal preference to dictate policy, we could be seeing a return to ‘reefer madness’ rhetoric and efforts to shut down   initiatives,” said Erik Altieri, executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (Norml). Earlier this month, California, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts doubled the number of states where the drug is completely legal for medical or recreational use to eight. A majority of Americans now live in states where marijuana has either been legalized or significantly decriminalized in recent years.  At the federal level the drug remains illegal, meaning that an especially zealous attorney general could influence federal agents to raid otherwise legal commercial operations, make arrests and seize property. “Sessions has a long history of supporting what I like to call legalized robbery on behalf of the state, said Altieri, referring to the practice of civil forfeiture. “He could use this as a mechanism to shake down otherwise   business owners, rob them of their profits and put them in the federal coffers. ” Broadly speaking civil forfeiture allows law enforcement to take property from individuals suspected of crimes, even without charging or convicting them. In April 2015 Sessions said he was against “any reform” of civil forfeiture statutes.  Any failure to pursue meaningful criminal justice reform is bound to affect black Americans disproportionately, as they are overrepresented at every level of the system, from policing and use of force through arrest, detention and sentencing, something that increases the relevance of his alleged racist comments, no matter how long ago they occurred. “When Trump rhetorically asked African Americans what they had to lose in this election, this was a big one: a justice department that believes justice for all is its highest mission,” said Lisa Graves, executive director of the Center for Media and Democracy. “With Sessions, ‘justice for some’ would likely be a more accurate motto. ”

Chris Brown arrested on suspicion of assault after hours-long standoff
The RB singer Chris Brown was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon following an   standoff on Tuesday at his Los Angeles home, police said. Police had been called to Brown’s home at 3am local time on Tuesday morning after a woman called police for assistance. The woman told the Los Angeles Times that Brown had pointed a gun at her before she ran away, and that later one of his associates asked her to sign a nondisclosure agreement. Baylee Curran told the newspaper that she and two acquaintances were at Brown’s home to discuss future projects. A man Curran did not know was showcasing jewelry in the home, and Curran said the conflict started when she stopped to look at the jewelry. “I don’t know if it was Chris’ friend or how he was related, but that’s when he told me to back away from the diamond necklace and started cussing me out and calling me names,” she told the Times. “That’s when Chris pulled his gun and told me to ‘Get out,’ he said. ‘I’m sick of you girls, get the   …     out! ’” Curran and a friend ran from the home and waited by the property’s gate while an associate of Brown’s retrieved her phone, she said. The associate reportedly said he’d only give her the phone if she agreed to sign a nondisclosure agreement. Curran said she refused, grabbed her phone and ran to a neighbor’s property while the man gave chase. The neighbor called police, according to the Los Angeles Times. A search warrant was served on the property just before 1pm on Tuesday, nearly nine hours after the 911 call was made.  Throughout the   standoff, Brown posted online videos declaring his innocence. In one Instagram video Brown, waving a cigarette and looking at the camera, said if and when police obtained the search warrant, they would find nothing at the home. He dismissed TV reports that he was barricaded inside. According to the celebrity news site TMZ, police retrieved a duffel bag Brown threw out of the window of his home. Brown was released on $250, 000 bail and is scheduled to appear in court on 20 September, according to jail records. He awaits formal charges and will be arraigned in September, the Los Angeles Times reported. Calls to representatives for Brown were not immediately returned on Tuesday.  Brown has denied any wrongdoing through his longtime attorney Mark Geragos, who wrote on Twitter that the accusations against Brown were “demonstrably false”. The   singer has had multiple   with law enforcement. He spent six years on probation after pleading guilty to attacking his girlfriend at the time, Rihanna, in 2009.

Louisiana governor seeks donors and volunteers after floods: ’We need help’
Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards pleaded for aid for his state on Sunday, saying that after a week of devastating flooding, “we really need help. ” Unlike a hurricane, Edwards told CNN on Sunday, “this rain event didn’t have a name, so we have folks around the country who I think are just now realizing how significant it was. ” Days of extraordinary rainfall caused severe flooding around southern Louisiana this week, killing at least 13 people, damaging an estimated 60, 000 homes and forcing thousands to the shelter of evacuation centers. More than 100, 000 people had registered for federal assistance by Sunday, even as waters slowly receded and many families returned home to find furniture broken and caked in mud, walls weakened by water and early signs of mold spreading through their rooms. “Typically by this point in a storm, I think Red Cross would be receiving a lot more donations I think there would be more volunteers signing up,” Edwards said. “It would be very helpful for people to donate to the Red Cross, to the Baton Rouge area foundation, and also to come in and volunteer to help people get back into their homes as quickly as possible. ” In the small town of Lake Arthur, east of the Lacassine wildlife refuge, authorities barred residents from returning home as teams piled sandbags and worked pumps, struggling to keep the floodwaters out of more homes. In St Amanat, one of the   towns of southern Louisiana, teams continued to go door to door in search of survivors and bodies on Sunday. “It’s much worse than I expected,” resident Sheila Siener told the Associated Press. “The water, the dirt, the smell. Water in the cabinets. Everything’s filthy. I’ve never been through a flood, so I really didn’t know. ”  About 25 miles away in Denham Springs, floods unearthed graves and damaged tombs at one of at least 15 cemeteries in the region that were affected by the rains. Resident Willie Brooks III found that his mother’s vault had vanished. “The vault was completely gone,” Brooks said. “It could be down the street. It could be in the Amite River. I don’t know. ”  Though caskets are almost annually disinterred by floods in the lowlands of Louisiana, Brooks said he had never personally seen it. “It’s like a horror movie. ”  Last week, Barack Obama declared the flooding a major disaster and opened access to federal funding for the parishes of East Baton Rouge, Livingston, St Helena, and Tangipahoa. Edwards praised the federal government for its help in the recovery, saying that Barack Obama granted his request for disaster aid within a few hours, and quickly called the governor to ask how he could help. “I don’t have any complaints at all about the relationship,” Edwards said, adding that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) had offered timely aid. But he stressed that the work was not over: “This is going to take many months. ” The president was criticized by Republicans this week for his response to the disaster, and allies of Republican nominee Donald Trump said Obama had failed to act appropriately by rushing to the state. Trump briefly visited St Amant on Friday and his campaign said he had donated $100, 000 to the Greenwell Springs Baptist church, though when called by the Guardian the church did not immediately confirm it had received the money. Edwards, a Democrat, was diplomatic when asked about Trump’s visit and defended Obama’s response. The governor said he was glad that Trump’s visit “helped to shine a spotlight on Louisiana and the dire situation that we have here” and that he “appreciated the good phone call, the conversation I had with Governor [Mike] Pence,” Trump’s running mate.  He also clarified that Obama had asked him early last week when would be the best time to visit. “I asked him to wait until the response was over and we got into the recovery phase,” Edwards said, explaining that he did not want to divert police officers and state troopers away from rescue efforts and toward security.  “He’s welcome to visit when he wants to, but because we were undergoing the response here in the capital region, I asked that he come next week. ” Obama is scheduled to visit the region on Tuesday.

Sam Allardyce set to be named England manager after FA board meeting
Sam Allardyce’s appointment as England’s new manager on a   contract is set to be ratified on Thursday after the outgoing Sunderland manager convinced the Football Association of his ability to rediscover the national team’s “missing identity”. A meeting of the FA’s National Board at Wembley will   the decision already made by the ruling body’s recruitment panel of Martin Glenn, Dan Ashworth and David Gill that was mandated to identify Roy Hodgson’s successor. That trio were particularly impressed by Allardyce’s innovative, pioneering use of psychology. It leaves Sunderland seeking their seventh managerial appointment in five turbulent years, with the club aiming to accelerate already “advanced” talks with David Moyes about the former Everton, Manchester United and Real Sociedad manager potentially succeeding the    Allardyce. Should such negotiations founder, Burnley’s Sean Dyche also has his admirers in the Stadium of Light’s boardroom. In what was almost certainly his final act as Sunderland manager, Allardyce took charge of the team for Wednesday night’s   friendly at Hartlepool United amid suggestions that his coronation as Hodgson’s successor was a matter of hours away. After stepping off the team bus wearing a smile almost as wide as the North Sea behind him, the     manager took his seat in the away dugout and fielded phone calls during the first half before taking his leave at half time with his side   up. Sunderland released a statement after the match but denied any agreement had been reached. “Naturally we are aware of the intense media speculation this evening, however, at the present time Sam Allardyce remains Sunderland manager,” it read. “We share in the anger and frustration of our supporters and would like to assure them that we are working to conclude the matter in the best interests of Sunderland AFC. ” The FA  —   who did not want to pay over the odds for a   foreign coach  —   are comfortably able to better Allardyce’s £   club salary, so agreeing remuneration was never going to be a problem. Similarly, the fact he has only one year outstanding on his Sunderland contract dictates that compensation does not constitute a major hurdle either. Accordingly, the formalities are predicted to run smoothly and swiftly before his formal “unveiling”. The former Bolton Wanderers, Newcastle United, Blackburn Rovers and West Ham United manager  —   who saved Sunderland from relegation last season and was desperately disappointed to be beaten to the England job by Steve McClaren 10 years ago  —   saw off competition from a shortlist also featuring the USA coach, Jürgen Klinsmann, Hull City’s Steve Bruce and Bournemouth’s Eddie Howe. By way of a major hint earlier on Wednesday, Glenn, the FA’s chief executive  —   revealed that he, Ashworth, the technical director, and Gill, the   had demanded that the new man make concerted, innovative and “unashamed” use of sports psychology to build mental resilience in the face of the “world’s most intensely passionate” press. “The British press, like it or not, are probably the most intensely passionate about the game in the world and that has a spillover effect,” Glenn said. “The consequence of which is people probably play not to make a mistake as opposed to play to win. So the new manager’s got to be someone who can inspire people to get the best out of themselves, build resilience and unashamedly adopt the kind of psychological techniques that other sports and other football teams have done. To really to inspire people that when they put their England jersey on they play as well for England as they do for their club. ” Glenn said he, Ashworth and Gill had “consulted widely in the game and spoken to a handful of people”. Such feedback, frequently from former internationals, kept reiterating one message: the need for mental toughness under media scrutiny. “Speaking to   that have performed well for England it’s a pretty consistent theme, which is resilience under pressure,” said Glenn, whose insistence that media pressure is more intense than in South America or even other parts of Europe is, nonetheless, highly contentious. “Why is that? We need to understand it better. It’s two things: it’s confidence in there being a match plan and it’s personal resilience, especially now at a time of massive social media. ” Glenn and company were also adamant the new manager must not be a “  mercenary” and will duly ask Allardyce to create a legacy as he is given a brief extending well beyond the senior side. “We’re not after a   mercenary, someone just to do the job for a couple of years,” said the chief executive. “I want someone to come into the England role to really work with not just the senior team but to make sure all the great work with the   17s, 18s  —   look at how well the   are doing now  —   continues and to knit all that together. ”

Denver’s working mothers: ’We’re not asking to be rich’
Giovanni Rodriguez wanted french fries. It didn’t matter that his mother, Yolanda Begay, was having dinner with four other working mothers in a Mexican restaurant that didn’t have any, or that she was trying to talk. The    wanted french fries, and he wanted them now. Once he was eventually distracted with markers and a coloring book  —   and having made him promise that he would at least try the cheese quesadillas  —   Begay was able to chat. The    mother, who works for 9to5 Colorado and is also a   student, had money worries on her mind. “When I was [just] a   student, I was able to get assistance,” she said. “When I’m working they want to cut my benefits. ” “So now I have to make compromises and I have to work twice as hard and then it’s going to set me up to fail,” she said. “If I’m working minimum wage, because of the rising cost of rent, I have to make certain decisions. I have to make decisions like, OK, am I able to get groceries, am I able to afford my public transit this week, can I get the basic necessities that I need?” Brenda Lozado, 47, looked across the table at Begay with a face full of sympathy. “I see myself in your story, that’s why I’m like, wow. Because I was a single mom, and deciding whether I use the money for groceries or ‘how am I going to get to work’. And we should not have to decide. Because both of those are very important things. ” Lozado, home healthcare provider, mother of two and grandmother of two, added: “Providing a meal for your kids, you got to go to work to provide things for the home or for your kids. And that should never be an issue as a single parent. ” The two women had joined Agnes Terza, 48, a home and personal care aide, Melissa Benjamin, 38, a home health certified nursing assistant and Alejandra Viellejas, 29, a   porter, to talk about the issues facing working mothers in Denver, where the cost of living has gone up 13. 5% in the last five years but wages have lagged behind inflation. The women all work in industries being organized by the Fight For 15 campaign, which is pushing to raise the minimum wage from $7. 25 to $15 per hour. At the moment, the Colorado state minimum is higher, at $8. 31 per hour and lawmakers are considering putting an increase to $12. 50 on the ballot.  But a few more dollars an hour won’t solve working mothers’ problems. As the women discussed, they’re paid less than male colleagues, they often struggle to find reliable childcare, they lack medical leave and they rarely even get paid time off  —   all issues that the presumptive Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, has championed. Viellejas put her worries very simply: she fears she has to work so much to afford food and housing that she isn’t a good enough parent. “I don’t have time to give to my child, to guide him, to show him, to make a good man out of him,” she said. “And I don’t want him to grow up like I did, alone, because my mom had to go to work. She was a single mother, too, and she left me at home, you know, because she couldn’t pay for a daycare. ” Viellejas said her son’s father refuses to pay child support, which makes things even harder. “I’m a single parent, struggling, I want to have enough time to give to him, to give him family values. And I don’t want him, you know . .. Lozado interrupted: “Thinking ‘Mama don’t have enough money, that I have to go do something’ . .. ” Viellejas: “I mean, I cannot miss a day of work, because I have to pay rent. ” Lozado: “You have to bring food home. You have to have enough money to feed your children. ” Viellejas: “And it’s . .. sometimes I have to work another job to do that, too. ” Hard work, it seems, is not enough.  Benjamin, the nursing assistant, is married, but she still finds herself in a similar economic situation to the other women, hit by the gender pay gap and lack of affordable childcare.  “I make half as much as a man does, and yet I have the children I have, I go to work, I work 40 hours a week. And with that, I should be able to afford my rent and my food and my utilities and childcare if I need it. But I end up just working half the time so I can stay home with my children . .. if I were to go to work double time and pay childcare, I’d still end up with just as much money. So you know, it doesn’t make any sense. And I don’t qualify for any assistance. ” She added: “I’m not even convinced there’s a middle class anymore. There’s the wealthy and the working poor. ” Terza, who lives with her adult daughter and her granddaughter, also talked about the struggles she faces to make ends meet  —   barely. “I juggle, you know. I’ve been struggling with bills and . .. they [home healthcare companies] don’t give you benefits, they don’t give gas [money] they don’t pay for my mileage, and you take care of all these sick people in their homes. And then when you get home with this low paycheck, again, you’re struggling. The money’s not enough for us to take care of our family. No vacation, no sick pay, no benefits. ” “Is there going to be any change or are we just going to juggle?” she asked. “We can struggle and we won’t be able to afford everything. We can’t send our kids to college. Forget that   …     I almost lost my home. ” Lozado, who is also living with a daughter and granddaughter, has been in that situation, too. “We need to have better pay across the board. Minimum wage is not stable enough for us to survive. A lot of us, we are one door outside of being homeless. ” “There was a time that I was really sick, I was out of work for a whole month. And because of me being out of work for a whole month, I was a month behind in bills. And me, I don’t like borrowing from nobody, because it’s almost like they’ve got a chokehold on you. You owe them. ” All the women who were home healthcare aides lacked paid medical leave, which can leave both them and their clients vulnerable. Benjamin said: “When I go into people’s homes, I need to be well. I take care of people with Aids, I take care of people with cancer. They don’t need to get pneumonia from me. So it’s not just about me as a home care worker, it’s about raising the standard of home care not only for myself, but for the people I take care of. ” Terza, too, has seen the negative effects that her lack of paid sick leave can have on clients. “I was sick last year with Type A flu virus. I couldn’t take one day, and they told me to wear a mask on my face to go to my client. She’s 84. ” She said friends were taking in housemates in their 40s and 50s, working multiple jobs just to pay bills. “This is what we call working women: no retirement benefits, no health benefits, and no vacation. I haven’t taken a vacation for   …     since I started home healthcare. ” Begay feels that women like her are trapped in an inequitable system. “We talk about the American dream, and they show this all the time, and this is why they have the advertisements. It’s like we’re these rats to them, and they’re holding up the cheese. And we’re trying to get it, and then we end up in a dead end, and then we have to go around. ” “It’s like we’re always in the same place,” she explained, “And there’s no way we’re getting out. ” Benjamin, like the other women at dinner, think efforts to reduce income inequality and promote economic justice, have been deliberately misconstrued by the media and politicians. “We’re not asking to be rich,” she said. “We just want to make sure we have food on the table and our rent paid we just want to make sure that our shelter and our heat and our food and our children are taken care of. We’re not asking to live in luxury. We’re not asking anyone to give up their wealth to give to us. ” She added: “We’re just asking them to tone it down a little bit so it works, so this society works for everybody that works in this society. ”

Hacking group auctions ’cyber weapons’ stolen from NSA
A mysterious online group called the Shadow Brokers claims to have infiltrated an elite hacking unit linked to the National Security Agency and stolen state “cyber weapons” and is now auctioning them off to the highest bidder. The stolen malware is said to belong to Equation Group, a sophisticated hacking team believed to be operated by the NSA. So far, the Shadow Brokers have only released a few taster files and images of the cache, but security researchers said they appear to be legitimate. The leak, announced in broken English by the group in a series of posts on Twitter, Tumblr, Pastebin and Github, was accompanied by claims that the group was in possession of   “cyber weapons”. “We auction best files to highest bidder. Auction files better than Stuxnet,” said the group, referring to the sophisticated digital weapon, believed to be funded by the US and Israel, that sabotaged Iran’s nuclear programme. The hackers are asking for a whopping 1m bitcoins, which is around $580m, to release the best files. The files and pictures of the cache that were offered for free as “proof” include filenames correspond to those mentioned in documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden, including “BANANAGLEE” “JETPLOW” and “EPICBANANA”. There are also a number of hacking tools used for penetrating network gear including routers and firewalls created by major companies like Cisco and Juniper  —   spy tools which it is already known the NSA uses. “These files are not fully fake for sure,” said security researcher Bencsáth Boldizsár, who is credited with discovering the   Flame malware, in an interview with Ars Technica.  “Most likely they are part of the NSA toolset, judging just by the volume and peeps into the samples. At first glance it is sound that these are important   files, and yes, the first guess would be Equation Group. ” Kaspersky Lab, the security company that first exposed Equation Group’s   in 2015, has published a detailed blogpost showing a “strong connection” between the files found in the leak and their earlier findings about Equation Group. Kaspersky has found encryption algorithms among more than 300 files in the Shadow Brokers’ cache used in a way that has only been seen before in Equation Group malware.  “The chances of all these being faked or engineered is highly unlikely,” says the security company. Although this sounds like a nightmare for the NSA on the face of it, a number of researchers have pointed out that this doesn’t necessarily mean the NSA has been hacked directly. The leaked information is more likely to come from a compromised system outside the NSA’s networks that was hosting NSA malware. If the Shadow Brokers really did have access to the NSA’s network, they wouldn’t blow their cover with a leak. At this stage, it’s not clear who Shadow Brokers are, but some security researchers are speculating that in the wake of the Democratic National Committee hack, which has been publicly attributed to Russian intelligence agencies by Hillary Clinton, this could be retaliation.  “Given the timeframe (  hack) this could possibly be orchestrated by the Russian government so America will be stuck with Donald Trump as a President,” said Matt Suiche in a Medium post.  In a series of tweets, Snowden has outlined his own theory about what happened. He suggests that it is a   attack designed to expose evidence of NSA cyber warfare activities.  “Why did they do it? No one knows, but I suspect this is more diplomacy than intelligence, related to the escalation around the DNC hack,” he posted.  “This leak is likely a warning that someone can prove US responsibility for any attacks that originated from this malware server. That could have significant foreign policy consequences. Particularly if any of those operations targeted US allies. “This leak looks like a somebody sending a message that an escalation in the attribution game could get messy fast,” he said.

Nine Lives review: Kevin Spacey can’t claw his way out of this feline disaster
The first name typically listed in a film’s closing credits is that of the director. Nine Lives breaks that custom. Instead, that honor goes to the film’s two cat trainers. Sure, it’s a nice gesture. But let’s face it  —   the choice is also drolly telling. Cynics will scoff that its director Barry Sonnenfeld probably wants his name expunged from the project, which he very well might. In a year that’s already given us turkeys like Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Warcraft and Suicide Squad, Nine Lives ranks as the most spectacularly inept studio offering yet. Just how inept? It’s a comedy pitched at families that climaxes with a supposed suicide attempt. On paper, Nine Lives should have worked. It features Kevin Spacey playing another egomaniacal prick, magically transformed by everyone’s favorite weirdo, Christopher Walken, into a sassy household cat to learn how to be a better husband and parent. A feline spin on the popular body swap genre, from the director of The Addams Family and Men in Black films, has the makings of summer slam dunk  —   not an outright dud. The bulk of the blame goes to Nine Live’s screenplay, credited to five writers (never a good sign) that fatally rips the fun out of the concept, by mostly being about a shady business takeover.  Spacey’s character, Tom Brand, is a Donald   New York real estate titan so hellbent on constructing the highest skyscraper the city has to offer that he neglects his second wife (Jennifer Garner) whose calls he refuses to answer during work hours, and his young daughter (Melina Weissman) who pines for a pet cat. “I hate cats,” Brand scoffs at the suggestion. “I don’t need another thing to feed. ”  Walken’s “cat whisperer” senses as much when the tycoon shows up at his enchanted cat store, where Brand goes   to appease his kid for her birthday (his assistant must have had the day off) and puts a spell on the curmudgeon. The metamorphosis doesn’t take effect, however, until Brand falls several stories from the peak of his building as the result of a heated altercation with a scheming colleague (Mark Consuelos). So as Brand’s body is left comatose in a hospital bed and his new feline body tries to convince his owners that he’s not in fact Mr Fuzzypants, there’s a competing storyline involving that associate’s plan to sell off Brand’s company. Alarmingly, no one in Brand’s life, including his   and family, seems to care that he’s laid up on life support. The son from his first marriage (Robbie Arnell) who works for him, appears more intent on managing the business than monitoring his father’s health. While his wife and daughter barely shed a tear before shifting all of their focus over to the   addition. And therein lies the problem with Nine Lives: it’s lazy on every level. The script is out to pasture, neglecting to address the interior lives of all of its characters, and failing to deliver a single good punchline. The limp direction lacks the wacky sensibility that characterizes Sonnenfeld’s best work. And voicing Mr Fuzzypants, Spacey sounds uncommonly lethargic  —   like Francis Underwood, stripped of all his verve.

If we don’t act now, all future wars may be as horrific as Aleppo
A single day of fighting in June 1859, among the vineyards and villages near Lake Garda, left 40, 000 Italian, French and Austrian soldiers dead or wounded. The Battle of Solferino might have been remembered simply for its carnage, but for the presence of Henry Dunant. Dunant, a Swiss traveller, spent days tending the wounded and wrote a memoir that led to the founding of the Red Cross and to the first Geneva convention, signed by Europe’s great powers in 1864. Solferino inspired the principle that hospitals and army medical personnel are not a legitimate target in war. Today, with the bombing of hospitals by the Russians in Syria, the Saudis in Yemen and the Americans in Afghanistan, those who provide medical aid in war believe that principle is in ruins. So far this year, according to Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) 21 of their supported medical facilities in Yemen and Syria have been attacked. Last year an MSF hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan was destroyed by a US attack, in which those fleeing the building were reportedly gunned down from the air, and 42 patients and staff died. A UN resolution in May urged combatants to refrain from bombing medical facilities. MSF says that the resolution “has made no difference on the ground”. Four out of the five permanent members of the UN security council, it says, are actively involved in coalitions whose troops have attacked hospitals. To understand the renewed popularity of killing sick people in hospital beds, it’s not enough to point  —   as MSF does  —   to the new techniques of war, such as drones and special forces. Something has been eroded about our perception of humanitarian principles. The Red Cross was, at its inception, both a global humanitarian movement and an alliance of national,   volunteer units. The two did not seem contradictory. As long as a nation’s army’s hospitals obeyed the Geneva strictures  —   separating themselves from defensive military positions  —   civilian medics could volunteer on the understanding they would not be deliberately harmed. That could not be further from the ideological framework under which modern wars are fought. Since the Rwandan and Bosnian genocides, and with the fragmentation of numerous states along religious or ethnic lines, the essential story of modern conflict has become “we, the normal folk, against an inhuman, alien and irrational foe”. Though this meme was there in the wars of the Solferino era, it was also tempered by the desire to establish international law, and by the existence of labour movements capable of issuing   appeals for “peace between brothers”  —   as both the French and Germans did during the   war. Once you understand that the enemy soldier lying on the operating table is someone’s son, and that your own son might be lying on the same kind of table across the lines, there is a logic to the principles of the Geneva conventions. But it is currently being trashed. If you want to point the finger, you could start with George W Bush. His administration’s refusal to treat   detainees in Afghanistan as combatants, and its institutional tolerance of torture, sexual violence and   killing set a baseline for the crimes currently being perpetrated by Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Russia and the Syrian regime. The “collateral murder” video, among evidence alleged to have been released by Chelsea Manning, showed a US Apache helicopter obliterating an ambulance in Baghdad as it collected the wounded. This was done by sticking to the US military’s rules of engagement, not breaking them. Since Iraq,   barbarity has of course been ruthlessly mirrored and bettered by the war criminals of Isis, for whom the Geneva conventions’ prohibitions read like a   list. But there’s something deeper at work, eroding in our attitudes to mercy. The men and women Dunant inspired had a horror of war born of their experience of it: the more total it became, the more interest the population had in moderating military behaviour. Modern media coverage sanitises war. Broadcasting rules in the UK, for example, place strict limits on showing death, mutilated bodies and the agony of wounded people  —   all the things that inspired Dunant to change the world. Our grandfathers’ generation were surprised and shocked by the ways in which the Nazis broke the Geneva conventions. We have come to expect they will be broken in all wars. Though the US has apologised for the Kunduz attack, and disciplined 12 people in the military for the errors that caused it, initial coverage in the US media actually justified the attack on the hospital because it was said to be treating   fighters.  Now, as the Russian airstrikes against hospitals in   areas of Syria reach a crescendo, there is a campaign of justification centred around the accusation that the Syrian White Helmets  —   a medical relief group funded by both the US and EU  —   is “not neutral”. Regardless of the White Helmets’ funding by western powers, the issue of its neutrality is secondary to the fact that it is a medical organisation. It runs ambulances rescue services  —   and both are entitled to protection under the Geneva conventions, just as a British military hospital would be. The danger should be obvious. If we do not stop and punish the targeting of hospitals in the asymmetric wars, then the next big war  —   should it occur  —   will see the Geneva conventions go out of the window. Guernica showed a generation what the second world war would be like Aleppo shows you what any future conventional conflict will descend to, if we don’t act. Marine Buissonniere, MSF’s senior   believes that, at the bare minimum, the UN secretary general needs to appoint a special representative mandated to investigate military attacks on hospitals. But we need more than words around the UN table. We need a movement from below, such as the one that created the Red Cross, and which built MSF in the 1970s. We need to understand  —   as the pioneering trauma medics of the 19th century understood  —   that if you tolerate inhumanity in war elsewhere, it can easily arrive on your own doorstep.

Trump’s pick for key health post known for punitive Medicaid plan
Seema Verma, Donald Trump’s choice to head the two largest public health insurance programs in the US, is a conservative darling who has introduced work requirements and lockout periods for impoverished recipients into the medical safety net in three states. A close adviser to    Mike Pence, Verma  —   Trump’s nominee for administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)  —   made her name devising Indiana’s Medicaid plan, one of the most punitive in the country. Medicaid is a public health program that ensures America’s poor and disabled have health insurance. Obamacare dramatically expanded the program, which now serves more than 73 million people. The unique requirements Verma and her consultancy firm SVC Inc designed for Indiana require that the destitute in that state have “skin in the game” by paying “premiums” even if they were just $1.  In Kentucky, her company developed a plan to require the poor to perform “work activity” which could include unpaid community service, in order to receive health insurance. Approval of that plan is still pending at the CMS, the agency she could soon lead. In Ohio, a plan designed by Verma’s company and rejected by the current leaders of CMS required people with low incomes to be barred from public health insurance until all “premium” arrears were up to date. Her plans were “about saving the dollars by any means possible” said Indiana Representative Charlie Brown, the ranking Democrat on the public health committee. As a consultant in each state, Verma was the driving force in designing Indiana’s “HIP 2. 0” public insurance plan for the poor, and is highly regarded in conservative circles because of its emphasis on personal and fiscal “responsibility”.  Though her plan expanded Medicaid to nearly 400, 000 Hoosiers, she has argued that new recipients are “ ” enough to not need “the same set of policy protections” as the “aged, blind, or disabled”. Instead, Verma’s plan forces recipients to pay up to 2% of their income to “premiums” held in a system similar to   accounts available to commercial plans.  It is a plan meant to mimic the commercial market, as a financial lesson for its recipients. It remains one of the most complex and punitive Medicaid expansions in the country, an outlier in a system of   safety nets largely free for the poor.  Further, it is built on the back of the Affordable Care Act, a law that her potential future boss, Congressman Tom Price, explicitly opposes. Trump has nominated Price to be health secretary.  “She’s a hired gun,” said Brown, who described his interaction with Verma as “intense and daily”. “That’s what she was in Indiana, that’s what the administration wanted  —   to save dollars, and so she comes up with masterful plans. ” By 2014, Verma’s small company had secured $3. 5m in state contracts with Indiana. She is often described as a    Republican operative. Regarded as smart and talented, she is also considered   and conservative. She is a registered Republican, and recently agreed to participate in the “leadership network” of the American Enterprise Institute, a rightwing thinktank. Her father, Jugal Verma, 77, described her as someone with “passion” for her work, and sympathy for the poor. Each morning on her way to work, he said, she pulled her car to the side of the road to hand the same homeless man cash. “It used to amaze me,” he said.  “She grew up in a Democratic household. I am a staunch Democrat,” said Jugal Verma, discussing his daughter’s work in the deeply conservative Pence administration. “She doesn’t do anything if she doesn’t believe in it. ”  She and Price, if he is confirmed by the Senate, will be charged with helming a more than $1. 1tn budget dominated by public health programs for the very poor, disabled and elderly. Medicaid alone covers more than 73 million Americans, nearly   of the American population. Neither Verma nor a Pence spokesman replied to a request for comment.  Verma’s best known work used a   provision of federal health law to push conservative ideas through despite the Obama administration. The strategy made her an influential consultant to Republican state administrations. In Indiana, for example, some of the most controversial provisions of the state’s law were pushed through using this obscure 1115, or “ ” waiver. While Obama’s administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services did not approve all of Verma’s plans  —   a punitive provision developed with Ohio was denied  —   some were successful. Others are still pending the approval of an agency she may soon run. “One example of a provision in Indiana, which I think is very severe, burdensome, and in fact does not promote the objectives of the Medicaid program, [is] if someone [can’t pay premiums] they get kicked off the program,” said Andrea Callow, a policy analyst at Families USA, a    organization focused on consumer health.  Premiums are typical of commercial insurance plans  —   they require beneficiaries to make a monthly payment. But Medicaid recipients typically do not pay premiums because their incomes are so low. The Medicaid expansion carried out under Obamacare allows people to earn a salary of about 138% of the poverty level, about $16, 000 for an individual, and remain eligible.  In Indiana, if people on Medicaid earning between $11, 000 and $16, 000 don’t pay their “premiums” they can be locked out of the program for up to six months, a provision even commercial insurance does not impose.  “If someone can’t scrape up the money for premiums for two months, they get   and they get locked out for six months,” said Kallow. “Then say they get cancer, they get hit by a truck, they have an accident. They have absolutely no place to turn for health coverage. ”  Kentucky’s 1115 waiver, on which Verma’s company SVC also consulted, proved equally complex and even more controversial. The state asked CMS to allow Kentucky to impose work requirements beginning three months after benefits began, something no state in the country requires as a condition of Medicaid. “Kentucky’s new expansion proposal has work requirements,” said Kallow, “There’s even sort of unpaid community service, which is very troubling. ”  After three months, “ ” adults of working age would need to participate in a “work activity” for at least five hours per week. After one year, that requirement would increase to up to 20 hours per week. If that requirement were not met, the state could end the person’s benefits.  “There seemed to be a paralysis of analysis as it relates to the downtrodden, those who are in the greatest needs,” said Brown.  During a public comment period on Kentucky’s 1115 waiver, 90% of the 1, 700 comments received were negative. Analysts also contend that such requirements mean building a new, large bureaucracy just to track whether Medicaid beneficiaries are complying.  “I have no problem with the personal responsibility features to the extent that they improve outcomes,” said Ed Clere, former Republican chair of the Indiana House public health committee. “One of the big questions going forward, both for Indiana and now for the country, will be: is there a link between these personal responsibility features in the way of financial participation and improved healthy outcomes? “I haven’t seen any evidence. ” However, even critics said portions of the plan designed by Verma improved services. The fact that a voluntary,   Medicaid expansion took place at all in Indiana, a deep red state, had a huge impact in the eyes of many serving poor patients there. Another 19 states still have not expanded Medicaid, even though Obamacare pays for 90% of expansions.  “I have insurance, my child is sick, I take her to the doctor,” said Lauren Lamb, outreach coordinator at a chain of   Indiana health clinics, HealthLinc. “I don’t think about it, but when you see people that don’t have that coverage . .. they worry if their kid is sick, if they can even take them to the doctor. ” The change, Lamb said, comes when patients realize they are eligible for health insurance they can afford.  “You see them, and they leave, and they’ve got tears in their eyes, because they can’t believe how lucky they feel that day. It just sits in your heart. ”

Harvard ends men’s soccer team season over lewd rankings of female players
Harvard University has suspended its men’s soccer team for the remainder of the season because of sexual comments made about members of the women’s soccer team. University president Drew Faust said in a statement on Thursday night that an investigation into the 2012 team found their “appalling” actions were not isolated to one year or the actions of a few, but appeared to be more widespread across the team and continued through the current season. “The decision to cancel a season is serious and consequential, and reflects Harvard’s view that both the team’s behaviour and the failure to be forthcoming when initially questioned are completely unacceptable, have no place at Harvard, and run counter to the mutual respect that is a core value of our community,” Faust said. A 2012 document uncovered last month by the Harvard Crimson student newspaper rated the attractiveness of recruits on the women’s team and included lewd comments about them. Members of the men’s team called it their “scouting report” and circulated it online. “I was saddened and disappointed to learn that the extremely offensive ‘scouting report’ produced by the 2012 men’s soccer team continued through the current season,” dean Rakesh Khurana said in a statement. “As I have stated, such behavior is antithetical to Harvard’s fundamental values. ” Athletics director Robert Scalise sent an email to student athletes on Thursday announcing that the university was cancelling the remainder of the team’s season, including postseason play. The men’s soccer team is currently in first place in the Ivy League. Scalise said the team would forfeit its remaining games and decline any opportunity to achieve an Ivy League championship or participate in the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association) tournament this year. “As we move forward, Harvard Athletics will partner with the office of sexual assault prevention and response and other Harvard College resources to take additional steps to further educate the members of our men’s soccer team, and all of our student athletes, about the seriousness of these behaviours and the general standard of respect and conduct that is expected,” Scalise said in the email. Six of the women rated in the report expressed their disappointment with the men’s soccer team and with a culture that permits widespread objectification of women in the Harvard Crimson last week. “Having considered members of this team our close friends for the past four years, we are beyond hurt to realize these individuals could encourage, silently observe, or participate in this kind of behavior, and for more than four years have neglected to apologize until this week,” the women wrote. The women  —   Kelsey Clayman, Brooke Dickens, Alika Keene, Emily Mosbacher, Lauren Varela and Haley Washburn  —   graduated in 2016 and had seen the entire “scouting report”. “This document attempts to pit us against one another, as if the judgment of a few men is sufficient to determine our worth,” they said. “But, men, we know better than that”.  The men’s team was at the top of the Ivy League rankings and set to secure an automatic bid into the NCAA tournament had it won Saturday’s scheduled home game against Columbia University. But with the suspension, the team must forfeit the remaining regular season and postseason competitions. “We are beyond disappointed that our season has ended in this way, but we respect the decision made by our administration,” said men’s coach Pieter Lehrer in a statement. “Actions have consequences, and character counts. We accept responsibility for our actions, and I know that we will use the experience of this terribly unfortunate situation to be better”. Harvard’s women’s soccer team is still scheduled to play Columbia on Saturday.

Rio Olympics: Michael Phelps bows out with another Olympic gold – as it happened
Right, that’s about all I’ve got for you. We’re pulling down the curtains on day eight of these Rio Games, but before you know it  —   here’s day nine! Follow all the action here, live, during a day that finishes with, guess who  —   a certain Jamaican and a certain short running race. Yes please. And at the Riocentro for boxing, in the big boys’ category (or men’s super heavy 91kg+ for the purists) Kazakhstan’s Ivan Dychko has ended the campaign of Azerbaijan’s Mahammadrasul Majidov setting up a quarter final clash with Nigeria’s Efe Ajagba. What’s this got to do with me, says you, British Olympics observer? Well, if you’ve been following Joe Joyce’s progress you’ll know that should he get past his next opponent, Uzbek Bakhodir Jalolov, then a showdown with one of these aforementioned gents awaits. The plot thickens. A few recent results from the   as British pair Heather Olver and Lauren Smith recorded their first win in the women’s doubles event. They edge Hong Kong pair Ying Suet Tse and Lok Yan Poon in a tight three set tussle, but will unfortunately still miss out on a spot in the quarter finals. The tournament has also ended for Australian mixed doubles pair Robin Middleton and Leanne Choo, after they succumbed to Thai pairing Bodin Isara and Savitree Amitrapai. An excellent piece from Andy Bull here detailing Mo Farah’s remarkable 10, 000m victory. It’s brutally hard to win a race like this at the best of times, let alone after you’ve hit the deck and had to scramble back halfway through. And if you missed the day’s field hockey action, in the women’s competition New Zealand have ended China’s tournament, with a   final group stage victory. The result left China fifth with the top four in each pool going through. By finishing second New Zealand have set up a fresh chapter of an ancient grudge match, as they face   rivals Australia in the quarter finals. The Hockeyroos  —   as they’re affectionately, and perhaps, unoriginally known  —   started the Games poorly, losing their opening two group games to Great Britain and the United States, but are coming off three straight wins. Great Britain and the Netherlands remain the only two unbeaten sides thus far and face Spain and Argentina respectively in the knockouts. Incidentally, there’s been 53 Olympic records set at these Games thus far including 19 world records. Day eight saw USA’s Ryan Murphy finally cracked compatriot Aaron Peirsol’s   100m backstroke record. It’s been one of the world’s great markers  —   in fact Peirsol has only NOT held that particular record for one week during the past twelve years.  Remarkable stuff, and congratulations to Murphy. So to recap the overall medal tally, four more gold on day eight see United States continue to stretch their lead at the top over China, who failed to add to their tally of gold. Great Britain continue their storming Games with gold on the track, in the velodrome and at the final day of rowing. Amuse yourself by scrolling through the 200+ nations on the drop down menu and see who’s won what for whom. For example, no medals for Pakistan or Serbia yet, but the Uzbeks have three bronze.  A huge result also in the volleyball (of the   flavour) where Italy has continued it’s dominant form in the group stage by sweeping aside hosts, and world no1 ranked side, Brazil,  . The home team won the first set,   but were playing   thereafter. Italy remain the only unbeaten team going into the final group stage games, and could face whoever finishes fourth from either Russia or Iran, who face off in group B’s remaining   encounter.  And on a night of stunning performances by truly incredible Olympians, who could go past this cat. Michael Phelps, once again the headline act on a dramatic night  —   the last, in fact  —   from the pool at Rio. Five gold medals for the Games, 23 in all. You’d have to go back to Sydney 2000 to find a medley relay winning team that didn’t contain Michael Phelps. Farewell, sweet prince. We spoke earlier of the ‘Super Saturday’   attempt, with Mo Farah, Jessica   and Greg Rutherford once again all in action, but here’s a really lovely   from my colleague, Sean Ingle. Will all three be back for Tokyo 2020? Spoler alert: I don’t reckon. What a remarkable battle that proved to be between   and the young Belgian Nafissatou Thiam though. And it’s finished in emphatic fashion over at the beach volleyball  —   US duo Dalhausser and Lucena have beaten their Austrian rivals in straight sets,    . They’ve only dropped one set all tournament and now complete the quarter final pairings as one of only four teams yet to lose. They’ll face Brazilian 2015 world champions Alison Cerutti and Bruno Oscar Schmidt, which by all reports should prove an absolute cracker. Let’s talk handball, is a phrase that often leaps to mind  —   and we’ve just finished up at the Arena do Futuro, where Argentina have notched their first victory of the Games edging Tunisia,  . A great showing by the Federicos  —   Pizarro and Fernandez  —   with seven and five goals respectively. And before you shout, wait, what about Federico Vieyra, well he got two goals as well.  61% of Argentina’s scoring shots coming from a Federico therefore  —   is that an Olympic record? First with the key stats, us at the Guardian. It sets up an intriguing    battle in the final group game between Argentina and Qatar, as they seek to follow France, Denmark and Croatia into the knockout rounds from group A.  At the basketball, a slight surprise in the last game of the evening  —   Nigeria have shaken up men’s group B with their first win of the Games over   Croatia. The Europeans led   at quarter time but a powerful second stanza saw the Africans storm into the lead. They then refused to relinquish their advantage, running out   winners. It sets Nigeria on a collision course with hosts Brazil  —   whoever wins their last round game could sneak into the top four and qualify for the knockouts. One to watch. Going back to the athletics, you might remember the part long jumper Greg Rutherford played four years ago during ‘Super Saturday’ when British athletes blitzed their home Games. Rutherford, Mo Farah and Jessica   were all looking for a Rio ‘ ’ and while the distance running star powered home for gold and the heptathlete bagged silver, it was a disappointing outcome, apparently, for the   bronze medalllist. And staying on the sand, in the men’s round of 16 it’s currently   for US duo Philip Dalhausser and Nicolas Lucena, who have just taken the first set   against their Austrian opponents, Robin Seidl and Alexander Huber. Dalhausser, you might recall, is also a previous gold medallist in the event  —   he’ll be hoping to repeat the magic with new teammate Lucena. At the beach volleyball, in the women’s round of 16 Australian duo Taliqua Clancy and Louise Bawden have made it four wins from four, as they came back from a set down to defeat Polish duo Monika Brzostek and Kinga Kolosinska,  .  Their reward for such a strong start to the Games? A quarter final bout with favourites USA’s April Ross and Kerri Walsh Jennings. Yikes. For those of you not familiar with Walsh Jennings, you might remember her as the gold medal winner from London. And Beijing. And Athens. Hi all. Just catching our collective breath here in the Australian office after a massive few hours in swimming and athletics, led by the indomitable Michael Phelps and Mo Farah.  Scenes at the football too as local boys Brazil survive a   with continental rivals Colombia  —   so much pressure on the slender shoulders of Neymar Jnr, but after some disappointing performances in the group stage the hosts appear back on track. To recap, Brazil face surprise winners Honduras in the semi final, with Germany and Nigeria to contest the other semi. But   the action isn’t over in Rio just yet. At last check there’s still live badminton, basketball, volleyball (beach and hall varieties) handball and table tennis taking place. We’ll endeavour to get round the venues for you as best we can. I’m going to hand over the liveblog to Richard Parkin. He will take you from here.  Michaels Phelps now has 23 gold medals. He says he’s done and sports fans tend to get surly when athletes retire and  . But I don’t think anyone would be upset if Phelps changed his mind and came back again for 2020 to go for even more gold. Over to Richard.  Final: Brazil   Colombia, Brazil now moves on to play Honduras in the semifinals. As you can imagine, the crowd is quite pleased. Nigeria and Germany are set in the other semi. Brazil   Colombia, 84:00 2nd half, That should do it. Luan scores on a beautiful twisting shot after Neymar finds him open right in front, 25 yards away. Brazil is six minutes and stoppage time from moving on to the semis. We already know that Michael Phelps has the most Olympic medals in history. But in this Olympics alone, he would be 17th on the medal list against all other nations. Brazil   Colombia, 75:10 2nd half, Under 15 minutes left. Colombia will have to start attacking. Or, as Hope Solo would say: “not play like cowards. ”  One final reminder . .. if you want updates on tonight’s Track and Field action, Tom Lutz has a liveblog dedicated to that here. The last night in the pool turned out pretty much the same as every other night in the Olympic pool for the past decade   …     with everyone talking about Michael Phelps. By helping the United States to gold in the 4x100 medley relay he now has 28 Olympic medals, 23 of them gold. It is a record that will surely never be beaten. Brazil   Colombia, 65:05 2nd half, Play hasn’t been as rough as the first half. Colombia’s keeper just made a nice save off of a header from a Neymar free kick.  Michael Phelps on winning his 23rd (and last?) gold:  “I was more emotional after this relay than I was last time. I’m just ready for something different. My swimming career might be over, but it’s time do something else. ” But Ryan Murphy, who set the backstroke record, said: “It was an honor to swim in Michael’s last race. Although I don’t think it really was. ” He laughed, but he was serious. Great Britain gets Silver and Australia takes the Bronze.  Michael Phelps now has 23 career golds, and 28 total medals.  The U. S. set a new Olympic record. USA back in the lead thanks to Phelps. USA has a 0. 50 second lead with 100m left. Freestyle. Michael Phelps is now in the pool. Great Britain in first. Let’s see if Phelps can close. USA is in first through the breaststroke.  Ryan Murphy set a world record to open. It counts because it started the relay. USA has a huge 1.  lead. The Men’s 4x100 Medley Relay is underway. They begin with the backstroke. This is Michael Phelps’ 63rd career Olympics race and 30th Olympic final. He will be swimming the fly, so he will be third in the relay.  Next up is the Men’s 4x100m Medley Relay AKA Michael Phelps’ final race. Here are the lane assignments:  Lane 1: Brazil, Lane 2: China, Lane 3: Japan, Lane 4: Great Britain, Lane 5: United States, Lane 6: Australia, Lane 7: Russia, Lane 8: Germany  The relay gold for the United States gives Simone Manuel four medals in her first Olympics. It was also a big night for Denmark’s Pernille Blume, who won Gold earlier in the 50m Freestyle and then anchored Denmark to Silver in the relay. Australia comes back strong behind Cate Campbell in the freestyle to get the Silver and Denmark takes Bronze.  With 100m left, the United States is in first. All that’s left now is the freestyle. Then the medal stand. Denmark second, Russia third. Russia is now in first halfway through the medley relay. The next stroke is the butterfly.  Denmark is winning through the backstroke. The next stroke is the breaststroke. Very tight through the first 100m.  The Women’s 4x100m Medley Relay is underway. The first leg is the backstroke. The teams are about to come out for the Women’s 4x100m Medley Relay Final. The U. S. women are the heavy favorite and it would be a big upset if they don’t take the gold.  End of the first half: Brazil   Colombia, Mercifully, the first half is over. They’ll now head to their respective locker rooms and come up with new strategies for fouling each other. Brazil   Colombia, 45: :50 stoppage time, We have another collision and stoppage in play. There have now been 21 fouls in the match and the first half isn’t over yet. Brazil   Colombia, 44:50 1st half, It’s getting ugly. Colombia’s Wilmar Barrios was just given a yellow card for knocking Neymar to the ground away from the ball. Play is back underway . .. until the next card, at least. Five minutes of stoppage time has been added. Brazil   Colombia, 42:00 1st half, Strong words are being exchanged after Neymar took down Colombia’s Andres Roa with a hard tackle from behind. Play is finally back underway after about five minutes of arguing. The third of tonight’s four swimming events starts in approximately 10 minutes: Women’s 4x100m Medley Relay Final. Lane 1: Italy, Lane 2: Australia, Lane 3: Denmark, Lane 4: United States, Lane 5: Canada, Lane 6: Russia, Lane 7: China, Lane 8: Great Britain, Brazil   Colombia, 32:00 1st half, The local favorites took the lead on a goal by Neymar 12 minutes into the match.  Ryan Cochrane of Canada, who took Silver in the 1500m Freestyle in London, finished sixth tonight. He was 15 seconds behind Paltrinieri.  Connor Jaeger of the U. S. set an American 1500m record at 14:39. 48 in winning Silver. Paltrinieri earns the first Italian gold ever in this event. His winning time: 14:34. 57    just off the world record time. Connor Jaeger of the U. S. gets Silver. And Paltrinieri’s Italian teammate, Gabriele Detti took the Bronze. Paltrinieri in 1st with 100m left.  He has now fallen behind world record pace, but is way ahead of the competition. Jaeger in second and Detti now in third. Paltrinieri still ahead of world record pace with 200m left!  The American duo is still in second and third, but Jaeger is now in third. Detti of Italy making a push in 4th place. Denmark’s Pernille Blume was so happy she was at a loss for words after winning the 50m Freestyle Final.  Probably even happier than she was here:  Nearing the halfway point in the Men’s 1500m Freestyle Final.  Lane 1: Ryan Cochrane, Canada, Lane 2: Gabriele Detti, Italy, Lane 3: Jordan Wilimovsky, United States   Currently in 2nd place. Lane 4: Gregorio Paltrinieri, Italy   Still in first place, right at world record pace.  Lane 5: Connor Jaeger, United States   Currently in 3rd place. Lane 6: Mack Horton, Australia, Lane 7: Damien Joly, France, Lane 8: Henrik Christiansen, Norway  Well, it’s heartbreak again for Australia’s Campbell sisters, who have missed out on medals again in the 50m freestyle, their final event of the Rio swimming schedule. Cate Campbell finished fifth in a time of 24. 15, while sister Bronte faded at the finish to end up seventh in 24. 42. “It wasn’t my best but it’s fair to say this week hasn’t been my best,” Cate Campbell said after the race. “The world got to witness possibly the biggest choke in Olympic history a couple of nights ago. It hurts, but you know, maybe I’ll stick around for another four years. ”

Ship found in Arctic 168 years after doomed Northwest Passage attempt
The   ship of British polar explorer Sir John Franklin, HMS Terror, has been found in pristine condition at the bottom of an Arctic bay, researchers have said, in a discovery that challenges the accepted history behind one of polar exploration’s deepest mysteries. HMS Terror and Franklin’s flagship, HMS Erebus, were abandoned in heavy sea ice far to the north of the eventual wreck site in 1848, during the Royal Navy explorer’s doomed attempt to complete the Northwest Passage. All 129 men on the Franklin expedition died, in the worst disaster to hit Britain’s Royal Navy in its long history of polar exploration. Search parties continued to look for the ships for 11 years after they disappeared, but found no trace, and the fate of the missing men remained an enigma that tantalised generations of historians, archaeologists and adventurers.  Now that mystery seems to have been solved by a combination of intrepid exploration  —   and an improbable tip from an Inuk crewmember. On Sunday, a team from the charitable Arctic Research Foundation manoeuvred a small, remotely operated vehicle through an open hatch and into the ship to capture stunning images that give insight into life aboard the vessel close to 170 years ago. “We have successfully entered the mess hall, worked our way into a few cabins and found the food storage room with plates and one can on the shelves,” Adrian Schimnowski, the foundation’s operations director, told the Guardian by email from the research vessel Martin Bergmann. “We spotted two wine bottles, tables and empty shelving. Found a desk with open drawers with something in the back corner of the drawer. ”   The   wreck matches the Terror in several key aspects, but it lies 60 miles (96km) south of where experts have long believed the ship was crushed by ice, and the discovery may force historians to rewrite a chapter in the history of exploration. The   Bergmann crew found the massive shipwreck, with her three masts broken but still standing, almost all hatches closed and everything stowed, in the middle of King William Island’s uncharted Terror Bay on 3 September.   After finding nothing in an early morning search, the research vessel was leaving the bay when a grainy digital silhouette emerged from the depths on the sounder display on the bridge of the Bergmann. “Everyone was up in the wheelhouse by that point in awe, really,” said Daniel McIsaac, 23, who was at the helm when the research vessel steamed straight over the sunken wreck. Since, then, the discovery team has spent more than a week quietly gathering images of the vessel and comparing them with the Terror’s 19th century builders’ plans, which match key elements of the sunken vessel.  At first, the Terror seemed to be listing at about 45 degrees to starboard on the seabed. But on the third dive with a remotely operated vehicle, “we noticed the wreck is sitting level on the sea bed floor not at a list   which means the boat sank gently to the bottom,” Schimnowski said Monday. About 24 metres (80ft) down, the wreck is in perfect condition, with metal sheeting that reinforced the hull against sea ice clearly visible amid swaying kelp. A long, heavy rope line running through a hole in the ship’s deck suggests an anchor line may have been deployed before the Terror went down. If true, that sets up the tantalising possibility that British sailors   the vessel after she was abandoned at the top of Victoria Strait in a desperate attempt to escape south. One crucial detail in the identification of the ship is a wide exhaust pipe rising above the outer deck. It is in the precise location where a smokestack rose from the locomotive engine which was installed in the Terror’s belly to power the ship’s propeller through closing sea ice, said Schimnowski in a phone interview. The ship’s bell lies on its side on the deck, close to where the sailor on watch would have have swung the clapper to mark time. And the majestic bowsprit, six metres (20ft) long, still points straight out from the bow as it did when the crew tried to navigate through treacherous ice that eventually trapped Erebus and Terror on 12 September 1846. The wreck is in such good condition that glass panes are still in three of four tall windows in the stern cabin where the ship’s commander, Captain Francis Crozier, slept and worked, Schimnowski added. “This vessel looks like it was buttoned down tight for winter and it sank,” he said. “Everything was shut. Even the windows are still intact. If you could lift this boat out of the water, and pump the water out, it would probably float. ”   The Arctic Research Foundation was set up by Jim Balsillie, a Canadian tech tycoon and philanthropist, who   Research in Motion, creator of the Blackberry.  Balsillie, who also played a key role in planning the expedition, proposed a theory to explain why it seems both Terror and Erebus sank far south of where they were first abandoned. “This discovery changes history,” he told the Guardian. “Given the location of the find [in Terror Bay] and the state of the wreck, it’s almost certain that HMS Terror was operationally closed down by the remaining crew who then   HMS Erebus and sailed south where they met their ultimate tragic fate. ” The   search for Franklin’s expedition was launched by Canadian former prime minister Stephen Harper as part of a broader plan to assert Canadian sovereignty in the Arctic and promote development of its resources  —   including vast reserves of oil and natural gas, which will be easier to exploit as the Arctic warms and sea ice disappears. Parks Canada underwater archeologists have led the mission since it began in 2008. Now they must confirm the wreck is Terror, either by examining the foundation’s images or visiting the site themselves. With the first winter snow already falling in the High Arctic, Terror Bay will soon be encased in thick sea ice. The latest discovery was made two years and a day after Canadian marine archeologists found the wreck of Erebus in the same area of eastern Queen Maud gulf where Inuit oral history had long said a large wooden ship sank. The same stories described startled Inuit stumbling upon a large dead man in a dark room on the vessel, with a big smile. Experts have suggested that may have been a rictus smile, or evidence that the man had suffered from scurvy. Parks Canada archeologists found Erebus standing in just 11 meters of ocean. Sea ice had taken a large bite out her stern, and more than a century of   waves had scattered a trove of artifacts around the site. So far, archaeologists have brought up the bell from Franklin’s flagship, a cannon, ceramic plate and other objects. Inuit knowledge was also central to finding the Terror Bay wreck, but in a more mysterious way. Crewman Sammy Kogvik, 49, of Gjoa Haven, had been on the Bergmann for only a day when, chatting with Schimnowski on the bridge, he told a bizarre story. About six years ago, Kogvik said, he and a hunting buddy were headed on snowmobiles to fish in a lake when they spotted a large piece of wood, which looked like a mast, sticking out of the sea ice covering Terror Bay. In a phone interview, Kogvik said he stopped that day to get a few snapshots of himself hugging the wooden object, only to discover when he got home that the camera had fallen out his pocket.  Kogvik resolved to keep the encounter secret, fearing the missing camera was an omen of bad spirits, which generations of Inuit have believed began to wander King William Island after Franklin and his men perished.   When Schimnowski heard Kogvik’s story, he didn’t dismiss it, as Inuit testimony has been so often during the long search for Franklin’s ships. Instead, the Bergmann’s crew agreed to make a detour for Terror Bay on their way to join the main search group aboard the Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker CCGS Sir Wilfrid Laurier and the Royal Canadian Navy’s HMCS Shawinigan, at the north end of Victoria Strait.  That is where the only known record of the Franklin expedition provided coordinates for what experts now call the point of abandonment.  A scrawled note dated 25 April 1848, and concealed in a stone cairn at Victory Point on northern King William Island, said Erebus and Terror had been abandoned three days earlier, stuck in sea ice. Crozier was in command of “the officers and crews, consisting of 105 souls” because Franklin had died on 11 June 1847, the note continued, “and the total loss by deaths in the expedition has been to this date 9 officers and 15 men”. Crozier and Captain James Fitzjames signed the note, which had what seemed a hurried postscript, scrawled upside down in the top right corner: “and start on   26th for Back’s Fish River”. Survivors apparently hoped to follow the river  —   now known as Back river  —   south to safety at a Hudson’s Bay Company fur trading outpost.  None made it, and for generations, the accepted historical narrative has described a brutal death march as the Royal Navy mariners tried to walk out of the Arctic, dying along the way. Now Franklin experts will have to debate whether at least some of the dying sailors instead mustered incredible strength, fighting off hunger, disease and frostbite, in a desperate attempt to sail home.

Roberto Durán: boxing’s imperfect hero is still swinging after all these years
I’m sitting in the lobby of the Smyth Hotel in downtown Manhattan waiting for Roberto Durán, the man they call El Cholo, when I get a phone call from his assistant. “We’re on our way,” he says. “Just to warn you, he’s a little agitated. ” This is expected. Since May, Durán has been on a global press tour for Hands of Stone, a new biopic about the boxer’s life and relationship with mentor Ray Arcel by Venezuelan director Jonathan Jakubowicz, which premiered at the Cannes film festival and had its New York premiere earlier this week. He is here with his wife of more than 45 years, Felicidad ‘Fula’ Iglesias, and his children and grandchildren. Minutes after he arrives Durán pleads with his assistant for some water. “I’m sorry, just give me one moment,” he says in Spanish as he sits down. “I’ve been on my feet since last night. ” It’s been a hectic ride for the    retired fighter who speaks very little English, contending with the demands of a press junket alongside Robert De Niro, Usher and Édgar Ramírez, the Venezuelan actor who plays him in the movie. Once he finally settles, Durán’s attention diverts once again as he keeps greeting his friends and family passing through the hotel lobby. His biggest concern is now an iPod he lost in his hotel room. “All my music is in that thing! We can’t leave until I find it. It has 3, 500 songs. ”  Just as I’m thinking the interview might take all day, it occurs to me that, even as a journalist, in order to get what you want from him you have to match his energy. You have to go in the ring with him. At this precise moment it becomes clear: he’s never truly out of it. Durán is always fighting something. For Latinos, Durán is more than just an athlete or even a sporting legend. He is a mythological figure, a symbol who persists in Latin folklore decades after his fighting career because he represented the will and determination of a community who was fighting the social injustices of the times they were facing. Much like Ali stood up for the civil rights of the   movement in a segregated America, Durán was doing the same thing for the poor and underprivileged in Panama. The film, which alternates between Spanish and English, represents one of the rare chances where an American audience can witness a Hollywood movie where a Latino protagonist is not a crime lord or a drug kingpin. “This is an opportunity to change the Latino stereotype  —   we live in a world where you can call Latinos drug dealers and rapists and criminals and still have a chance at being president of the United States,” said Jakubowicz at the New York premiere. “Those are the stereotypes you see in American movies and TV shows, but now you’re going to see a true legend: a Latino boxer who overcame all his demons and became an inspiration for an entire people. ” Roberto Durán Samaniego was born on 16 June 1951 in Guararé, a   drive south of Panama City, but was raised in El Chorrillo, a poor neighborhood on the water’s edge in the capital and walking distance to the mouth to the Panama Canal. During Durán’s childhood, tensions between the US and Panama were so hostile that authorities decided to build a wall  —   sound familiar?  —   between the Canal Zone and the capital in order to alleviate the tumultuous relationship between Panamanian residents and Americans who lived and worked inside the zonal area. Durán, a poor kid from the streets, remembers having to break into the prohibited zone in order to get mangoes from the trees so he could sell them and feed his family. “The best fruit was on the other side, so I would use a pair of pliers, cut the fence and climb up the trees to get the mangoes. ” American soldiers, after noticing the    breaking in, would fire shots of warning in the air to scare him away. “They knew we were kids so would only shoot blanks just to scare us. ”  His mother, Clara, raised him and his siblings as his father, Margarito, a   GI from Arizona who was stationed in Panama, left the family and returned to the states in 1954. After living almost his entire childhood without a father, it wasn’t until 1976 in California when they would reunite. In a 1980 interview with the Evening Independent, Margarito Durán recalls the meeting. “We embraced,” said Margarito. “We sat in a room at a hotel and it was no problem. ” Durán confirms the meeting and agrees it was an amicable encounter, but when I try to get him to talk more about his estranged father there is a sense of restraint, as if there is still a lot of resentment and pain still unresolved. He takes a photograph out of his wallet and shows it to me. It’s a black and white image of a young Durán with his father from that hotel meeting. In the image, both men are hugging and smiling, as if all was forgotten in one frozen memory. “The only good thing that my father ever did,” he says to me, “was that he once picked up a magazine and recognized who I was. ” Perhaps this is where the fighter was born. Not in the streets where he had to clean shoes, or sell newspapers, or even at Neco de La Guardia gymnasium where he learned how to box thanks to Nestor ‘Plomo’ Espinosa, and later joined by the legendary Arcel, who made him world champion in four different weight classes. These are all vital pieces of the puzzle that created the fighter inside the ring, but the inner rage and the   aggression he possessed, that is something that cannot be taught. It can only be experienced, and for Durán, it all began with his father.  Durán is perhaps best known for the infamous “No Más” rematch with Sugar Ray Leonard in 1980 after he’d won their first meeting. Near the end of the eighth round Durán, clearly losing the fight, turns around and allegedly mutters the words, “no more” to the referee. There have been many pieces on the subject including a 30 for 30 documentary and our own investigation, and Durán himself, as he mentions in the ESPN doc, denies he ever said those words, but instead it was the ref, Octavio Meyran, who muttered them after Durán put his hands up and refused to fight. Either way, it was Manos de Piedra who was mentally beaten and stopped the fight, regardless whether the words were said or not. The movie also goes into detail, including the fact that he was in poor physical condition, had little time to make weight due to his ferocious appetite and that the fight was poorly scheduled between Don King and his promoter, the millionaire Carlos Eleta.  Perhaps something that is more important and is often forgotten in the memory of the boxing fan is the close bond that Durán and Leonard have built since their bouts and how they became close friends. There was a beautiful moment at the New York premiere when right before the screening, Durán and Leonard embraced each other and the entire audience stood up and applauded. “This is something that people forget,” says Durán. “I never said ‘no más’ and me and Sugar are great friends. ” Durán wanted me to know that he was extremely proud of the film as it’s a testament to how much people validate what he has done for the sport, but there are certain parts which he was less keen on. “I’m very happy with the movie and Edgar Ramirez did a fantastic job. He’s a great actor,” he says. “But I didn’t always like the way they made me and my wife (powerfully played by   actress, Ana de Armas) look sometimes. There are scenes when she is smoking and drinking and she doesn’t do either, she never has. Also, they often made me look like a womanizer and that I insulted Sugar’s wife in front of her before our first fight. None of that happened. ”  I asked the director Jonathan Jakubowicz about these concerns. “First of all, there are stories about Jake La Motta and how he hated Raging Bull after seeing it for the first time, so if Durán’s biggest problem with the movie is that Fula was smoking and drinking, I’ll take it,” jokes the    director. “But to address the point, this movie is not just about Roberto Durán, it also examines Fula’s story, specifically after that fight in New Orleans and how she had to deal with a depressed man, someone who didn’t want to leave the house for three months or do anything. So it wasn’t just Durán who was broken, it was also his wife. So for us, the smoking and drinking was a creative choice that was made because it showed the distance and depressed state that she was in at the time. ”  Regarding the insults aimed at Leonard’s wife which Durán categorically denies, Jakubowicz stands firm. “Listen, I want people to know that aside from a filmmaker I am also an investigative journalist and I interviewed Sugar Ray Leonard on this very subject. We talked about it on more than one occasion and every time he tells me this story you can see the anger building within him. I also talked to Angelo Dundee (Leonard’s renowned trainer, who died in 2012) a few months before he sadly passed away and he also confirmed the story. I think Durán is perhaps repenting what happened and wishes to forget about it as it can’t be easy to see your entire life  —   the good and the bad  —   on the big screen. ” We may never know the exact details of what happened nor we may truly be able to fully understand the complexities of a fighter who has been through so much both inside and out of the ring. One thing is for sure, Roberto Durán, the kid from the slums of Panama who became the greatest lightweight on the planet, has never been perfect as his temperament has always represented a   sword, both his greatest ally and most dangerous enemy. “Durán is a man made of flesh and bones,” says Jakubowicz. “And all his demons are part of what made him a great boxer and in beating them is what specifically makes him a human being and a hero. And this is what Latin Americans need, we need someone who’s made of flesh and bones, a hero who knows what it’s like to also be imperfect. We need real heroes just like him. ” Just as we finish talking, Durán enters the room, elated because he has just found the famous iPod with 3, 500 songs. ‘You have no idea how happy I am to have found this,” he tells us. “Do you know how many songs it holds?” he asks. I do know, but I still want him to tell me.

David Cameron urges Europe to remain united against Russian threat
Europe must remain united in the face of the threat from Russia, David Cameron has warned, amid fears that Britain’s withdrawal from the EU will weaken resolve to stand up to Vladimir Putin. Speaking at the Nato summit in Warsaw on Saturday, the prime minister said there had to be a “  dialogue” with Moscow to prevent any “misunderstanding or miscalculation” leading to conflict. At the same time he stressed that the EU and the alliance needed to be prepared to stand firm in face of any fresh aggression by Russia following its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.  His comments were made after President François Hollande said France regarded Russia as a partner, “not a threat” and that Nato had no role in determining what Europe’s relations with Moscow should be.  Cameron told a news conference: “Of course we must have a dialogue with Russia  —   there are many issues we need to discuss with Russia, not least the situation in Syria.  “But there was a very strong consensus that we need to have that dialogue from a position of unity and strength over the issue of Ukraine. Boundaries are being redrawn in Europe by force by one power and Europe and Nato must be strong against that. “We are not seeking confrontation with Russia. We are working to prevent it so we will continue to pursue a   approach of deterrence and dialogue. We must engage in a   dialogue with Russia to avoid misunderstanding or miscalculation. ”  After Nato leaders confirmed plans on Friday to station four new battalions numbering around 4, 000 troops  —   including 650 British personnel  —   in eastern Europe, Cameron said the   council would meet next week for the first time in many months in an attempt to ensure the deployments did not create new friction.  Cameron also confirmed that Britain is to send an additional 50 troops to Afghanistan in a training and mentoring role while extending the mission of the 450 already there to help shore up the Afghan security forces.  It followed an announcement by Barack Obama on Wednesday that the remaining 8, 400 US troops in the country are to stay on for the rest of his presidency in the face of the worsening security situation. Speaking on Saturday at his last Nato summit before he steps down in January, Obama pledged the United States’   military commitment to ensuring security in Europe and defending its allies.  The US president said the western defence alliance had agreed on the most significant reinforcement of its collective defence since the cold war by agreeing to deploy forces in the Baltic states and Poland in response to Russia’s seizure of Crimea from Ukraine. “What will never change [is the] unwavering commitment of the United States to the security and defence of Europe,” he said. His comments were made against the backdrop of a presidential election campaign in which the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, has called Nato “obsolete” and suggested US allies should take care of their own defence.

Volkswagen sued in three US states over diesel emissions cheating
Three US states are suing Volkswagen alleging that bosses knew the automaker’s cars had been engineered to cheat US pollution tests and had concluded that “breaking the law and risking the imposition of fines was an acceptable cost of doing business”. New York, Massachusetts and Maryland have filed lawsuits alleging that former VW chief executive Martin Winterkorn and other top executives were involved in a campaign of “systematic cheating and deception” to mislead US regulators over the emissions of its diesel cars. An   lawsuit filed by New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman on Tuesday alleges that VW had been fiddling with technology to reduce the appearance of its cars emissions as far back as 1999. The company went on to develop bespoke software, termed a “defeat device” that allowed its cars to produce up to 40 times as much pollution on the roads than under strict US emissions test conditions. The lawsuit claims Winterkorn and VW’s former global head of marketing, Christian Klingler, knew by spring 2014 “of the existence of unlawful defeat devices and did nothing to prevent both Audi and Volkswagen from repeatedly deceiving regulators”. Current VW CEO Matthias Müller is also alleged to have been aware of the issue.  The lawsuit claims that “ultimately, Volkswagen and Audi decided not to expend the time and money necessary to  ” the cars and decided “to employ   defeat device software”. Schneiderman said the allegations “reveal a culture of deeply rooted corporate arrogance, combined with a conscious disregard for the rule of law or the protection of public health and the environment”. “Substantial penalties must be imposed on the Volkswagen companies, above and beyond the amount they have to pay to make American consumers whole. ” The lawsuits come despite VW agreeing a $14. 7bn settlement with federal regulators and owners. Volkswagen spokeswoman Jeannine Ginivan criticized the decision by the states to file suit, noting the company has already agreed to spend billions of dollars to address all environmental harms from the excess emissions. The states’ claims “are essentially not new and we have been addressing them in our discussions with US federal and state authorities,” Ginivan said. “It is regrettable that some states have decided to sue for environmental claims now. ”

Five things we learned from the first trailer for Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk
There are very few Hollywood   who could have made Dunkirk. The cinemagoing public is not crying out for an epic war film about the desperate evacuation of Allied troops at the peak of Hitler’s hold on Europe in May and June 1940. But Christopher Nolan doesn’t make turkeys: this is the director of the Dark Knight trilogy, of     thriller Inception, and of the equally far out space adventure Interstellar. His movies make money  —   more than $4. 2bn (£3. 3bn) at the global box office  —   and studio Warner Bros has duly stumped up the cash for what is expected to be the most ambitious historical war movie since the glory years of Steven Spielberg and Oliver Stone. Nolan was even reportedly given $5m to spend on a vintage Nazi war plane, which he is said to have cheerfully smashed to smithereens for the film’s denouement. Dunkirk stars a cavalcade of British and Irish talent, from Tom Hardy and Mark Rylance to Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy and . .. ahem . .. Harry Styles from One Direction. Here are five takeaways from the first trailer proper. As if it were not bad enough for the allied troops to be surrounded by the armies of the Third Reich in a small corner of northern France, the Nazi blighters are scattering leaflets highlighting the end of all hope over the   villages and towns of Normandy, then bombing our chaps as they sit helpless on the beach awaiting rescue. Thankfully, the propaganda artists responsible have foolishly also included the gleaming shores of Albion on their nasty little map, thereby giving hope to both the poor doomed soldiers of Blighty, not to mention Nolan’s audience. Poor Cillian Murphy. Thrown out of a British ship, then pulled from the waters against all odds by a kindly gentleman in a tiny fishing boat. Farewell Nazi hordes, hello Blighty. We’ll be wrapped up warm in a Dover pub with a pint of something tepid by dinner time. But what’s that? Rylance is taking our hero back to France, returning him to the heart of darkness, death and destruction. Nolan’s hardly known for his grasp of comedy, but this scene appears to be unintentionally hilarious, as if the trailer has somehow warped momentarily into the wartime gallows humour of   or Blackadder Goes Forth. Still, at least it looks like the incomparable Murphy might be getting a proper lead part for once, after taking countless supporting roles for the   maestro of widescreen cinema. In case that Nazi map hadn’t made things abundantly clear, Ken is here to illustrate exactly how near  —   yet horribly far  —   the Brits and their allies are from English soil. “You can practically see it from here,” he tells a minion, usefully. Branagh also reveals there are 400, 000 men on the Dunkirk beaches awaiting rescue. Some are so shellshocked they appear to be walking into the sea to their apparent deaths. There has been palpable excitement among hardcore Directioners that    Harry Styles is making his big screen debut in Dunkirk. But if the foppish singer is being set up for Hollywood heroics, Nolan has a funny way of showing it. There’s poor Harry, apparently drowning in the English channel as Spitfires and Hurricanes battle with the Luftwaffe in the skies. This never happened to the Spice Girls. The combination of Nolan’s eye for extravagant spectacle, Hoyte van Hoytema’s searing cinematography and Hans Zimmer’s gloomily beguiling, gorgeously resonant and typically minimalist score suggests Dunkirk could be a homegrown answer to Spielberg’s relentlessly torrid paean to American second world war heroism, a brutally epic exploration of British pluck, duty and desperation in the face of Hitler’s ghastly might.

’It’s not right’: mothers and daughters see own struggles reflected in Hillary Clinton
  Hillary Clinton made much of her relationship with her mother and daughter when she launched her campaign for the Democratic nomination in 2015. A year later, before she took the stage at the 2016 Democratic convention to accept that nomination, she was introduced by her daughter, along with a short, Shonda   video that delved into her relationship with her mother. At myriad events in between and since, Clinton has consistently positioned herself as a daughter, a mother and a grandmother  —   arguably at least as prominently as she has positioned herself as a former first lady, a former US senator and a former secretary of state. Mark Penn, an adviser to Clinton’s unsuccessful 2008 presidential campaign, once told Clinton to   her gender because Americans “do not want someone who would be the first mama” he likely would not recognize the   campaign Clinton has been running in 2016.  She took his advice, and split the women’s vote with Barack Obama in the 2008 primaries that she eventually lost, while in 2016, by contrast, she has had a consistent, overwhelming lead among women.  Penn, it seems, was  : perhaps voters don’t want a “first mama” but many female voters identify with the ways in which Clinton’s relationship with her mother, her daughter and her granddaughter influence her life. And, in what is more than a little problematic for the Trump campaign, they identify with her experiences being a woman in a man’s world, and with being criticized over problems men will never have to face. In the swing state of Pennsylvania, we asked families of women  —   Clinton supporters all  —   to talk about why they support her candidacy and how they identify with her experiences as a woman in the workforce and as a mother and grandmother at home. Polly Frey, a    former    mother and current furniture saleswoman in between jobs, lives with her daughter in the Philadelphia exurbs, and said she certainly sees herself in Clinton. “Being a new grandmother, definitely, it makes her more human and more attractive to me, how she would handle things,” she explained. “I worry about so much more now than I did with my kids, because you know what’s going on and you want to prepare them for what’s ahead and hope that they turn out to be   moral, generous  —   all the things you would want in a human, which sometimes we don’t see in some of the candidates. ” Her daughter, Raina Murdock, is an IT professional who just turned 43 and has two children: Dexter, age four, and Meadow, one. Murdock said, tearing up: “The one thing that I think is kind of cool, Meadow being the age she is, she’s not going to know any different” than that a woman can be president. “There’s the quote where, it’s like Madeleine Albright’s granddaughter or something saying, ‘Well, isn’t a woman always secretary of state?’ That might be how Meadow feels about the president, and that’s pretty cool. ” “It’ll be second nature,” said Frey. “She won’t see the limits that we’ve all seen,” replied Murdock. In the Philadelphia suburbs, Olga McHugh, who left a career to care for her daughters and is now helping to care for her new grandchild, called Hillary Clinton a “daily topic” in conversations with her daughters. She, too, empathizes with how being a grandmother can change your worldview. “As a new grandmother, I understand things a little differently, see things differently now,” she said. “And anyone who’s involved with their children and now is a grandparent, you will look at the future differently. You have to. ” Her daughter Emily Stine, who cut down to working   for a healthcare billing company after the birth of her son, was glad to hear Clinton focusing on her family. “I’m glad to hear Hillary talking about her relationship with her mother, and Chelsea and her granddaughter. “But I don’t understand why we don’t also want every candidate to talk about their relationship with their mother and father and their children and grandchildren,” she added. “It’s just as important for a male candidate as for a female candidate. “With all women, you end up focusing on: how nice is she?” she continued. “Does she get along with other women? Does she get along with men? Do men like her? Do women like her? It seems totally irrelevant to me in terms of: are you able to work with people in general to get something accomplished?” Julianna McHugh, who works   in early childhood education and   with her sister’s company and at the family’s church to make ends meet, said she hated the focus on women’s perceived friendliness. She said that she had had men complain about her lack of a smiling “resting” face since she was a young child, when a male teacher mocked her poker face. “My regular face is not a smile,” she said. “And he was frustrated by this, and infuriated by this, and bullied me. “It was the most demeaning, horrible thing. And I feel like that would not have been done to a male student. ”  Olga, her mother, abhors the same double standard. “I think Hillary  —   I’m hoping that she  —   has a good enough handle on the fact that women are complicated, but we can be many facets and be very contributing without smiling our way through and having to wear a certain type of dress. ” In north Philadelphia, Rainah Chambliss, a    administrative associate and songwriter, talked about the double standards for men and women with her daughter Aysha Chambliss, a    student and receptionist, and her mother, Koker, who called herself an “artistic messenger”. “Women have done so many great and powerful things throughout history,” said Rainah Chambliss. “But it’s still almost like we have to be domesticated. Even when we get into the White House. “It’s hard,” she added. “Being a woman and dealing with certain situations, it’s tough to look at. ” “Women are held to a certain standard,” her daughter Aysha said. “It’s not right, but it’s just the way it is, I guess. ” But she thought that having a female candidate for the presidency was progress. “Growing up, I don’t think I ever thought it was possible,” she said. “So to see that it is possible, that now that the sky’s the limit, so to speak, that’s kind of amazing. ” Koker said she was sad that her daughter and granddaughter still faced discrimination because of their gender. “I expected that we would all be seen as equals as we ought to be seen” by now. “Trump is being held to a lower standard because he is a lower standard” she said. “And he shouldn’t even be running for president. ” Rainah Chambliss agreed. “So Hillary’s the frontrunner, she is the candidate for the Democratic party. She had a husband who had some indiscretions  —   her husband had some indiscretions  —   so we’re going to hear about all this stuff played out again. “It had nothing to do with Hillary herself,” she added, “But it’s going to come up because, ‘Well, why did she stay with her husband?’ or ‘Why didn’t she get upset and go cuss out Monica Lewinsky?’ “Yet we have a Republican candidate who’s been married three times. ” Back in the exurbs, Frey and Murdock had a lot of thoughts about Republicans playing up some of the darker periods of the Clinton marriage. “The    cheating situation,” said Murdock. “Mom lived through that. ” “I lived through both sides of that,” Frey agreed. “I stayed and stayed and then when I did leave a marriage after   years, one reason I left is I don’t want my kids to think this is OK,” she said, tearing up. “I certainly don’t like the idea that they’re saying that Hillary’s a pushover, whatever, because she put up with that,” she added. “Everyone has to hear their own drummer and do what works for them. ” Her daughter, Murdock, agreed. “I do think there absolutely are double standards for women. I was talking about her being a    mom, and how that was really great, and me being a career person, there are people on both sides of those camps that put the other down. “It’s like, ‘C’mon, ladies, let’s stop putting each other down,’” she added. “We’ve all made our own choices for our own reasons and there’s nothing wrong with one versus the other. It’s kind of who you are and what’s best for you. ” Olga McHugh, who keenly remembers the social slights she faced when she left the business world to care for her children, said: “We really as a society devalue women that decide to take care of their families or stay home. And that’s carried over to women, whether it’s   pay or whether it’s ‘Well, she can be secretary of state but it’s still not as good as the man secretary of state’. ”  Her daughter, Julianna, sees it too. “I hope that having a female president will help bring more respect to all of the occupations that are filled with women who aren’t getting the same respect that a male would, in the same place, doing the same thing. “It’s never good enough, for some reason, and I don’t know how we change that,” Olga added. “Well, I guess having a woman president will help change that pretty quickly. ”

As a teacher, I know plagiarism when I see it
As a writing teacher at Boston University I can usually detect plagiarism. When you read someone’s writing week after week, sometimes all it takes is a suspiciously elegant turn of phrase or a sophisticated syntactical structure to raise a red flag. Most students know about the perils of plagiarism by the time they get to college. Others may not. They ask legitimate questions, such as: “If    made her point so well, why should I put it in my own words?” And the answer, of course, is that you don’t have to.  If something is powerfully or perfectly put, use it  —   just be sure to cite it. Quotation marks are small symbols, but they mean a lot. A bibliography comes at the end of the paper, but that doesn’t make it an afterthought. Otherwise, one would assume the student wrote those perfect words, that they’re a product of the student’s brain. Plagiarism is generally regarded as the most egregious form of academic misconduct, and those who crib others’ words can get expelled.  Set aside the awkwardness of being accused of plagiarism in a speech about values. Forget that it’s unclear who wrote the speech  —   Melania Trump told Matt Lauer she did, but now that things have gone south the campaign communications team has taken responsibility. Never mind that were the shoe on the other foot, Michelle Obama would be ceaselessly maligned with both partisan smears and racial ones. Let’s focus on one simple fact: plagiarizing is lying. If it turns out the Melania Trump speech is guilty of that, then that’s pretty serious, regardless of whether it was written by her or a speechwriter.  After I confront a student about plagiarism, I generally get one of three responses. 1) I didn’t know or understand I was plagiarizing 2) I didn’t plagiarize or 3) I plagiarized (even if unintentionally) and I’m sorry. “I didn’t know” doesn’t fly. Even the students who didn’t understand plagiarism before my class quickly learn about it during discussions, exercises, example reviews and links to online   and plagiarism checkers. I never accuse a student of plagiarizing unless I have proof, almost always in the form of sources easily found by Googling a few choice phrases. For college students, the internet is both the best and the worst thing to happen to research papers. It’s so easy to lift passages, but so easy to get caught. We’ve all got access to videos and transcripts of previous speeches, and with the help of sharp journalists with long memories and social media, it’s easy to prove plagiarism outside the classroom. By now, you’ve probably seen    transcripts or videos that show not just that the words used were “common words” as Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign manager, asserts. It strikes me that they are the same words.  Trump’s speechwriter, Jason Miller, has said that Melania’s speech included “fragments that reflected her own thinking”. Exactly. That’s the definition of plagiarism: taking fragments of someone else’s work and passing it off as one’s own. If it turns out that Michelle Obama’s speech reflected Melania’s thoughts, Melania should acknowledge it.  The Trump campaign calls the charges of plagiarism “absurd” and “crazy” as though this has all been cooked up. But, as an educator, there are all sorts of parallels with plagiarism that I’ve dealt with in my own classroom. If Melania Trump were my student, we’d be meeting with the dean this morning and she’d be getting an “F” in my class.  The Trump campaign says that the stakes were too high for something like this to happen, that no one would deliver a plagiarized speech “in front of 35 million people. ” But my students often say to me, “this paper’s worth 50% of my grade  —   I would never have plagiarized. ” That makes the plagiarism even more   but it doesn’t make it not plagiarism.  And the kicker: it’s Clinton’s fault. Apparently, this is what happens “when a woman threatens Hillary Clinton”. I’m wary of scapegoating  —   I see it all the time when I call out plagiarism. “You’re doing this because you don’t like me,” students sometimes say. But I’m not the one who plagiarized. I’m the one whose job it is to assess students’ work, to hold them accountable not just for substance and style, but for ethical behavior. In this case, we  —   all of us who care about the future of the United States and who care about truth  —   are the assessors. It doesn’t matter that Melania Trump or the campaign speechwriter isn’t enrolled in class, trying to get a good grade. Plagiarism is an even more serious offense outside of the classroom, when people are trying to sell themselves and their values  —   especially their honesty and integrity  —   to those who would take their lead. Just like with my students, accepting responsibility for plagiarism is preferable to denying responsibility. In this case, denial of obvious wrongdoing is a lie upon a lie. Regardless of whether or not the similarity between the two speeches was an honest mistake, the Trump campaign should own it  —   with an honest apology.

Don’t judge Ben-Hur by the 2016 version
Please don’t call it  . The   remake of   is the 2016 blockbuster season’s biggest disappointment, with losses projected to reach $120m. The film had a $100m production budget, and studios usually dole out at least half production for marketing  —   and often more in the case of   hits like  . It’s a bad moment to be an accountant at MGM. It wasn’t always thus:   was once one of Hollywood’s most reliable   with no fewer than five adaptations since 1907  —   two are preserved in the US Library of Congress. The 1880 novel, written by civil war general Lew Wallace, has been adapted into a   TV miniseries by ABC, a Broadway play of similar length, and no fewer than four theatrical films, including the 1959 classic with its notoriously dangerous chariot races. Wallace’s book was the first work of fiction to be blessed by a pope, Leo XIII, and Wallace decided that for religious reasons no one should adapt it. After nine years of promises that they would do it justice, enterprising theater producers turned his head. With an initial, immensely popular stage production, the novel was off to the races, as it were. Director: Sidney OlcottProduction budget: $500, adjusted to $12, 851 in 2016Eventual court settlement: $25, 000, adjusted to $642, 589 in 2016, At 15 minutes long, the film is certainly the shortest adaptation of the novel’s hundreds of pages in terms of film history, though, it might be even more significant than the 1959 classic because it created the concept of movie rights.  An elaborate play version had been a success in 1899, possibly because the spectacle had included horses on treadmills and the producing Kalem Company worked hard to replicate it, even featuring actors from the 1890 cast of the play. Wallace had died two years before the film’s release, but his publisher, Harper  Brothers, still held the rights to the book. The company sued the   who had simply shot their favorite scenes from the book. Box office records for the film weren’t available, but the film’s success made an impression: the resulting infringement suit went to the supreme court. The result, a landmark 1911 ruling, created contemporary copyright standards when the justices said that   needed permission to adapt works under copyright. Films weren’t taken particularly seriously at the time, but the justices said that the film’s advertisement had relied on the book’s success and its makers were wrong to have hitched a ride on Wallace’s coattails.  Kalem had to pay Harper a hefty $25, 000, according to Kevin Brownlow’s history of silent film, The Parade’s Gone By. Director Sidney Olcott went on to film the world’s first   movie, From the Manger to the Cross, in Palestine the next year. Appropriately, both the 1907 film and novel are now in the public domain. Production budget: $3m, adjusted to $41. 2m in 2016Box office gross: $9m, adjusted to $123. 8m in 2016, William Young’s   stage adaptation of   finally wore out its welcome in 1917, with a sixth and final run on Broadway. It played at Oscar Hammerstein’s Manhattan Opera House, which is now a Quiznos.  A scant eight years later, MGM released a   film version starring Mexican American Ramon Novarro, who played opposite Francis X Bushman as Messala. The film was the   grossing feature of the year behind King Vidor’s The Big Parade. The   paid $600, 000 for the rights this time around, in addition to fees to build some 30 ships for the pitched naval battle sequences. The film shot in Rome under its   ruler, Benito Mussolini. The fascist leader extended every courtesy and they returned the favor  —   “Mussolini was much admired in Hollywood,” Brownlow writes  —   until the dictator learned of the vast discrepancy between pay rates for Hollywood stagehands and his country’s own carpenters. He then declined to intervene in labor strikes. Production budget: $15. 75m ($130. 25m) Box office gross: $146. 9m worldwide ($1. 2bn) At the time the most expensive film ever made, William Wyler’s 1959 film ran 212 minutes from a screenplay whipped into shape by the novelist Gore Vidal.  The film began inauspiciously in 1952, with a script so hacky that Wyler, who had worked as an assistant director on the 1925 film, initially turned it down. It then saw years of setbacks: the dangerous   sequence alone cost $150, 000, and in 1958 producer Sam Zimbalist died on set, aged 57.  But the finished product, with Charlton Heston as the lead and Vidal’s script still pored over today for the way he dodged Hollywood censors, is an enduring piece of movie history. Its box office receipts would make it the    film ever, adjusted for inflation, with $70m domestically and more than twice that across the globe. Production budget: $100mBox office gross (to date): $42. 9m, Directed by   director Timur Bekmambetov, the most recent remake bears the distinct stamp of two producers: Mark Burnett, an evangelical Christian entertainment mastermind, and his wife Roma Downey, who also produced Sarah Palin’s reality show and The Bible miniseries. Its ambitions were grand: the film’s producers had wanted to shoot chariot race scenes in the actual Circus Maximus until Italian officials called it off. Ultimately, critics pounced on bad editing, poor computer effects, and a dearth of ideas. No property in the public domain is immune to   producers, and   has strayed a long way from its original papal endorsement.  There’s a 2009 “monutainment” stage spectacle  a 2003 DVD cartoon version  —   the final film of Heston’s long career  —   and a Game of   version called The Legend of   from the Asylum, the    “mockbuster” studio behind the cable Sharknado series. But the most interesting    film is probably the Coen brothers’ screwball comedy Hail, Caesar! an   film with one foot in the Busby Berkeley musical craze and the other in the intrigue of LA noir. The film follows a   studio fixer named Eddie Mannix, far more sympathetic on film than in life, through a series of fictional films, including a Biblical epic. Hail, Caesar! has everything up to and including Vidal’s gay subtext subplot, as well as some nuanced ideas about socialism and religion. It   Bekmambetov’s remake by $20m.

Will Rick Perry’s pro-wind power stance carry on in the Trump administration?
Environmental activists in Texas have stories to tell about Rick Perry, who was governor of the state for 14 years. Jim Marston, the Texas head of the Environmental Defense Fund, remembers when Perry, seemingly out of the blue, signed an executive order   coal plant air permits in October 2005. “We scratched our head,” Marston said. “What the heck is this about?” The answer quickly emerged. A Texas coal company, TXU Corp, wanted to build 11 new coal plants in the state. Pollutants spewed by the facilities would in sum have surpassed the total emissions of dozens of other entire states. But the utility had the governor’s ear. Between 2001 and 2011, it made $633, 575 in campaign contributions to Perry, Mother Jones has reported.  “Not only did he try to help a donor. He tried to do it illegally,” Marston said. “A judge ruled that that order was illegal. “Texas politicians often help their donors but this was as bold and audacious in ignoring basic ethics rules as I’ve seen in my years as a lawyer, going back to 1978. I’ll let you draw the connection to draining the swamp. ” That was a reference to one of the slogans repeated on the campaign trail by Donald Trump, whose decision to nominate Perry to head the Department of Energy has resulted in new scrutiny of Perry’s environmental record. The department does not have a lead role in setting environmental conservation policy, but it makes research grants and participates in energy infrastructure policy in ways that can steer the national energy strategy. Trump’s promise to reinvigorate the coal industry, his dismissal of renewable energy resources such as wind power, his climate change denialism and his nomination of the country’s top oil executive for secretary of state all have been taken by conservationists as discouraging signs for the future of sustainable energy. But the nomination of Perry, who presided as governor over an explosion of wind power infrastructure in Texas, has been taken in some corners as a potentially encouraging sign that the United States is not on the verge of rolling back 46 years of green progress since Earth Day was first celebrated. The idea is that Perry  —   who has firsthand experience of how wind power can create jobs, make money for landowners and drive energy prices down for consumers  —   could help guide the Trump administration in the direction of renewables. “I look forward to engaging in a conversation about the development, stewardship and regulation of our energy resources, safeguarding our nuclear arsenal, and promoting an American energy policy that creates jobs and puts America first,” Perry said in accepting Trump’s nomination. The success of the Texas experiment with wind power under Perry is not disputed. In 2006, the governor signed legislation that raised benchmarks for the production of wind power and promoted environmentally sensitive siting for transmission lines. The legislation is credited with creating tens of thousands of jobs in the wind industry and attracting tens of billions of dollars in investment. “Here you have a   fossil     energy enthusiast,” Michael Webber, deputy director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin, said of Perry in an interview. “And you had this wind opportunity. A lot of wind in Texas. A lot of people with a lot of cheap, flat, windy land who like the idea of making money off their land with the wind. And you have an attitude to build stuff, and for wind to really get to market you have to build hundreds of kilometers of transmission lines. “And Perry was there when it happened, and not just sort of idly sitting by, but actually helpful when it came time to build the power lines. ” “Perry signed that and it worked,” agreed Marston. “It wasn’t his idea. He did push forward with that. He gets some credit there. ” In multiple descriptions of the Texas wind experiment given to the Guardian, however, Perry emerged not as an environmentalist in any meaningful sense of the word, but as a chief executive with an eye on growing the economy and keeping business happy. “It looks like his heart is not really in the climate science,” said Webber. “He doesn’t really care. But his heart is in economic opportunity, one way or another. ” Whatever Perry’s hidden environmental sympathies may be, his staying power at the top of Texas politics  —   he was the   governor in state history  —   indicates a basic loyalty to the top energy interest in the state, which for decades fielded a national football league team called the Oilers.  Texas produces more than three times as much crude oil as any other state. It is also far and away the national leader in total carbon dioxide emissions, producing 641m metric tons in 2013, compared with 353m metric tons emitted by   California, according to the US energy information administration. Texas Oil and Gas Association president Todd Staples hailed Perry’s selection to lead the department of energy, in a statement obtained by the San Antonio Business Journal. “Rick Perry would be a breath of fresh air as he would restore a   approach to the Department of Energy that will benefit our environment, our economy and our future,” Staples said. “Unlike the current administration, Perry would be committed to protecting the environment while making Americans less dependent on other nations for our energy needs. ” As head of the Department of Energy, Perry’s main charge would be to manage the country’s nuclear weapons stockpile and radioactive waste. The department also extends loans for energy research and development and takes a role in grid modernization, science education and environmental cleanup. As a candidate for president in 2012, Perry proposed eliminating the agency  —   although when the moment came for him to mention it at a presidential debate, he forgot the department’s name. Prior to his recent turn on Dancing with the Stars, that “oops” debate moment was perhaps what Perry was best known for to the national audience. Webber pointed out that Trump has described a plan to rebuild the national infrastructure, and Perry has experience building transmission lines and other renewable energy infrastructure. “If Perry plays a role in cheerleading that, or in encouraging building out the transmission infrastructure, well, that’d make it a lot easier to take sunshine from the desert   or wind from the great plains states, and move it to the coast,” Webber said. But there is concern that the job of energy secretary could overwhelm Perry, who has no background in nuclear issues, before he gets to talking about transmission lines.  “There’s some technical stuff at DoE,” said Marston. “Nuclear waste, nuclear arsenal. Grants. If you judge what he’s going to do in the future by what he’s done in the past, I’d be very worried about somebody being able to learn the details, care what the experts say and act on it. So I think we’ll have a lot of decisions that are made  . “You’re sometimes surprised. There could be a surprise. But it would be a surprise. ”

Emma Stone and Alicia Vikander set for rival Agatha Christie biopics
The Danish Girl star Alicia Vikander and The Amazing  ’s Emma Stone have both been lined up to play a young Agatha Christie in biopics being developed at rival Hollywood studios. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Vikander has been approached by Sony to play the celebrated crime author in her formative years as a “ ” unhappy with traditional    expectations. Stone, on the other hand, has been pencilled in for Paramount’s take on Christie’s “missing” 11 days in 1926  —   a subject already covered in Michael Apted’s 1979 film Agatha, which starred Vanessa Redgrave and Dustin Hoffman. The resurgence of interest in Christie follows a flurry of interest from   in getting film versions of the writer’s work off the ground. A forthcoming adaptation of her 1934 yarn Murder on the Orient Express has Kenneth Branagh in the director’s chair and Angelina Jolie in the cast, is due to start shooting this summer and will be released in 2017. A version of the 1939 mystery And Then There Were None was successfully aired on BBC1 at Christmas, and leading British film compnay Working Title are moving ahead with a feature film adaptation to be directed by The Imitation Game’s Morten Tyldum. However, a Julian   adaptation of Crooked House appears to have stalled, after an announcement in 2012 that Possession director Neil LaBute was on board. The current activity around Christie’s work is ascribed to Acorn Media’s purchase of a 64% stake in the Christie estate in 2013 from entertainment company Chorion, who themselves had bought the rights to Christie’s work in 1998. Chorion had overseen the reworking of the Miss Marple stories for TV  —   a series which began in 2004  —   but Acorn, who were the DVD distributors for Marple, are thought to have ambitions in the feature film arena. The last set of major   adaptations arrived in the   with a   cast coming together on Murder on the Orient Express in 1974 and Death on the Nile in 1978.  Any film adaptation of the writer’s work will also have to secure the approval of Christie’s descendants, who are thought to hold a 36% stake in the company that holds licensing rights.

Forget Brexit, Quitaly is Europe’s next worry
First it was Grexit, then it was Brexit. Now the looming threat for Europe is Quitaly, the fear that Italy might decide it has had enough of the single currency and go back to the lira. Put simply, Italy’s economy is floundering and has been for the past two decades during which time there has been virtually no growth and Italian goods have become less and less competitive in export markets. Sluggish growth and high levels of unemployment are reflected in the high level of   loans that are now hobbling Italian banks. Potential bad debts have almost doubled to €360bn (£300bn) in the past five years and now account for 18% of all outstanding loans. What is clear, though, is that the   loans reflect a   economy. They are the symptom of the problem and not its cause. Unlike Greece, Ireland or Spain, Italy did not go through a period of economic boom before the Great Recession of  . Instead, its performance has been unremittingly poor. The economy is 10% smaller than it was before the financial crisis and as a result unemployment is high, especially in the poorer southern half of the country. In the days before it joined the euro, Italy would have been able to make itself more competitive by devaluing the lira. That option is no longer available. The risk, therefore, is obvious. Europe suffers a fresh slowdown as a result of the shock imparted by Brexit. An already weak Italy suffers more than most and its banks start to fail. Small investors are told that European rules mean that they have to shoulder some of the losses. Matteo Renzi’s centre left government loses power and is replaced by the Five Star Movement, which has pledged to hold a referendum on leaving the euro. Given the state of the economy, Quitaly could not be ruled out. If it happened, the single currency would collapse.

Brothers charged in death of Nykea Aldridge, cousin of NBA’s Dwyane Wade
Chicago police said on Sunday two brothers had been charged with   murder in the shooting death of Nykea Aldridge, the cousin of NBA star Dwyane Wade, as she was walking to register her children for school. Authorities said    Darwin Sorrells Jr and    Derren Sorrells were charged on Sunday in the death of Aldridge. Police said the    mother of four was pushing a baby in a stroller near the school when two men walked up and fired shots at a third man but instead hit Aldridge in the head and arm. Police commander Brendan Deenihan said at a Sunday news conference the target was a driver who had just dropped off passengers in the neighborhood. Video of the incident exists, Dennihan said, but no weapon was recovered and police do not know where the weapon is. Shortly after the charges were announced, dozens gathered at a Chicago church for a prayer service in remembrance of Aldridge, whose parents, sister, nieces and nephews wept as they spoke about a woman they said was a gifted writer and “fighter of the family”. Aldridge’s mother, Diann, said her daughter’s life was “gone too soon” adding that she was a “little quiet storm of a daughter”. Jolinda Wade, pastor of the church and Dwyane Wade’s mother, called her niece a “a very, very special young lady” and said the family would hold on to their memories. At the news conference, Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson said the suspects were an example of the city’s problem with repeat offenders, which he has spoken about frequently in recent months.  Darwin Sorrells was sentenced to six years in prison in January 2013 on a gun charge and was released early on parole. Derren Sorrells is a known gang member who also was on parole, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. “They don’t care who they shoot and they don’t fear the consequences,” Guglielmi said, noting that about 1, 400 people drive 85% of the city’s gun violence. He added that Chicago is good at predicting who will be the perpetrators and the victims of gun violence. Chicago has been in the throes of a major increase in such violence, largely centered in a few south and west side neighborhoods, after years of seeing declines. This July alone, there were 65 homicides  —   the most that month since 2006. Wade, whose charitable organization, Wade’s World Foundation, does community outreach in the Chicago area, signed with the Chicago Bulls in July after 13 years with the Miami Heat. On Thursday he and his mother participated via satellite in an   town hall meeting on Chicago gun violence. Wade has reacted to his cousin’s death online, tweeting Friday: “My cousin was killed today in Chicago. Another act of senseless gun violence. 4 kids lost their mom for NO REASON. Unreal. #EnoughIsEnough. ” On Saturday morning, he tweeted: “The city of Chicago is hurting. We need more help more hands on deck. Not for me and my family but for the future of our world. The YOUTH!” In a following tweet, he added: “These young kids are screaming for help! !! #EnoughIsEnough”. In 2012, Wade’s nephew, Darin Johnson, was shot twice in the leg. He recovered. Aldridge’s death became the center of political controversy on Saturday, after Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, seemed to attempt to use it to appeal to African American voters. Appearing on CNN on Sunday, Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, sidestepped questions about the flow of guns into Illinois from his state. Chicago police have said more than half of the guns used in crimes come from out of state, including about 20% from Indiana.  Asked about the statistic, the Indiana governor instead brought up failing schools in Chicago and his running mate Donald Trump’s pledge to create jobs.

Champion Warriors storm back to beat Thunder and force dramatic Game 7
On the verge of elimination, Klay Thompson would not let the Golden State Warriors’ season die. And so he shot and he shot and he shot. Normally he has been the sidekick to MVP Steph Curry, but with Curry struggling for much of the Western Conference finals, it was Thompson who came though on Saturday, hitting an NBA playoffs record 11   in the Warriors   victory over Oklahoma City in Game 6. “Nobody wanted to [go home],” Thompson said after the game, his 41 points having silenced a roaring crowd in Oklahoma City’s Chesapeake Arena.  On the verge of elimination, Golden State, who set a league record with 73   wins, salvaged a season that was slipping away by overturning a   deficit with 5:00 left, and by doing something they hadn’t done much in the previous 5 ½ games: play defense. They held the Thunder to just one basket and three   in those final five minutes. Now the Warriors go back to Oakland’s Oracle Arena for Monday night’s Game 7, where they will be heavily favored to earn their   finals appearance. On the verge of elimination, Curry turned back into Curry. His struggles in the first games of the series disappeared on Saturday night when he hit two smooth, confident   in the final five minutes. The kind he used to make before the Thunder began knocking him around the court. He scored 10 points in that last burst, batted away Oklahoma City players’ passes, and looked everything like the player who had been missing the last two weeks. Just when the Warriors needed him. “About time we have a stretch where we opposed our will,” he later said. The Thunder, though, collapsed. This has been all too familiar a script for Oklahoma City in recent years. But the Thunder thought those days had passed. Behind new coach Billy Donovan, they had transformed themselves into a rugged defensive team that crushed the league’s most beautiful,   offense. Then it was gone. Oklahoma City began to miss the shots that had fallen earlier in the series. The Warriors became more aggressive defensively, and the Thunder’s Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook tried to force passes and shots late. What should have been a celebration on the way to a meeting with Cleveland in the finals tuned into a panicked rush to save the series. Under pressure, Oklahoma City fell apart. “We missed some shots and they got hot from three,” Durant said. But more than the Thunder’s   tumble, Game 6 will be remembered for Thompson’s  . “He was ridiculous,” Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. “His shooting was some of the most incredible shooting I will ever see. ” He hit shots from the corner. He hit shots off passes from the side. He hit shots seemingly without even looking and he even hit a a shot just two steps in from center court  —   normally Curry’s domain. He has always been one of the best shooters in the league, but as the guard who plays beside Curry, he is a second option, overshadowed by the MVP. On Saturday, the Warriors needed him to be Curry until Curry could find his missing shot. Even Curry shook his head later and said: “He made some great shots. ” On the verge of elimination, Thompson, and then Curry, came through. The Warriors were the Warriors again, and now with a trip back to Oakland that the Thunder do not want to make, Golden State suddenly seem back on the path to the finals once again.

Very hot drinks may cause cancer, but coffee does not, says WHO
The World Health Organisation has cleared coffee of causing cancer, but a detailed investigation has found that very hot drinks may be linked to cancer of the oesophagus, or gullet. Coffee was classified as a possible cause of cancer in 1991, but the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) which is part of WHO, has now reconsidered the evidence. It carried out a detailed review of the many studies published on the subject and found that coffee drinkers have no reason to worry. IARC also investigated the herbal drink mate, also known as chimarrão or cimarrón, which is widely consumed in South America, where oesophageal cancer is more common than in other parts of the world.  The experts found that mate was not a cause of cancer, but they believe the temperature at which it is drunk probably is  —   and that other very hot drinks could also be linked to oesophageal cancer. Mate is drunk at temperatures of more than 65C (149F) often through a metal straw. The scientists also looked at drinks including tea consumed at high temperatures in central Asia, China and Japan. “It is consumed very hot,” said IARC’s Dr Dana Loomis. “This led to interest in other hot drinks around the world. There seems to be an effect of temperature. “There is limited evidence in human studies, and limited evidence in animal studies, for the carcinogenicity of very hot drinks,” said Loomis. IARC produces what it calls monographs on the causes of cancer, which use classifications from group one, where the link is definite, as with smoking to group four, where there is probably no link.  The new monograph classifies hot drinks as group 2A, meaning they are “probably carcinogenic to humans”. Coffee and mate served cold are in group three, which means there is insufficient evidence to believe they cause cancer. IARC’s conclusions are published in the Lancet Oncology journal. Those who enjoy hot tea in Europe and the US probably do not need to worry, Loomis said. “It is important to recognise that hot drinks that were studied for the basis of this classification are perhaps a bit different from tea or coffee as consumed [in other parts of the world]  —   65C is quite hot. ” In European countries, coffee and tea are usually drunk at below 60C, he said, and milk is often added, which cools it. Tea in Iran and mate in South America are often drunk at 70C. “Mate is not only prepared very hot, but drunk through a metal straw that delivers it directly into the throat,” he said. Studies in animals have shown that very hot water can promote the growth of tumours. “It appears that there is thermal injury from exposure to hot liquids that is capable of leading to cancer of the oesophagus,” he said. IARC’s classifications relate to the strength of the evidence for a causal association, rather than the frequency with which something causes cancer. This is why tobacco, which increases the risk of cancer   is in the same group as UV rays from sunbeds, which increase the risk of skin cancer  . The scientists found an inverse relationship between drinking coffee and certain types of cancer. The risk of developing liver cancer dropped by 15% for each cup of coffee drunk, while in breast cancer and endometrial   womb   cancer studies suggest there were fewer incidences among people who drank coffee than those who did not. Other factors could be responsible, however, and IARC does not consider that drinking coffee protects people from cancer.

Iraq’s parliament passes law banning alcohol
Iraq’s parliament has passed a law forbidding the import, production or selling of alcoholic beverages in a surprise move that angered many in the country’s Christian community who rely on the business. The law, passed late on Saturday night, imposes a fine of up to 25m Iraqi dinars (£17, 000) for anyone violating the ban. But it’s unclear how strictly the law would be enforced, and it could be struck down by the supreme court. Islam forbids the consumption of alcohol, but it has always been available in Iraq’s larger cities, mainly from shops run by Christians. Those shops are currently closed because of the Shia holy month of Muharram. Iraq’s parliament is dominated by Shia Islamist parties. The assembly announced the ban on its website but did not say how many lawmakers voted for or against it. Christian lawmaker Joseph Slaiwa said the “unjust” ban was slipped into a draft law regulating the income of municipal authorities without lawmakers being notified. The original article only called for imposing taxes on liquor stores and restaurants serving liquor, he said. “This ban is unconstitutional, as the constitution acknowledges the rights of   minorities and ethnic groups who live alongside Muslims in Iraq,” he said. “To those Muslim lawmakers, I say: ‘Take care of your religion and leave ours for us, we know how to deal with it’. ” He said some lawmakers will submit an appeal at the high federal court. The bill was proposed by Mahmoud   a judge and lawmaker from the State of Law coalition, the largest bloc in parliament. He insisted it was inkeeping with article 2 in the constitution, which prohibits any legislation that goes against Islam. “The constitution preserves democracy and the rights of   groups, but these rights must not violate the religion of Islam,” he said. “Some of the lawmakers’ vote was religiously motivated, but many others voted to avoid anything unconstitutional. ” Kirk Sowell, the publisher of the biweekly newsletter Inside Iraqi Politics, said the bill was clearly supported by Shia Islamists but came “as a bit of a surprise because it has not been a subject of major debate or discussion”. He said the executive branch could move to have the law overturned on procedural or other grounds, and the supreme court could strike it down. Other   countries have laws restricting alcohol, but only a few, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, enforce a complete ban. The Iraqi law was unlikely to be enforced in the largely autonomous Kurdish region, which is home to a sizeable Christian community. The bill comes as Iraq is waging a massive military operation to retake the northern city of Mosul from the Islamic State group. Isis brutally enforces a ban on alcohol, cigarettes and other drugs in the territory under its control. Iraqis debated the alcohol ban on social media, with many criticising lawmakers for ignoring more pressing concerns, such as the war against Isis, an economic crisis brought on by low oil prices, and the government’s own corruption and paralysis. A cartoon circulated online showing men with their backs turned on Mosul, shooting a bottle of liquor. Others expressed support for the ban and praised parliament for aligning the country’s laws with Islamic teachings.

Ryder Cup 2016: Tiger Woods may have adverse influence, claims Westwood
The first blow of the phoney war which always precedes a Ryder Cup has been landed by Lee Westwood, who has pointed towards the potentially “adverse” influence of Tiger Woods as a   of the USA. Woods has endured an infamously troublesome time as a Ryder Cup player but while injured this time, the USA captain Davis Love III asked him to become a member of the backroom staff. Westwood will play in his 10th Ryder Cup at Hazeltinein nine days’ time, with Europe seeking an unprecedented fourth win in a row. “I don’t know what impact there will be from having Tiger around,”  Westwood said to ESPN. com. “They have always struggled to find a partner for Tiger that’s been successful. He could have an adverse effect in the team room. People have always seemed to try to do too much when they have partnered him. It might be different if he’s one of the   you don’t know. “The captain is obviously building them up a lot and making a few interesting decisions. They have got a strong side and probably are favourites, but they haven’t won it for a while and they are playing in front of a home crowd. There is a lot of pressure on them. That is going to keep building in the next week or so and by the time the Ryder Cup comes around, it is going to be pretty intense for them. ” Westwood also referred to Love’s captaincy in 2012 at Medinah, and the handling of his wildcard picks this time, as being potentially significant. Four years ago Europe triumphed in memorable style as the hosts capitulated during the singles matches. “I don’t know if something went wrong on the Sunday or the team didn’t play very well for some reason, but that will be in the back of their minds,” the Englishman said. Westwood was similarly questioning of Love’s decision, thus far, not to pick Bubba Watson. The USA captain has one wildcard remaining, with Watson seemingly battling against Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger for the spot. “There seem to have been issues about team spirit and chemistry. Love has not picked Bubba Watson and I don’t know what that does for team spirit he was first outside the points qualification and is No7 in the world. ”

India claims dead soldier killed in Kashmir was mutilated by militants
India says the body of one of its soldiers killed in Kashmir on Friday night was “mutilated” by militants, who fled under cover of Pakistani fire. The accusation comes after a week of bloody clashes across the “line of control” in Kashmir in which 15 Pakistani and four Indian soldiers have been killed, according to Indian army officials. The soldier, identified as Manjeet Singh, was killed in a gunfight in Kupwara district near the ceasefire line that divides Indian and   Kashmir.  An army spokesperson told local media the soldier’s body had been “mutilated” in an unspecified way by the militants, who “managed to escape due to the covering fire provided to them from the Pakistan army posts”. “The despicable act of mutilating the jawan’s [junior soldier’s] body reflects the barbarism pervading in official and unofficial organisations in Pakistan,” the spokesperson added. The army said the incident would be “responded to appropriately”. Reports of the mutilation are likely to increase   in India towards its neighbour, which is already high after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in a September attack on an army base in Uri, another Kashmir town near the ceasefire border. India says Pakistan was implicated in the Uri attack, but Islamabad denies the charge. It prompted the unprecedented announcement by Delhi of a retaliatory strike on militant “launch pads” on the   side of Kashmir  —   though Islamabad also denies that any such attacks took place. India has also attempted to isolate Pakistan in the region, labelling it the “mothership of terrorism” and organising a boycott of a summit that was scheduled to be held in Islamabad in November.  An Indian soldier was reported to have been beheaded by Pakistani militants in 2013, triggering huge outrage among Indians and several border skirmishes between the two nuclear powers.

Morgan review – cranked-up Frankenstein from the family Scott
Coinciding with Mary Shelley’s birthday week, this Scott family affair  —   produced by Ridley for director son Luke  —   is another runout for the old story about scientists who create new life only to see it lurch bloodily away from them. Frosty risk assessor Kate Mara’s investigations into the mishandling of the eponymous hybrid intelligence (The Witch’s   Anya  ) permits Scott Jr a good hour of existential unease: is it the placid Morgan or her intemperate human overseers (Toby Jones, Michelle Yeoh, Paul Giamatti) who pose the greater threat to this shadowy corporation’s safe operation? Alas, once that question is resolved, the film turns into a passably schlocky runaround, bound for a guessable   twist that has an obvious precedent in the Scott canon.  The capable cast yank us through the chicanery, making welcome gestures towards a number of   ideas, but “  Frankenstein” isn’t one of the film’s smarter or more original ones.

Bridget Jones: how to turn a female character into half a billion dollars
If you’ve ever wondered how to make half a billion dollars out of a woman, then this is how it works.  First, take a book that gives life and shape to something millions of young women felt but couldn’t quite put into words. Second, turn it into a film whose lead actress will be asked over and over again about her weight for a decade, thus neatly illustrating why your lead character counts calories obsessively. Third, dull the genuinely acerbic edge of the novels, and defy all attempts to make this female Peter Pan grow up.  And there you have the formula  —   except if it were that easy, every studio in the world would have grossed $545m to date by churning out Bridget Jones films, the third of which hits British cinemas this Friday.  Few comic characters are embedded deeper in female psyches than Bridget, whose big pants and love of chardonnay are as much a part of British cultural furniture as “Don’t tell ’em, Pike!” and Victoria Wood’s hostess trolley song. In her time she has inspired everything from PhD theses to a speech by the then shadow pensions minister David Willetts but back in the 90s, she was simply part of what it meant to be young, female and racketing around the city with no real idea what you were doing.  I was 25 when I first stumbled across her fictional column in the Independent, and what she gave my friends and me was above all a shorthand a way of describing pivotal moments  —   mini breaks, fuckwittage, the urban family of friends who sustain you when your own family drive you mad  —   that simply became part of our language. The alien rituals of American dating culture, as immortalised in Sex and the City, fascinated us from a distance but Bridget was messy,   and real. She took things to absurd extremes, because that’s what made it funny. But it’s also what made her oddly comforting. However badly you screwed up, Bridget was the friend who invariably went one worse.  Yet the prospect of seeing her again after all this time leaves a surprising number of my female contemporaries cold. Like the   friend with whom you arrange a reunion only to find you have nothing in common, we wonder tentatively if it’s best to remember the friendship as it was.  “I WILL not sulk about having a boyfriend, but develop inner poise and authority and sense of self as woman of substance, complete without boyfriend, as best way to obtain boyfriend. ” There are some jokes that don’t wear thin, and Bridget’s creator, Helen Fielding, wrote her share of them. What she captured so brilliantly were all the paradoxes and contradictions of being young, thrillingly aware of all the choices open to you but confused about which of them you want torn between a wild independent life and the small anxious voice wondering if it might not actually be nice to settle down. It wasn’t Bridget’s   pursuit of a mini break but that mix of boldness and fear, of wanting and not wanting something, that rang so true.  “The thing I always felt about my 20s is that I felt bad because I didn’t have a boyfriend, and bad for wanting one,” says Bryony Gordon, the Telegraph columnist and author of a raucous bestselling memoir The Wrong Knickers, invariably touted as a   Bridget’s story. “But actually that’s totally normal. There’s nothing to be ashamed of about wanting someone to love. ” Shame and Bridget Jones, however, have always gone hand in hand. Barely had Fielding’s first volume of the diaries hit the bestseller lists before she was dismissed as frothy and forgettable, chick lit for women too lazy to read proper literature. Never mind, as the author Allison Pearson (whose equally iconic novel of working motherhood I Don’t Know How She Does It also began life as a column) argues, that the diaries are arguably part of a deep tradition of telling fiction through newspaper serials that stretches all the way back via Jan Struther’s wartime housewife Mrs Miniver to Charles Dickens’s Pickwick Papers. Worse, she was judged a lousy feminist. Curiously, while it was always enough for Adrian Mole just to be funny, Bridget had to be a role model for women created as a comic parody, she was judged like a moral fable, and duly found wanting.  Yet despite it all, the book, and then the 2001 movie, sold and sold and sold. If nothing else, Fielding proved that the stuff of women’s interior lives was worth something, and in doing so she helped popularise an entire genre not just of fiction but of   confessional writing from women.  At best, such openness was immensely liberating. “People call it oversharing and confessional and that slightly undermines it as a form of journalism,” says Gordon, who now writes a weekly column about life as a young mother.  “I would say this because that’s what I do, but I think there’s great power in it. The moment you write something down or say it out loud it has less power over you. ” But at its worst, it can feel    —   the Mail’s Liz Jones has written bleakly about how mining her life for material destroyed relationships  —   and  . And that’s the flipside of the endearingly   character Fielding created. Twenty years on, shouldn’t Bridget be thinking about something other than herself?  Fielding has tried, of course, to move her on. The third Bridget Jones novel  —   Mad About the Boy  —   saw her at 51 reluctantly single again, having married and had children with Darcy only to lose him to a hero’s death. But the darker, adult themes of midlife loss and grief sat queasily alongside the jolly sexual slapstick the film rights were not snapped up.  And so it’s back to the tried and trusted formula this week for Bridget Jones’s Baby, based on a Fielding screenplay, which sounds rather more the sort of thing Hollywood wants to hear. Her ageing process miraculously slowed down, Bridget is rewound to a   43, pregnant but unsure who the father is. Offscreen, controversy over the lead actress Renée Zellweger’s weight has been replaced with controversy over how she has or hasn’t aged since the last film 12 years ago  —   for all the world as if that had nothing to do with Hollywood’s refusal to let the character she plays age naturally, too. And that’s the thing. If there is a feminist lesson to be drawn here, it’s not from an imaginary woman but from an industry that grew very rich indeed on her  .  As Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the feminist thinktank the Fawcett Society, puts it, what happened to the real actress playing Bridget over the last 15 years is at least as revealing as what happened to the character: “She’s been vilified for changing her appearance, her body, her face  —   I think it’s appalling, the way she’s been through that. We might have a lot of affection for the character but we’ve treated the actor appallingly. ” Yet tough as it must have been for Zellweger to have her body turned into a public battleground, the weight she gained to play Bridget as a reassuringly normal size 12 in the first film felt genuinely significant at the time. Audiences were so used to tiny,   actresses that we had unthinkingly started accepting them as the norm her noticeably different Bridget was a wakeup call. How thin must Zellweger have been, if it took months of doughnuts and protein shakes to make her look normal? Watching her shrink and expand, like Alice down the rabbit hole, brought the debate over   culture to life. Ageism in Hollywood now looks ripe for the same treatment. After one critic reviewed the film’s trailers largely by speculating on whether she’d had surgery, Zellweger wrote an angry piece for the Huffington Post attacking what she called the “repellent suggestion that the value of a person and her professional contributions are diminished if she presumably caves to societal pressure about appearance”. Yet it’s not just societal pressure that forces actresses to stay unnaturally young, of course, but an industry refusing to create roles in which they could grow old. Pearson agrees that there’s an untapped desire to see older women’s lives authentically portrayed in popular culture  —   one reason she’s currently writing a sequel to I Don’t Know How She Does It, in which her menopausal heroine grapples with teenage kids, ageism in the City, and her husband’s midlife crisis. But as she points out, Kate was always a   struggling with   issues. Forcing a comic archetype like Bridget to deal with loss, mortality or darker adult themes would, she suggests, “be like giving a Wodehouse character an ugly divorce. If you gave Bertie Wooster a custody battle it’s not going to work, is it? They’re essentially conceived as sunshine, that’s the joke. ” So like James Bond, perhaps Bridget is destined always to be frozen in time, awaiting rediscovery by each new generation of anxiously conflicted young women.  But for those who grew up with Bridget, and have now for whatever reason grown beyond her, well, there’s always a nostalgic place for her in our hearts. But if she can’t grow old with us, then perhaps it’s best if we gently let her go.

Premier League 2015-16 season review: our writers’ best and worst
Paul Doyle Riyad Mahrez. Dominic Fifield You could take your pick from Jamie Vardy, N’Golo Kanté or Riyad Mahrez at Leicester but Mahrez gets my vote on the basis he offered invention and creation as well as goals from wide. It is astonishing to think he cost only a   fee when plucked from Le Havre in 2014. Owen Gibson Take your pick from any of those who worked miracles at the King Power but Kanté was the choice of those very players for good reason. Won more tackles and made more interceptions than any other player in the Premier League.  Barry Glendenning Kanté has been a revelation for Leicester. “No matter who we’re playing, we play three in midfield  —   Drinkwater in the middle and Kanté either side,” explained the club’s chief scout, Steve Walsh, in a fairly unbeatable description that tells us all we need to know. Andy Hunter Mahrez. 17 goals, 11 assists, glorious footwork and vision illuminated Leicester en route to the title but the Algerian’s character, which helped eke out several slender but crucial victories, completed the package. David Hytner Vardy. When I read last December that they were thinking about making a Hollywood movie out of his   I thought it might be a bit much. Now, it seems like the most obvious thing in the world. Jamie Jackson Wes Morgan. A supposed career journeyman who led Leicester with a coolness and assurance that will come to be viewed as one of the great feats of captaincy. Stuart James I’m giving it to Vardy for his all round contribution  —   24 goals, six assists, and breaking Ruud van Nistelrooy’s record. Amy Lawrence Mahrez. Of all the outstanding candidates from Leicester, he was the one who could make the crowd gasp with pure, creative technique. Scott Murray Virgil van Dijk. At some point, the penny will drop and a club other than Southampton will have a quick gander around the Scottish league. Sachin Nakrani Mahrez. His high point was the   nutmeg on Stoke’s Philipp Wollscheid which, four months on, continues to feel like a trick of the mind. Barney Ronay Vardy. The romantic choice but also an entirely sensible one. Both a nerveless goalscorer and the hare that made an entire team run behind him. Jacob Steinberg It feels harsh in the extreme to overlook Vardy’s goals and assists but I’m going to, simply because few things in life are better than watching an impish winger like Mahrez torment  .  Daniel Taylor Mahrez, with an honourable mention for Wes Morgan, who has come a long way since being part of the Nottingham Forest defence that sieved five to Yeovil Town in the League One  . Louise Taylor Mahrez. Although hats off to Claudio Ranieri and Leicester City for creating the right framework for him to strut his wonderful stuff. It would be very interesting to see how Mahrez might fare in a Tony Pulis or Alan Pardew team  —   what price he would have disappeared without trace or received the Hatem Ben Arfa treatment?  Paul Wilson I voted for Vardy as footballer of the year. If you cannot get recognition for climbing out of   football to win the title, break Van Nistelrooy’s Premier League scoring record and banging in the probable goal of the season against Liverpool what is the point of having an award?  Paul Doyle Claudio Ranieri. As José Mourinho meant to say once “Ranieri doesn’t need (more money than anyone else and a poisonous attitude) to win”. Dominic Fifield Ranieri. Clearly. And yes, I was one of the doubters who presumed he would be the first coach to be sacked. Owen Gibson Ranieri: his status as the most universally popular man to ever win the title may have obscured just how remarkable his blend of tactical nous and instinctive grasp of group psychology was.  Barry Glendenning Ranieri, obviously. A tip of the hat also to Eddie Howe and Slaven Bilic, whose good work at Bournemouth and West Ham respectively has been rather overshadowed. Andy Hunter Ranieri. Tweaked his approach to suit the players at his disposal, handled what everyone on the outside called mounting pressure with ease and good humour, tactically superb and a worthy champion. David Hytner Ranieri. No explanation necessary. Jamie Jackson Ranieri. A lovely man, too. Stuart James Ranieri. Not only did Ranieri do an extraordinary job with Leicester, he handled himself with dignity, humility and class throughout. Success could not happen to a nicer man. But be warned, Claudio, I nominated Garry Monk for this award last year   …     Amy Lawrence Dilly ding, dilly dong all the way. Every single thing Ranieri has done all season has been magnifico. Scott Murray Sam Allardyce masterminded yet another outrageous Sunderland escape against all the odds, the Harry Houdini and Dick Advocaat de nos jours. Poor Rafa, though. Sachin Nakrani Ranieri. “Veni, vidi, vici,” as they might say in Ranieri’s native Rome. Barney Ronay Ranieri, obviously, with honourable mentions for Mauricio Pochettino’s running game, Howe’s excellence and the enduring Bigness of Sam. Jacob Steinberg Ranieri, who will presumably begin his first press conference next season by announcing that his ultimate aim is Premier League survival, before he goes on to beat Barcelona   in the Champions League final thanks to 23% possession and a winner from Wes Morgan. Daniel Taylor Ranieri, though I can’t help feel Quique Sánchez Flores would have been a decent choice any other year and wonder what more Watford could possibly have wanted. Louise Taylor It’s got to be Claudio. Brilliant man management, brilliant tactical tweaking, brilliant everything.  Paul Wilson Well though Pochettino and Jürgen Klopp have done it would be perverse to suggest anyone other than Ranieri. A class act from the start. Paul Doyle Dele Alli’s control, overhead flick and   volley against Crystal Palace was poetry. Dominic Fifield Alli’s goal to turn a tight contest in Tottenham Hotspur’s favour at Crystal Palace in January. Instinctive and stunning. Owen Gibson Alli v Crystal Palace. Amid a fine season for club and country, the fearless    played at times as though he was still in the schoolyard.  Barry Glendenning Vardy’s outrageous   volley against Liverpool in February was perhaps the most sublime Roy of the Rovers moment in a Roy of the Rovers season for the Leicester City striker. Andy Hunter Vardy v Liverpool. I’m always partial to a “pick that out” screamer but there was a little more to Vardy’s   shot over Simon Mignolet than the stunning execution. Mahrez’s ball and the significance of the goal  —   setting Leicester on their way to a win that kept them three points clear at the top ahead of the trip to Manchester City  —   added to the moment. David Hytner Cuco Martina v Arsenal, a       curler 19 minutes into his full league debut for Southampton. Even Martina looked stunned. Jamie Jackson Eden Hazard’s title decider against Spurs. The reigning double footballer of the year has hardly been a goal machine but his third of the season was hailed around the world. Stuart James Vardy’s brilliant dipping   lob, on the run, against Liverpool in February. You know that something special has happened when people are on their feet in the press box. Amy Lawrence A top five in no particular order you say? That’s just about managable: Vardy’s screeching first time volley Liverpool Dimitri Payet’s    free kick against Crystal Palace Martina’s absurd curler against Arsenal Alli’s delicate footwork on the turn against Palace and Hazard’s title swinger against Tottenham. Scott Murray “To be honest I was looking all game, because he was quite far off his line. ” Vardy on the questionable positioning of Mignolet, and why he bought a ticket to the raffle from 35 yards. Sachin Nakrani Martina for Southampton against Arsenal. I heard this goal before I saw it, listening to Southampton’s home game against Arsenal on the radio. The commentator went bananas and my initial thought was “there’s no way the goal is that good”  —   it was. Barney Ronay Vardy spanks it past Mignolet on the run. Planned and executed brilliantly. Jacob Steinberg In terms of its significance, it has to be Mahrez bamboozling the Manchester City defence with a drop of the shoulder, a swerve of the hips and a dazzling stepover before putting Leicester   up at the Etihad.  Daniel Taylor Matt Ritchie for Bournemouth against Sunderland. It’s the angle behind the man that shows it best  —   the chest control, the spinning volley and then the power of the shot, off the outside of his boot, as it arcs into the top corner. Louise Taylor Vurnon Anita for Newcastle United against Manchester City. The midfielder, operating out of position at   had not scored for more than two years when he met Moussa Sissoko’s clever pass, dodged Aleksandar Kolarov, cut inside and shot unerringly beyond Hart.  Paul Wilson Vardy against Liverpool. There were other candidates, but Vardy’s devastating strike from such a long way out summed up the audacity of Leicester’s title challenge. Paul Doyle Leicester   Aston Villa. This summed up a thrilling and barmy season, as Aston Villa looked deceptively slick for about an hour, going   up through fine goals, before being blown away by the rising champions in a stonking atmosphere. Dominic Fifield The most dramatic I witnessed   were those at Stamford Bridge as José Mourinho’s tenure at the then champions unravelled. Perhaps Bournemouth’s late victory in December, as the end edged inexorably closer, was the most  . It all seems such a long time ago. Owen Gibson Leicester City’s humbling of Manchester City at the Etihad  —   a performance full of pace, power and ferocious intent (not to mention two goals from Robert Huth).  Barry Glendenning Norwich City   Liverpool had pretty much everything, including a pair of spectacles smashed in the celebrations following Adam Lallana’s late, late winner. Andy Hunter Manchester City   Leicester City. For importance, a complete team performance and a game that announced something remarkable was occurring in the Premier League, nothing compared to it. David Hytner Newcastle United   Manchester United. Thrilling lunacy, largely because most people fully expected a dismal   between two teams who did not know where the net was. Paul Dummett’s   equaliser for Newcastle brought the house down. Jamie Jackson Manchester City   Leicester City. A display that included Mahrez bamboozling three defenders plus Hart to score the second just after the break. Ranieri’s men gained a   lead and never looked back. Stuart James Manchester City   Leicester City. With 20 minutes to go a message flashed up from Leicester’s official twitter account that read: “So if you’re just joining us. .. #lcfc are leading   and Robert Huth is on a  . ” What a wonderfully bonkers game.  Amy Lawrence Tottenham   Chelsea. A sensational game with a load of drama and a meaningful outcome. It might not have been to the purist’s tastes with the odes to Chopper Harris and all that but witnessing such souped up commitment was special. Scott Murray Chelsea   Tottenham Hotspur. An   donnybrook that emptied the benches and spilled down the tunnel. Marvellous entertainment. It even adhered to the old   joke: in the middle of it all, a football match broke out.  Sachin Nakrani Leicester   Chelsea. A night when English football’s tectonic plates shifted. Leicester returned to top spot with a display over the champions that was so dominant that the thought of them winning the title no longer felt outlandish.  Barney Ronay Right now the last one I went to, the wild, loopy farewell to Upton Park. Comebacks, goals, terrible defending, violence, sentimental music, angry people talking about buses. What more could anyone want? Jacob Steinberg The final game at Upton Park. Atmosphere, emotion and incredible drama as West Ham beat Manchester United  . Daniel Taylor Manchester City   Leicester City. The day when most people realised Leicester weren’t going anywhere. The score flattered Manchester City and it was   to see a team of their riches dismantled that way on their own ground. Louise Taylor As north east correspondent there’s certainly a few candidates for worst match but the best? Possibly Newcastle   Chelsea  —   back in the day when there was still hope for both Steve McClaren and Mourinho. Chelsea were two down but pulled it back courtesy of fine goals from Ramires and Willian. Paul Wilson Either Manchester City   Liverpool, or Manchester City   Leicester City, both of which I had the privilege to attend. Probably the latter, in terms of waking everyone up to the quality and ruthlessness the eventual champions could bring to bear. Paul Doyle Mike Dean still has the best celebrations. Dominic Fifield Mark Clattenburg appears to be the governing body’s official of choice, but even the most innocuous decision is put under so much high definition,   scrutiny these days that every team or fan will have their own particular gripe with each referee. Owen Gibson He’s been chosen to referee the Champions League final so Clattenburg can’t be too shabby. Clattenburg is rarely caught out of position and retains a natural authority.  Barry Glendenning The sign of a good referee is one whose presence goes unnoticed, so it’s difficult to say. Most seem to do a fairly decent job in almost impossible circumstances. Andy Hunter Michael Oliver, Clattenburg and Anthony Taylor have all improved this season. Of course they remain capable of the occasional error and Oliver would be the preference for how he handles and communicates with players. David Hytner Clattenburg. He deserves to have the Champions League final. Seems to get most of the big decisions right. Jamie Jackson All or none of them. It’s the impossible job tackled by a bunch of brave souls. Or the possible job tackled by a bunch of   souls. You decide. Stuart James Not a category to get excited about but Clattenburg strikes me as a decent referee with the social skills to “get on” with players while still doing his job. Amy Lawrence The fact that Clattenburg has the Champions League final shows he is rated pretty highly by his peers. Scott Murray Clattenburg, for his delicate,   handling of Chelsea   Tottenham. Here’s to another freewheeling,   windmilling classic in the Champions League final, starring Clattenburg, Sergio Ramos and Diego Simeone. Sachin Nakrani Unlike 99% of people who watch football in this country, I don’t have a strong view on referees. They all seem roughly the same and their mistakes, while occasionally astonishing, never entice me into reaching for a pitchfork. If I had to chose someone, I’d go for Jon Moss. Just to annoy Twitter. Barney Ronay We need to stop talking about referees. Jacob Steinberg Probably not Moss. Michael Oliver has been fine. None of them stand out, though.  Daniel Taylor Clattenburg, probably. Oliver is usually reasonable as well, with Moss at the other end of the scale. Louise Taylor Clattenburg. Apart from clearly being an excellent technician his communication skills set him a little bit apart. Paul Wilson Graham Poll, or Keith Hackett, or any other the other   who never made a mistake in their active careers but now turn up in various media outlets criticising the poor performances of their successors. You should not have had to issue three yellow cards to the same player in a World Cup to understand that referees have a difficult job and are not going to be perfect all the time. Respect should start at home. Paul Doyle From John Stones to Mats Hummels, everyone covets a central defender who can build from the back but Southampton got themselves ones that can actually defend, too. Virgil Van Dijk replaced Toby Alderweireld so well after signing from Celtic last summer that Southampton have already given him a new   contract. Dominic Fifield N’Golo Kanté at Leicester City. Owen Gibson Kanté, again. At just £5. 6m from Caen, the unassuming Frenchman who drives a Mini to training was the snip of the season.. Barry Glendenning Kanté. Andy Hunter Kanté. There is no competition for the player that Steve Walsh, Leicester’s head of recruitment, convinced Ranieri to sign for £5. 6m from Caen last summer. First for tackles and interceptions in the Premier League this season. Where were all the other scouts? David Hytner Alderweireld. Tottenham were weak at the back last season. This time out, they conceded fewer goals than anybody in the division. The Belgian has barely put a foot wrong.  Jamie Jackson Anthony Martial, £36m rising to £58. 8m. The Frenchman is only 19 but is at least a class above the rest at Manchester United. Expect him to play for Real Madrid or Barcelona before he is finished. Stuart James Kanté by a distance. Runs miles, forever throwing himself into tackles and making interceptions, and never looks remotely tired. He can play as well. And Leicester got all of that for £5. 6m. Amy Lawrence Kanté. If Carlsberg made adverts for football scouts . .. Scott Murray Martial, who could potentially cost Manchester United £58. 8m, had quite a bit to prove. It took him 22 minutes of his debut, against Liverpool, to get that job out of the way. Sachin Nakrani Kantéhas established himself as one of the most dynamic and consistently excellent midfielders in the country. Barney Ronay Kanté, a midfielder who appears to “cover every blade of grass” but in fact only covers the ones he really needs to, albeit with real drive and craft. Jan Kirchhoff, Wahbi Khazri and Lamine Koné wasn’t a bad January treble. Jacob Steinberg Kanté’s midfield dynamism, diligence and quality has ensured that Leicester did not suffer from losing Esteban Cambiasso, their best player last season. Daniel Taylor Kanté. Steve Walsh, Leicester’s head of recruitment, put it nicely when he described their midfield as: “Drinkwater in the middle and Kanté either side. ” Louise Taylor Kirchhoff. To Sunderland from Bayern Munich reserves for £750, 000 in January. An apparently failed centre half, the German was immediately converted to an anchoring midfielder and has helped transform Wearside fortunes. Talk about value for money. Paul Wilson Kanté is the obvious answer here, but let’s give the Leicester theme a rest and go for Alderweireld. Most of the big clubs were in the market for defenders, Tottenham signed one of the best for a very reasonable £11. 4m. The Belgian has barely put a foot wrong all season. Paul Doyle José Mourinho. Hopefully, as lobbyists tried to land him the Manchester Untied job at last, Mourinho has spent recent months exploring the one conspiracy theory that he has not yet publicly examined: he was the architect of his own spectacular downfall. Dominic Fifield Florian Thauvin’s three Premier League starts after a £12m move from Marseille probably drew the line under Newcastle’s dalliance with the French market, particularly as he ended the season back at Stade Vélodrome on loan. Owen Gibson Chelsea’s title defence. So many things went wrong that it’s hard to know here to start but the destabilising Eva Carneiro farce is as good a place as any. Antonio Conte has a big job on his hands.  Barry Glendenning Thauvin turned up at Newcastle in a tuxedo and left on loan in ignominy after failing to register an assist or goal in 13 Premier League appearances after his £12m move from Marseille on a   deal. Five years! Andy Hunter Mourinho and Chelsea. From comfortable title winners in May to a disorganised, uncommitted and weak team with 12 defeats to its name by Christmas. Chelsea’s players were rightly blamed for getting another manager the sack but that does not excuse Mourinho’s part in his downfall. David Hytner Memphis Depay. The £25m arrival from PSV Eindhoven has shown flickers of his ability but there have been too many times when he has failed to make any impact. Jamie Jackson Bastian Schweinsteiger. Plagued all year by injury, as he was in recent seasons at Bayern Munich: what were Manchester United doing buying him? Stuart James Aston Villa could make a legitimate case to “own” this category. As for some individual contenders, Depay, Christian Benteke, Pedro, Thauvin and Raheem Sterling must be in the mix, and what on earth happened to that bloke called Eder at Swansea? Amy Lawrence Mourinho. The unseemly episode surrounding Carneiro on the opening day of the season set a dreadful tone. It is hard to think of a title defence as pitiful as Chelsea’s this season and that came straight from the manager. Scott Murray Benteke scored a spectacular bicycle kick at Old Trafford, tucked away the most nerveless penalty of the season at Crystal Palace, and was one of only three players to score a winner against Leicester. But if relationships don’t click, they don’t click. Mind you, if he comes off the bench to decide the Europa League final, there’s a   dilemma and a half for Jürgen Klopp. Sachin Nakrani Chelsea. It started badly  —   with Mourinho lashing out at club doctors  —   and did not get much better.  Barney Ronay Eden Hazard on a    flop scale: surely the most flaccid reigning player of the year ever.  Jacob Steinberg Arsène Wenger. This was the year when Arsenal were supposed to make the most of all that potential. Yet even though Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City have all underperformed, seemingly leaving the path clear for Arsenal, they still couldn’t capitalise. Daniel Taylor Hazard. Did Mourinho really once say that Hazard might have overtaken Cristiano Ronaldo as the most phenomenal player on the planet bar Lionel Messi?  Louise Taylor If we are talking managers   Mourinho. If it’s players   Thauvin, the fragile winger Newcastle signed from Marseille for more than £12m but who is now back in the south of France on loan. Paul Wilson Were you to ask the Manchester City fans in my local they would unhesitatingly point the finger at Sterling, though in his case flop might be a tad harsh. If the definition of flop is a big reputation delivering little in the way of results, look no further than Steve McClaren at Newcastle. Paul Doyle Chris Kamara plays the jester role well and Owen Hargreaves is quietly insightful. Dominic Fifield Gary Neville up to the moment he opted to pursue a career in management with Valencia, though Jamie Carragher upped his game impressively thereafter.  Owen Gibson Five years after being mocked for knowing nothing about Hatem Ben Arfa, Alan Shearer is a man transformed. Fully committing himself to television work has paid off and he has become a major reason why Match of the Day no longer has to be fast forwarded between games.  Barry Glendenning Danny Higginbotham has proved quite the revelation since filing his first column for The Sentinel in Stoke a couple of years ago and is increasingly in demand. Andy Hunter Graeme Souness once again, although he can stray into “in my day” territory too often. A commanding, insightful presence otherwise. David Hytner Jermaine Jenas. Having only recently retired, he has a connection to many of the players and offers excellent insight into their playing styles and personalities. Has a nice way of making his tactical points. Jamie Jackson Chris Sutton. Loves  —   really loves  —   an opinion.  Stuart James Graeme Souness talks a lot of sense. Sharp with his analysis, not afraid to tell it how it is and not the sort to trot out those throwaway lines, like: “They’ve got enough to stay up. ” Amy Lawrence Graeme Souness. His straight talking style of punditry and excellent analysis is always of a high standard. Scott Murray A   between Michael Owen and Chris Sutton, who before Norwich v Liverpool in January were asked: will Norwich stay up? Owen: “No. ” Will Liverpool make the Champions League places? Sutton: “No. ” Not a beat skipped. Refreshingly honest, pandering to nobody. Admittedly there are other issues here, but let’s accentuate the positive. Sachin Nakrani Jamie Carragherstepped out of Gary Neville’s shadow and has become the leading voice on Monday Night Football, consistently showing a thoughtful, intelligent approach to football analysis.  Barney Ronay Graeme Souness. It’s always Souness. Frankly he could spend 30 minutes reading out the ingredients of a tin of baked beans over and over again and so long as he did it with a look of pure wincing soulfully exasperated contempt I’d watch right to the end. Jacob Steinberg Owen Hargreaves and Rio Ferdinand have been very good on Champions League nights, while Jamie Carragher is exemplary on Monday Night Football, but no one is as watchable as a seething Graeme Souness. Daniel Taylor Jamie Carragher asks the right questions, makes good points and writes an excellent column for the Daily Mail too. Graeme Souness is always watchable and, on radio, David Pleat is perhaps the best judge of a player (he told me Dele Alli would be a star a long time back).  Louise Taylor David Pleat on Radio 5 Live. Clear, concise and tells you something new in good English.  Paul Wilson I don’t know. But I think Gary Neville might be the bravest. Paul Doyle The fact that every gripe is merely the prelude to a triumphant explanation by Roberto Martínez. Dominic Fifield José Mourinho’s reaction to a member of his medical staff performing her duties in stoppage time on the campaign’s opening day against Swansea City. Owen Gibson That even a life affirming, joyously unpredictable season was undercut by the constant, dispiriting drip drip about a European Super League, a closed shop Champions League, guaranteed European qualification for the biggest “brands” or whatever.  Barry Glendenning Assorted players, managers, fans, broadcasters, journalists and other football folk griping far too angrily about unimportant matters. Andy Hunter Contributing, as a taxpayer, towards West Ham United’s exorbitant relocation to the Olympic Stadium and thereby improving the investment portfolio of a couple of  . David Hytner For some reason, I hate it when the league is referred to as ‘The Barclays Premier League,’ either in copy or on TV. It’s not incorrect, just jarring. Jamie Jackson The view that Leicester City cannot win the Champions League. Really? If a misfiring Manchester City can be a goal away from the final, why the heck not? Stuart James When Bafetimbi Gomis scored at Manchester City, ending a      goal drought, and decided not to do his “panther” celebration. You try explaining that kind of behaviour to his biggest fan (aged four). Just messing with kids’ minds, leaving parents to pick up the pieces. What you did after scoring at Upton Park last Saturday, Gomis, was too little too late. Amy Lawrence The growing sense of entitlement that grips certain clubs and certain fanbases. Scott Murray No matches over the Easter holidays. International friendlies simply don’t cut it on English football’s traditional   weekend, no matter how many   leads the world champions let slip. Sachin Nakrani The ubiquity of betting adverts. The gambling industry has wrapped itself around football in this country, and that is seen most starkly with the number of ads for bookies. Most of them are terrible and it will be a great day when I am able to turn on my TV and not be confronted by Ray Winstone’s massive head. Barney Ronay Teams chasing the title should play as much as possible on the same day. I know. TV. But it doesn’t work well as a spectacle or as good sporting practice. Jacob Steinberg I only went to Villa Park once this season, to see Tim Sherwood’s Aston Villa lose   to Stoke City, and there was an intolerable apathy and sadness about the place. Villa are in danger of being run into the ground by Randy Lerner and their stay in the Championship could be a long one. Daniel Taylor Managers who try to deceive everyone in press conferences by pretending their team has played well, usually after   defeats, and the number of famous Leicester fans who have suddenly turned up (who, funnily enough, I never remember seeing in four years of covering the club on a daily basis). Louise Taylor That Newcastle United did not replace Steve McClaren with Rafa Benítez a little sooner.  Paul Wilson Monday night football. If it has to happen, and I suppose television is paying enough money to do pretty much as it chooses, could not the games be selected a little more randomly? I don’t think it was fair that Tottenham had to play on three consecutive Mondays at the end of the season. Paul Doyle Transparent and accurate  . Clocks should be seen to be stopped for goal celebrations, substitutions, natters before   rolling around and whenever the ball goes out of play. Everyone should know exactly long is left.  Dominic Fifield How about having     squads, with a guarantee that at least five (a number plucked from the ether) have been nurtured through the club’s academy or youth system? That might encourage a few more youngsters on the benches with a chance of   in the top flight. Owen Gibson Almost certainly a folorn hope, especially with the advent of Friday night Premier League football, but it would be nice if the new £30 price cap on away tickets was accompanied by at least a modicum of respect for the most loyal fans in the game when it comes to fixtures shunted around the calendar for television at short notice.  Barry Glendenning A bit of consideration for travelling fans from TV schedulers   their Saturday lunchtime matches is probably too much to hope for. Andy Hunter Transfer deadline day being the day before the Premier League season starts. David Hytner It’s an old chestnut but the clubs have to do more to lower the price of tickets. With the new TV deal incoming, they can afford it. It’s so wrong that many parents cannot afford to take their kids. Jamie Jackson Referees to give   interviews. Stuart James Cancel the introduction of Friday night Premier League football  —   a rubbish idea (you only need to look at the Aston   United game last August to know that). Amy Lawrence It would be great for the train companies to put on more services, especially late ones, to cover fans getting home from night games.  Scott Murray The removal of all electronic scoreboards, big screens and animated hoardings. No shirt sponsorship. Plastic flags, clappers and mobile phones to be replaced by rattles, flat caps and untipped cigarettes. Match of the Day to be transmitted in black and white. Sachin Nakrani An end to ridiculous   times. But that would require the Premier League standing up to Sky Sports and BT Sport, which sadly is highly unlikely to happen.  Barney Ronay Players covering their mouths like FBI mafiosi suspects while having routine conversations about nightclubs and designer watches punished by being forced to repeat verbatim their entire conversation on camera  —   in the voice of Daffy Duck. Jacob Steinberg This is probably world’s smallest violin playing the world’s saddest song territory but Manuel Pellegrini did have a point when he complained about the questionable scheduling of domestic matches before Champions League ties.  Daniel Taylor A proper,   debate about   (ideally, leading to it being introduced). The clue is in the title  —   it’s safe  —   and there are people on Merseyside who want this debate, too. Louise Taylor Abolish Friday night football. No one needs it. A field too far.  Paul Wilson The   at Liverpool over proposed ticket prices has largely been forgotten about since, what with the Klopp revolution, a European final and the Hillsborough verdicts. Football admission is never going to be cheap again, not in the way that it once was, but one would like to think both clubs and spectators have got the message that organised terrace protest can help keep a greedy industry in check.
